(CVE:GR) then it's worth thinking about how it contributes to the volatility of your portfolio, overall. In finance, Beta is a measure of volatility. Modern finance theory considers volatility to be a measure of risk, and there are two main types of price volatility. The first type is company specific volatility. Investors use diversification across uncorrelated stocks to reduce this kind of price volatility across the portfolio. The second type is the broader market volatility, which you cannot diversify away, since it arises from macroeconomic factors which directly affects all the stocks on the market.\n\nSome stocks are more sensitive to general market forces than others. Beta can be a useful tool to understand how much a stock is influenced by market risk (volatility). However, Warren Buffett said 'volatility is far from synonymous with risk' in his 2014 letter to investors. So, while useful, beta is not the only metric to consider. To use beta as an investor, you must first understand that the overall market has a beta of one. A stock with a beta greater than one is more sensitive to broader market movements than a stock with a beta of less than one.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Great Atlantic Resources\n\nWhat we can learn from GR's beta value\n\nZooming in on Great Atlantic Resources, we see it has a five year beta of 1.21. This is above 1, so historically its share price has been influenced by the broader volatility of the stock market. If the past is any guide, we would expect that Great Atlantic Resources shares will rise quicker than the markets in times of optimism, but fall faster in times of pessimism. Beta is worth considering, but it's also important to consider whether Great Atlantic Resources is growing earnings and revenue. You can take a look for yourself, below.\n\nTSXV:GR Income Statement, January 1st 2020 More\n\nCould GR's size cause it to be more volatile?\n\nGreat Atlantic Resources is a rather small company. It has a market capitalisation of CA$3.3m, which means it is probably under the radar of most investors. Relatively few investors can influence the price of a smaller company, compared to a large company. This could explain the high beta value, in this case.\n\nWhat this means for you:\n\nSince Great Atlantic Resources has a reasonably high beta, it's worth considering why it is so heavily influenced by broader market sentiment. For example, it might be a high growth stock or have a lot of operating leverage in its business model. In order to fully understand whether GR is a good investment for you, we also need to consider important company-specific fundamentals such as Great Atlantic Resources\u2019s financial health and performance track record.
