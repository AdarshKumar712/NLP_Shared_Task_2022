During an interview Monday, Greta said she doubts she would have talked to President Trump at last fall\u2019s climate summit in New York because \u201che\u2019s not listening to the scientists and experts, so why would he listen to me?\u201d (Pontus Lundahl/TT via AP)\n\nTeenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg said Monday that talking to President Trump at a United Nations summit on global warming would have been a waste of time, because he would not have paid attention.\n\nIn an interview with BBC radio\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d program, for which she was the guest editor Monday, Greta also said that she regarded personal attacks on her as funny and that she hoped to go back to having a normal life.\n\nA video of the 16-year-old Swedish campaigner giving Trump what media described as a \u201cdeath stare\u201d at a U.N. climate summit in New York in September went viral on social media. Trump has questioned climate science and is pulling the United States out of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change.\n\nAsked what she would have said to the president if they had spoken, Greta said: \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think I would have said anything because obviously he\u2019s not listening to scientists and experts, so why would he listen to me?\n\n\u201cSo I probably wouldn\u2019t have said anything. I wouldn\u2019t have wasted my time,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nGreta watches as Trump enters the United Nations to speak with reporters at the summit September 23. (Andrew Hofstetter/Reuters)\n\nThis month Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called Greta \u201ca brat.\u201d Trump has said on Twitter she needs to work on her anger management problem.\n\n\u201cThose attacks are just funny because they obviously don\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess of course it means something \u2014 they are terrified of young people bringing change which they don\u2019t want \u2014 but that is just proof that we are actually doing something and that they see us as some kind of threat.\u201d\n\nGreta came to world attention when she began a grass-roots campaign at age 15 by skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside the Swedish parliament. The protests have inspired millions of young people to take action against climate change.\n\nThunberg, who was named Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year for 2019, said becoming an activist had helped rescue her from the depression she had previously been suffering.\n\nThe teenager rejoined activists outside the Swedish parliament this month after four months of overseas trips to attend climate conferences in New York and Madrid.\n\n\u201cI hope I won\u2019t have to sit outside the Swedish parliament for long. I hope I don\u2019t have to be a climate activist anymore,\u201d she said, adding she was looking forward to returning to school in August.\n\n\u201cI just want to be just as everyone else. I want to educate myself and be just like a normal teenager.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Associated Press\n\nRead more from KidsPost:\n\nNo bold plans come from United Nations climate summit\n\nGreta Thunberg\u2019s trip to New York inspires young climate activists\n\nStudents worldwide walk out of school to push for action on climate change", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["climate change summit", "president trump and climate change", "climate activist greta thunberg"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Associated Press", "December At Pm"], "publish_date": "Mon Dec 30 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Teen climate activist says the president isn\u2019t listening to scientists and wouldn\u2019t listen to her.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"object-hash": 1577742970, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "keywords": "climate change summit, president trump and climate change, climate activist greta thunberg", "news_keywords": "climate change summit, president trump and climate change, climate activist greta thunberg", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/greta-thunberg-says-talking-to-trump-would-be-a-waste-of-time/2019/12/30/0dd01612-21ab-11ea-a153-dce4b94e4249_story.html", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yNkwEvA5XPXY38qYbJPwzkxT6_I=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QSF3QMRLF4I6VPFTVRSIFRFJF4.jpg", "title": "Greta Thunberg says talking to Trump would be a waste of time", "description": "Teen climate activist says the president isn\u2019t listening to scientists and wouldn\u2019t listen to her."}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"app_id": 41245586762, "admins": 500835072}, "description": "Teen climate activist says the president isn\u2019t listening to scientists and wouldn\u2019t listen to her.", "robots": "index,follow", "theme": "normal"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/greta-thunberg-says-talking-to-trump-would-be-a-waste-of-time/2019/12/30/0dd01612-21ab-11ea-a153-dce4b94e4249_story.html"}
