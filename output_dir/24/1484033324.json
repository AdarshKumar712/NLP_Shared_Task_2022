They were trailed by neighboring float builder in Irwindale, Phoenix Decorating Co., which had six award-winners.\n\nThe floats were judged during the decorating stages before the parade. Scores were based on the float designers\u2019 creativity, floral craftsmanship, artistic merit, computerized animation, thematic interpretation, floral and color presentation, as well as dramatic impact, according to a news release from the Tournament of Roses.\n\nHere are the rest of the winners:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Top Stories PSN", "Rose Bowl", "Rose Parade", "New Year's Day"], "authors": ["Bradley Bermont", "Bradley Bermont Is A Reporter In Los Angeles.
