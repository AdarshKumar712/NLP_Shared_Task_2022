H. Frick on The Philal\u00e8thes Tuesday, August 25th, 2009 | Freemasonry, Philal\u00e8thes | No Comments The following sketch is translated from Karl R. H. Frick\u2019s Die Erleuchteten: Gnostisch-theosophische und alchemistisch-rosenkreuzerische Geheimgesellschaften bis zum Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts, ein Beitrag zur Geistesgeschichte der Neuzeit (1973), p. 574 ff., originally included as an appendix at the end of McBean and Gabirro, A Complete History Of The Ancient And Primitive Rite (2002). There were a few mistakes with spelling and grammar, etc., so I\u2019ve cleaned it up, while providing annotations, links and illustrations. In regard to the entire milieu of high-grade Freemasonry during the Enlightenment, the Philal\u00e8thes are as noteworthy as they come. The Rite itself - more of a regime - and the Lodge \u2018Amis R\u00e9unis\u2019 from which it was founded, constituted a clearing house for all things occult or esoteric on the continent and beyond; Savalette de Langes and the Marquis de Chefdebien may even be described as engaging in Masonic espionage. There isn\u2019t a single volume on 18th Century Freemasonry that doesn\u2019t give the major details of the Amis R\u00e9unis and the Philal\u00e8thes. Members of the rite came not only from France, but from Germany, England, Italy, Austria, Sweden and Russia (and as was shown with the publishing of J. J. C. Bode\u2019s diary in 1994, the Bavarian Illuminati had managed to officially join forces with it just two years before the revolution). I\u2019ve read more than a few accounts of the Philal\u00e8thes over the years, but this report by Frick - about as complete an introduction as as you\u2019ll find - is by far the best. *** \u203a Continue reading\n\nLodge of Les Amis R\u00e9unis [The United Friends] Tuesday, August 25th, 2009 | Freemasonry, Philal\u00e8thes | 2 Comments We\u2019ll be mentioning this famous Lodge in Paris in forthcoming posts. What follows is a concise explanation of its operation and makeup (translated from a French Masonic Encyclopedia entry by Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Pinaud). *** Amis R\u00e9unis From 1771 to 1791, this lodge was one of the most prestigious in Paris and was consecrated by the Keeper of the Royal Treasury Savalette de Langes. Initially formed abroad in Rumigny, a small town of Thi\u00e9rache, by a magistrate of the Parliament of Paris (banished by Chancellor Maupeou), in 1773 the lodge settled permanently in Paris. Savalette de Langes had made the inner circle of the Amis R\u00e9unis the social center of modern Freemasonry and cosmopolitanism of the late Enlightenment. Here the elite and and the talented joined together. The orchestra of the Amis R\u00e9unis was composed of six musicians of renown, like the composer [Isidore] Bertheaume, the brothers Blasius, the King\u2019s violinists, Boutray of the l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie [Royale] de Musique, and either the brothers Breval or Louis Francoeur, the King\u2019s Superintendent of Music. The Lodge utilized a large space in a house in the Rue Popincourt, built in 1708 by the architect Dulin for the supplier of arms [Nicholas?] Dunoyer. Upon his death in 1791, Les Amis R\u00e9unis counted some 300 members with a further 37 casual brothers and brother servants. It comprised about 12% foreigners, such as the Baron de Beutz, chancellor of Saxony; the Baron de Gleichen, Minister of Denmark in Madrid, Naples and Paris; and Count Stroganoff, a Russian subject. A hundred senior officers or generals decorate the pillars, and about fifteen of their regiment. Painters and sculptors are well represented with a dozen doctors, all members of the Academy of Medicine or professors at the University of Paris - Monge was an assiduous member of the lodge for some years. But the Amis R\u00e9unis\u2019 uniqueness is the significant number of its members who belonged to the world of finance: 37% of the Lodge in total, 84 people, were indeed financiers. We count no fewer than 15 bankers or speculators, 13 receiver generals, 7 tax collectors [fermiers g\u00e9n\u00e9raux], 7 general treasurers including those of the Navy and War, 4 general paymasters, 19 members of the Courts of Finances of Paris, 7 senior officials of the Royal treasury and finally, 11 brothers who were occupied with public finance. On the eve of the Revolution, the lodge of the Amis R\u00e9unis had the highest concentration of financiers; a number of them met in groups, or independently, to engage in speculative ventures. We also find Lodge members as shareholders of the arms factory in Charleville, the Water Company in Paris, and the mines at Ba\u00efgorry, Decize or Rueil. Another group actively participated in speculation about the dollars held by the bank St. Charles de Madrid. Others are shareholders of the Hudson Bay Company that traded with Canada. Many specialize in international commerce, and others with India or the islands trading sugar and rum, but also the slave trade. At the famous East India Company, one finds Lodge members as shareholders or as administrators. A last group is actively involved in real estate speculation in Paris. The success of the Amis R\u00e9unis in the financial world may be explained by the fact that, in the latter third of the 18th-century, in the absence of public credit, only powerful financiers could undertake large scale financial transactions. Everything is then prefaced upon trust. This leads to the membership of professional lobbyists, and familial networks which are found in the Lodge. The trustworthiness of Masonic affiliation may result in more business, which enables both administrators and profiteers. The Lodge therefore offered a discreet setting for financial conversations and the development of protective relationships; philosophical bonds are then the natural extension in the world of finance.\n\nThe So-Called Schwedenkiste (\u201cSwedish Box\u201d), the Most Significant Illuminati Archive Wednesday, June 17th, 2009 | Primary Documents | 7 Comments by Terry Melanson (17/6/2009) After Adam Weishaupt had fled in 1785, the center of activity for the Illuminati shifted from Bavaria to the Duchies of Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Weimar. And while the founder of the Illuminati was content to safely settle down for the long haul at the court of Duke Ernst II of Saxe Gotha, Johann Joachim Christoph Bode (1730-1793) took the reins and assumed the role previously held by Weishaupt. Through the efforts of Bode and an expanding network of recruits \u2013 and under the protection of the Illuminati Dukes Karl August of Saxe-Weimar and Ernst II of Saxe-Gotha \u2013 new colonies were established in places like France, Russia and Italy. Bode kept the Weimar and Gotha Lodges Amalia and Ernst Zum Kompass informed of his activities, but the bulk of the evidence of continued Illuminati activity remained in his possession. Ensuring that whatever they contained would remain secret, upon Bode\u2019s death in December 1793 his literary executor, Illuminatus Christian Gottlieb von Voigt (1743\u20131819), transferred his deceased friend\u2019s possessions to Duke Ernst II of Saxe-Gotha who had already bought the voluminous papers before Bode died. \u203a Continue reading\n\n\u201cMaster Conspiracy\u201d Redux Monday, June 15th, 2009 | Illuminati myths | 9 Comments by Terry Melanson (15/6/2009) The New American website has posted a slightly redacted version of William H. McIlhany\u2019s 1996 article which appeared in the September 16, 1996 issue of The New American. (The original can be read here, which, in turn, appears to be based on one of McIlhany\u2019s presentations). I first became aware of McIlhany\u2019s writings on the Illuminati in 2000. At the time I was very impressed by what I read, and immediately realized that his information on the real Bavarian Illuminati was more thorough than most. However, my own knowledge on the subject is a bit more advanced than it was some nine years ago. So with that in mind, here are some exaggerations and/or misrepresentations which struck me as I reread the article at The New American for the first time in years. \u201cK\u00f6lmer\u201d and the Origin of the Lesser and Greater Mysteries of the Illuminati According to McIlhany, Weishaupt was \u201cinstructed by a mysterious occultist named K\u00f6lmer.\u201d The only problem I have with this statement is that it is not qualified with \u201calleged\u201d or \u201cpurported.\u201d The K\u00f6lmer legend first appeared in Volume III of Abb\u00e9 Augustin Barruel\u2019s tome against Philosophes, Freemasons, the Illuminati and the Jacobins. He related it rather tentatively as a rumour going round, and as a possible way of explaining the ostensibly advanced nature of Weishaupt\u2019s mysteries. \u203a Continue reading\n\nWas Carl Jung\u2019s Ancestor an Illuminatus? Tuesday, February 17th, 2009 | Illuminati Members | 22 Comments by Terry Melanson (17/2/2009) There\u2019s two Illuminati with the last name Jung identified in Hermann Sch\u00fcttler\u2019s Die Mitglieder des Illuminatenordens 1776-1787/93 (Munich: Ars Una 1991): Franz Wilhelm Jung (1757-1833) and Johann Sigmund Jung (1745-1824). The latter, it turns out, was probably the uncle to the famed Swiss psychoanalyst\u2019s grandfather, Carl Gustav Jung (1794-1864). \u203a Continue reading\n\n\u201cLang\u201d or \u201cLanz\u201d: Myths about the \u201cMyths\u201d Saturday, November 15th, 2008 | Illuminati myths | 4 Comments by Terry Melanson (15/11/2008) So, I\u2019m browsing through the results of a keyword-search (targeting blogs) that I had previously saved as an RSS feed in Google Reader - \u201cIlluminati.\u201d Usually the results point to sites that abuse the term as a mere descriptor for an overarching, all-powerful monolithic conspiracy. However, once in a while, I occasionally come across at least an attempt not to knowingly butcher the historical record. The November 12th post at the English section of Illuminaten.org is one such example. But as I started reading \u201cThe Bavarian Illuminati: several myths revealed,\u201d it became quite clear that the post is, in fact - word for word - an abridged re-posting of \u201cA Bavarian Illuminati Primer.\u201d Once I got to the part about Lanz and Lang, I knew for sure. Here\u2019s what Mason Trevor W. McKeown thinks is the myth/truth: As an example of the mythology that surrounds the history of the Illuminati, note that Barruel claimed that Lanz, an Illuminati courier and apostate priest, was struck by lightning, thus revealing Weishaupt\u2019s papers to the authorities, but this does not appear to be substantiated. This error was widely reprinted and enlarged on by subsequent anti-masons whose lack of research and disdain for historical accuracy has lead them to confuse Johann Jakob Lanz (d.1785), a non-Illuminati secular priest in Erding, and friend of Weishaupt, with Franz Georg Lang, a court advisor in Eichst\u00e4tt who was active in the Illuminati under the name Tamerlan. Barruel mistakenly translated \u201cweltpriester\u201d, or secular priest, as apostate priest and subsequent writers such as Webster and Miller have repeated this error. Eckert renamed Weishaupt\u2019s friend as Lanze and had him struck by lightning while carrying dispatches in Silesia. Miller cited Eckert but renamed Lanz as Jacob Lang and placed the lightning strike in Ratisbon. This is a minor detail in the history but it demonstrates the lack of accuracy often displayed by detractors of the Illuminati. As nobody has challenged him on these assertions - not even a German site who should know better - I\u2019ll reiterate and add additional information to what I had written back in August 2005. Mr. McKeown is guilty of the same thing he accuses others of: \u201clack of research and disdain for historical accuracy.\u201d \u203a Continue reading\n\nIlluminati Sightseeing: Karl and St. Germain at Louisenlund Monday, November 10th, 2008 | Illuminati Sightseeing | 2 Comments by Terry Melanson (10/11/2008) The estate of (Illuminatus) Landgrave Karl von Hessen-Kassel (1744-1836) was an occult-masonic initiatory retreat. The world\u2019s foremost expert on the 18th-Century Golden and Rosy Cross, Dr. Christopher McIntosh: The head of the Asiatic Brethren in the 1780s and 1790s was the Landgrave Carl von Hessen-Kassel, one of the most fascinating and influential figures at the time in the world of Masonry, Rosicrucianism and hermetic studies. He not only belonged to innumerable orders and rites, but he was a practicing alchemist and was a friend of the mysterious French alchemist, the Comte de St. Germain, whom he harbored during the last years of St. Germain\u2019s life on his estate Louisenlund in what is now Schleswig-Holstein, which he turned into a great center of Masonic and esoteric activity. The park at Louisenlund (about an hour\u2019s drive northwest of Kiel) was laid out in the form of an initiatic journey that involved the candidate passing through a dense wood finding his way through a labyrinth and encountering various alchemical and allegorical images along the way. In the park was an alchemist\u2019s tower with a laboratory and a room where Masonic rituals were conducted. There was also a pond with a secret grotto concealed behind a waterfall, in which the most solemn rituals were held. Over the years, unfortunately, most of these symbolic features have disappeared. All that remains of the alchemist\u2019s tower, for example, is this Egyptian stone doorway which was moved to a different position, and cemented into the wall of a stable building where it stands completely out of context. Today this property belongs to a private school. \u203a Continue reading", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Pedagogy", "Owl of Minerva", "William XI", "Munich", "Louisenlund", "Illuminaten", "Hermann Sch\u00fcttler", "Antinomianism", "Rue Popincourt", "Christine Schaubs", "Carl Jung", "Saint-Germain", "Sabbatians", "Jacob Frank", "Pyramid", "Rosicrucians", "Hanau", "Royal Treasury", "Strict Observance", "J.
