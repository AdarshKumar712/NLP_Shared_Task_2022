"movies": [], "text": "With our obesity rate at an all time high \u2014 nearly four in 10 Americans are not just overweight, but obese \u2014 the Food and Drug Administration is cracking down on one of our greatest social ills: flavored e-cigarettes in stores that admit minors. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is expected to announce the regulations any day now.\n\nIn the latest episode of the nanny state run amok, the FDA has decided that teen vaping is its villain of the day. It is imposing heavy restrictions on the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, such as a complete ban of sales in non-age-restricted facilities, like gas stations and convenience stores, as well as increased regulations for online sales.\n\nThe cigarette industry must be thrilled. A marked increase in vaping has contributed to the lowest rate of cigarette use among American adults since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began reporting on it in 1965. A quarter of smokers who successfully quit within the year are now vaping instead. Study after study demonstrates that vaping significantly increases the probability of quitting smoking, whereas other methods, like nicotine replacement therapy, do not.\n\nStill, Gottlieb decries e-cigs because they're \"not risk-free\" and there is supposedly an \"epidemic\" of teen use. Well, considering that 1.4 million teenagers have still smoked cigarettes in the last month, I'll take a vaping epidemic over a cigarette one.\n\nAs with most things we put in our bodies, vaping does come with risks. E-cigarettes were specifically designed to wean smokers off of cigarettes, so vaping delivers nicotine. However, Public Health England found that e-cigs are only 5 percent as harmful as actual cigarettes. The research in the U.K. demonstrated that just 1 percent of all vapers picked up a regular vaping habit after never smoking before. Thus, vaping is being consistently used for its intended purpose, with very few outside consequences.\n\nAll pubic health decisions involve trade-offs. If e-cigarettes are helping millions of adults cease a practice with a 50 percent chance of killing them in the long term, that's undoubtedly worth having a tiny minority of teenagers pick up a habit that is unproven and unlikely to do much more harm than most of the American fast food industry has already done. Banning flavored vaping products in convenience stores will also harm low-income Americans trying to quit smoking more than anyone else.\n\nGottleib calls this an \"unfortunate tradeoff.\" And it is. His decision could very well kill people by taking away the single most successful alternative to a habit that murders people en masse.\n\nRepealing net neutrality was never going to kill anyone. Tax cuts were never going to kill anyone. Banning 70 percent of the e-cigarette supply from being sold in the cheapest, most accessible venues, however, could actually kill people.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Health", "Beltway Confidential", "CDC", "FDA", "Smoking", "E Cigarettes", "Scott Gottlieb", "Opinion", "Magazine Home"], "authors": ["Gabjones Bloomberg"], "publish_date": "Fri Nov  9 23:23:46 2018", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "With our obesity rate at an all time high \u2014 nearly four in 10 Americans are not just overweight, but obese \u2014 the Food and Drug Administration is cracking down on one of our greatest social ills: flavored e-cigarettes in stores that admit minors.
