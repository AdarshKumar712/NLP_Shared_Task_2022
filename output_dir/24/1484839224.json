However, after the report came out, indicating no collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, some took their rage up a notch and expressed their violent fantasies for all to see.\n\nHere are some of the worst examples of that rage.\n\n1. Bette Midler openly wished for someone to \u201cshiv\u201d or \u201cstab\u201d Trump.\n\nShe wrote the tweet in reaction to Trump\u2019s surprise visit to the McLean Bible Church in Wolf Trap, Virginia, in June.\n\n\u201cHe actually looks better here! Maybe someone in his camp can gently give him a shiv. I mean, shove,\u201d she wrote in the now-deleted tweet.\n\n2. Months later, the Broadway star praised the man who violently attacked Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) \u2014 an attack that resulted in injuries, including broken ribs and bruised lungs.\n\n\u201cI DO NOT promote violence but\u2026 Rand Paul says the Kurds are being \u2018ingrates\u2019 for taking their frustrations out on US troops. Which is a good reminder for us all to be more grateful for the neighbor who beat the shit out of Rand Paul,\u201d Midler wrote in a now-deleted tweet.\n\n3. Barbra Streisand shared an image depicting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) killing Trump.\n\nThe Grammy-winning singer shared an image of Pelosi impaling Trump with the heel of her shoe.

Kay Ivey being killed in an abortion.\n\nCarrey opted to weigh in on Alabama\u2019s abortion law by posting a graphic image of Ivey, who signed the pro-life Human Life Protection Act, being sucked into a tube.\n\n\u201cI think If you\u2019re going to terminate a pregnancy, it should be done sometime before the fetus becomes Governor of Alabama,\u201d Carrey wrote.\n\nI think If you\u2019re going to terminate a pregnancy, it should be done sometime before the fetus becomes Governor of Alabama. pic.twitter.com/6QgsY2rMz7 \u2014 Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) May 18, 2019\n\nHe also shared an image depicting Pelosi crushing Trump\u2019s testicles.\n\n5. Robert de Niro openly wished to see Trump hit in the face with a \u201cbag of shit.\u201d\n\nThe Irishman actor outlined his fantasy during an appearance on Rumble with Michael Moore in December.\n\n\u201cPigs have dignity. He has no dignity. He is a disgrace to the human race,\u201d de Niro said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see a bag of shit right in his face. Hit him right in the face like that, and let the picture go all over the world,\u201d he continued.\n\n6. Cher wished for Trump to be \u201clocked in a hot cage with dirty water.\u201d\n\nThe pop singer weighed in on the summer controversy on ICE detentions and toed the Democrat Party line, tweeting a flurry of unsubstantiated accusations.\n\nOur President At Work.\n\nSaw Video Of Baby In\n\nCustody.Theres Breakout of Chickenpox,Measles,Children Live outdoors in Texas heat,\n\nBad food,Dirty Water,unsanitary Conditions,Physical,Emotional,\n\nSexual Abuse.\n\ntrumps a psychotic Ass\ud83d\udd73.\n\nWish He Was Locked In Hot Cage,With Dirty Water pic.twitter.com/NhfAozAxxL \u2014 Cher (@cher) June 15, 2019\n\n7.

I got you the traditional gift: a bucket of lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was incredibly frustrating to watch \u2014 filled with legalistic hair-splitting and political ass-covering.
