The National Probation Service has tried and failed to help you.\u201d\n\nBarber then appeared to shake his head at which point Judge Linford stormed out before returning and slamming Barber for \u201cthe most appalling tirade of racial abuse it is possible to imagine\u201d.\n\nAn irritated Judge Linford then jailed Barber for 14 months for all of the offending.\n\nHe was also made subject of a five year criminal behaviour order banning him from being in possession of an open container of alcohol in Cornwall and being found in a state of drunkenness in the county.\n\nKane Powell\n\nA judge told a prolific offender that he had reached the end of the line as he jailed him on his 22 birthday.\n\nKane Powell found himself in the dock at Truro Crown Court for a third time in two years, this time for his role in disorder at an organisation that helps young people facing difficulties in their lives.\n\nPowell, of Higher Fore Street, Redruth , was given non-custodial sentences previously for racially abusing and attacking a taxi driver and then damaging a stranger\u2019s car .\n\nPowell returned to the court to be sentenced after previously admitting using threatening or abusive words or behaviour, putting him in breach of a suspended sentence.\n\nProsecuting the case, Michael Brown said: \u201cOn October 23 at 7pm officers were called to attend Redruth Foyer due to reports of a disturbance involving a number of individuals and the defendant was seen kicking a door.\n\n\u201cHe was told to stay away but two hours later he returned and was again asked to leave. This time he was swearing and spitting and told officers to f*ck off as well as making other threats.\u201d\n\nSentencing Powell, Judge Simon Carr said: \u201cOn November 20 2018 you were sentenced for a range of offences. These offences were serious and involved the possession of a knife, racially aggravated threats of violent and battery.\n\n\u201cOffences like these usually attract a custodial sentence but the court took a chance on you hoping you would address your issues. You would have no doubt been told this was your last chance.\n\n\u201cYour reaction was to breach this order by being drunk and committed criminal damage. In April this year you were given another chance but have now reached the end of the line. Those who breach suspended sentence don\u2019t get repeated chances.\u201d\n\nJudge Carr did concede that Powell has made progress in some respects and that the recent offence was less serious, but proceeded to jail him for four months and give him a \u00a3150 fine.\n\nBrian Parsonage\n\nA former teacher and researcher stabbed his wife of 29 years with such force the knife remained lodged in her arm.\n\nBrian Parsonage exploded in a huge fit of rage on September 30 after a row about money, not long after he had been made redundant.\n\nParsonage, 60, of Commercial Road in Hayle , appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentence after admitting causing grievous bodily harm and possession of a knife.\n\nProsecuting the case, Ed Bailey, said that Parsonage had never laid a finger on his wife until the day in question but had turned to drink after losing his job.\n\nDetailing events, Mr Bailey said: \u201cChristine Parsonage was angered at the defendant for wasting money and when she realised he\u2019d been drinking an argument flared up.\n\n\u201cThe defendant later told police he drank half a bottle of vodka neat and when words were exchange between him and his wife, he went to the kitchen and Mrs Parsonage saw a folding knife in his hands.\n\n\u201cHe came at her with the knife and jabbed at her arm and she instinctively raised her arm to defend herself. Such was the force of the blow that the knife went into the side of the victim\u2019s forearm.\n\n\u201cHe said to her \u2018I hate you, I really hate you, I want to kill you\u2019. The defendant then throttled her and pushed her into the dining room.\n\n\u201cThe knife remained sticking into her arm and after some time Mr Parsonage pulled it out and grabbed her by the throat again.\u201d\n\nMrs Parsonage, afraid for her life, was eventually able to escape and sought refuge at a nearby vets, whereas Mr Parsonage took himself to Hayle Police Station and handed himself in.\n\nThe victim was left scared to return to her own home and now wishes to leave Cornwall completely.\n\nSentencing Parsonage, Judge Simon Carr said: \u201cThe circumstances behind this case are truly sad. You and the victim were married for 29 years and had a daughter together.\n\n\u201cFinances were tight and one way you dealt with that was to drink to excess which you did on this day.\n\n\u201cThere was an argument with your wife over the fact you\u2019d been drinking and you took a knife and stabbed her with sufficient force that the knife penetrated her arm and lodged there.\n\n\u201cYou continued to be verbally abusive, attacking her and holding her against a wall.\n\n\u201cThe effect on your wife has been obvious. She is severely traumatised and was so scared she not only left the house, but now intends to leave Cornwall.\n\n\u201cYou are 60, a man of previous impeccable character and have dedicated your life to education and that\u2019s why I described it as a truly sad case.\u201d\n\nParsonage was sentenced to 18 months in prison and made subject of a restraining order preventing him from contacting his wife.\n\nJoin our Cornwall's Court Insider Facebook group We've set up a dedicated Facebook group for our court and crime content - Cornwall's Court Insider.

You threatened them, saying unless they paid significant amounts of money you\u2019d to go the police, their family or work colleagues.\n\n\u201cYou reiterated these demands with threats of violence, saying you knew their home and work address. You even took on the persona of a police officer.\n\n\u201cThis was a plot of some sophistication and the threats were repeated and persistent.\n\n\u201cBoth men felt embarrassed. One paid \u00a37,500 and the other \u00a36,000 to buy your silence. Each time they paid you came back and demanded money.\u201d\n\nJudge Carr jailed Conway Baker for three years and told him he must compensate the victims for the amounts they paid him.\n\nMarcus McPherson\n\nA \u201cdangerous and violent sexual predator\u201d was given a huge prison sentence after years of criminality against young girls eventually caught up with him.\n\nMarcus McPherson, still only 21, targeted young girls online and violently sexually assaulted two of his victims after eventually persuading them to meet.\n\nMcPherson, of Dunveth Road in Wadebridge , appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentence after admitting sexual assault, assault by penetration, distributing an indecent image of a child, three counts of meeting a child following sexual grooming, engaging in sexual communication with a child and two breaches of a sexual risk order.\n\nOpening the case, Philip Lee told the court how McPherson\u2019s crimes came to light after a lengthy investigation.\n\nMr Lee describing how \u201cfour victims were identified and willing to help police with their investigation\u201d.\n\nMoving onto the offences against the first victim, Mr Lee described how she met the defendant in 2015 when she was 14 and he was 17.\n\nMr Lee described \u201cpersistent and demanding messages\u201d in which he requested sexual chat and photos and also sent pictures of his penis to the girl.\n\nIn November 2015 she went to meet a friend at a bus stop in Lanivet and agreed the defendant could come along. When they were alone McPherson pushed the girl back and tried to unbutton her trousers and zip.\n\nHe then held her head with one hand and continued trying to undress her with the other, saying it was \u2018what happened to people who said no\u2019.\n\nThe second victim, of a similar age to the first, was again bombarded with sexual messages by McPherson and eventually agreed to meet him in Par in 2017.\n\nHe took a train there and they went to the skate park and then into the woods to take shelter from rain.\n\nWhen there he put her arms around her so she couldn\u2019t move and his hand inside her top, touching her breasts.\n\nHe then put his hand inside her underwear and abused her in such a way she was left in pain. When she told McPherson to back off he still persisted saying \u2018let me do it, it\u2019ll feel really nice\u2019.\n\nChillingly, Mr Lee said after the ordeal McPherson continued to message her and blackmailed her into sending him a naked photograph, warning if she didn\u2019t he\u2019d tell everyone what happened. The girl sent him the picture but he then distributed it to others leading to her receiving comments and abuse.\n\nThe third victim, aged 13, was contacted by McPherson when he was 19 and sent thousands of messages, many of a sexual nature that included videos of him masturbating to the point of ejaculation.\n\nThe girl did meet McPherson but only when others were present, meaning no contact offences took place.\n\nThen, in September 2018, McPherson contacted a young girl on Instagram saying he was 16.\n\nMr Lee said: \u201cConversation was normal at first but when it moved from Instagram to Snapchat it became sexual and the defendant sent pictures of his penis and videos of him masturbating.\u201d\n\nWhile the investigation was progressing McPherson was made subject of a sexual risk order which he repeatedly breached by being found with social media apps on his phone. One breach was reported by a girl he knew from school who he contacted and in turn told police as she was aware of his situation.\n\nThe girls McPherson physically abused were said to have suffered physically and emotionally as a result of his offending, going on to have problems with their education and with self-harm.\n\nSentencing McPherson, Judge Simon Carr said: \u201cSuch was the concern of the authorities about your behaviour that in 2018 they obtained a sexual risk order. They are rare and awarded by magistrates even before a criminal offence is proved.\n\n\u201cIt was a result of this investigation and obtaining the order that officers were able to look at your devices and this revealed a catalogue of offending.\n\n\u201cIt started when you were 17 in 2015 and the offending against each of the four victims followed a similar course.\u201d\n\nJudge Carr described how the girls were bombarded with a barrage of messages.\n\nDetailing the attack on the first victim, Judge Carr said he was convinced that McPherson thrived off not just the sexual aspect but the violence he exerted too.\n\nMoving onto the offence against the second victim, Judge Carr said that the manner of the penetration showed he intended to inflict maximum physical pain.\n\nJudge Carr added: \u201cThe effects of what you did were devastating and the victims relive what they experienced on a daily basis. They quite wrongly blame themselves and have self-harmed and found it difficult to form relationships.\n\n\u201cYou are a dangerous and violent sexual predator and I suspect you will be for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nJudge Carr sentenced McPherson to an extended sentence of 14 years, nine years custodial and five on licence. He will only be eligible for parole after two thirds of the custodial element.\n\nHe was also made subject of a sexual harm prevention order and must sign the sex offenders\u2019 register for life.\n\nPhilip Chalker\n\nA man threatened police officers with a knife after they were called following a huge row when his partner found out he was seeing another woman.\n\nPhillip Chalker, 44, was said in court to have a severe dislike of the police and vowed to kill every one of the officers who attended the scene.\n\nChalker, of Colinsey Road in Penzance , appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentence after admitting affray.\n\nProsecuting the case, Philip Lee told the court how in the late afternoon of October 13 three callers contacted police summoning them to the defendant\u2019s address.\n\nMr Lee said: \u201cWhen police arrived they found Deborah (the defendant\u2019s wife), with an injury to her face.\n\n\u201cThe defendant emerged from the front of the house shouting abuse and making threats, saying to police \u2018if you come into the house I\u2019ll kill you\u2019.\n\n\u201cOfficers tried to reason but the defendant continued with the abuse and threats. He then threw something out of the upstairs window and shouted \u2018stay away from my house of I\u2019ll stab you, I\u2019ll cut you up\u2019.\u201d\n\nChalker then ran into the garden with the kitchen knife in hand.\n\nMr Lee added: \u201cHe then shouted at officers \u2018get that taser away, I\u2019ll kill every one of you\u2019. He went back inside and there was the sound of smashing glass. Eventually he came out and did comply with the officers.\u201d\n\nThe court heard how in 2014 Chalker was sentenced for an almost identical set of offending, also occurring at his home and involving the waving of a knife.\n\nSentencing Chalker, Judge Simon Carr said that the ordeal occurred in broad daylight and must have been frightening for those who witnessed it.\n\nHe added that his previous non-custodial sentence for a similar incident did nothing to deter him and that those who threaten police officers with knives can expect nothing but jail.\n\nChalker was jailed for 15 months.\n\nJohn Williams\n\nA pervy pensioner caught by paedophile hunters engaging in internet sex chats with who he believed to be 12 and 13-year-old girls was sent to prison.\n\nJohn Franklyn Williams, 71, of Leskinnick Place in Penzance, was door-knocked by members of the group Hunters 24/7 who had travelled nearly 350 miles to question him after conversations with their decoy profiles.\n\nWilliams went on trial at Truro Crown Court on Monday charged with two counts of attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity and two of attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child charges.\n\nFollowing a short period of deliberation a jury rubbished Williams\u2019 account that he knew all along they were paedophile hunters and was playing along to call them out, convicting him of all four charges.\n\nProsecuting the case, Paul Grumbar said: \u201cOn September 22, 2017, police received a call asking them to attend a property in Penzance.\n\n(Image: Hunters 24/7)\n\n\u201cWhen police arrived they were met by a man wearing a jumper which had Hunters 24/7 written on it.\n\n\u201cThe people at the address were members of a paedophile hunters group who explained to the officers that female adults had been communicating with the defendant over the internet pretending to be young girls and that the defendant engaged with them with sexually explicit messages.\n\n\u201cThey explained that they were filming a live stream of their interactions with the defendant. The defendant was then arrested on suspicion of child grooming offences and taken to the police station.\n\n\u201cThe messages between the defendant and the two decoys was retrieved and it is clear and obvious that he was obtaining sexual gratification from them.\u201d\n\nDuring the trial the jury was then showed the Hunters 24/7 video in which they explain to Williams that they\u2019ve travelled 347 miles to see him and that he was talking to decoys he believed to be real girls aged 12 and 13.\n\nThe hunters describe that Williams told the decoys that he wanted to have sex with them, asking what difference age makes.\n\nHe also nicknamed his penis and the girls\u2019 genitals during chats and asked them questions about their underwear, urging them to send him pictures and videos.\n\nJudge Simon Carr jailed Williams for 21 months.\n\nYou can view the full sting on Williams here by accessing the Facebook page and then searching his name on the right hand side search function.\n\nDale Laidlaw\n\n\n\nPolice have welcomed a sentence handed down to a prolific shoplifter and burglar saying it acts as reassurance to the public.\n\nDale Laidlaw, 30, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison at Truro Crown Court for a series of burglaries and thefts across Cornwall .\n\nLaidlaw, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to three counts of commercial and four counts of residential burglaries.\n\nA further 22 offences that hadn\u2019t yet reached the crown court were taken into consideration by Judge Simon Carr as he passed sentence after being admitted by Laidlaw.\n\nInvestigating officers DC David Squire welcomed the sentence.\n\nHe said: \u201cLaidlaw is a prolific offender, carrying out many of his burglaries at residential addresses across Bodmin , stealing money, jewellery, electronic items and much more.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased with the sentence outcome and hope this reassures the public that police do take a proactive stance on these types of offences.\n\n\u201cWe work tirelessly to ensure that, where possible, justice is served.\n\n\u201cI would like to acknowledge the good police work carried out by CID, Neighbourhood and Response teams and Scenes of Crime officers in bringing this person to justice.\n\n\u201cWe would like to thank the public who contacted us following our previous appeals for information on social media. Such information proved vital in this person\u2019s conviction.\u201d\n\nJake Campbell\n\nA notorious thug had six months added to his sentence for another unprovoked episode of violence.\n\nThere was jubilation in the Bodmin area in October when Jacob Campbell, 26, was finally put behind bars .\n\nIn August prolific criminal Jake Campbell was given four months to save himself from prison when sentenced for headbutting, choking and punching Jacob Comertoglu as he made his way through Bodmin to see the town\u2019s Christmas lights last year.\n\nCampbell got his suspended jail sentence deferred by the judge after he launched a ferocious beating that left his 19-year-old victim\u2019s face swollen and bruised. A picture of Jacob Comertoglu\u2019s injuries was shared by his mother, causing outrage across Cornwall.\n\nAfter calls from the victim\u2019s mum and others for action, Campbell, 26, was eventually arrested and admitted a charge of assault when he appeared at Bodmin Magistrates\u2019 Court .\n\nPassing sentence at Truro Crown Court , Judge Robert Linford told Campbell, of Wallace Road in Bodmin , that he\u2019d be given one final throw of the dice, deferring sentence until December.\n\nCampbell was told that if he kept out of trouble, saved money towards compensation and kept his appointments he\u2019d avoid a prison sentence. However it took him less than three weeks to blow the chance.\n\nHe found himself back in the dock for an offence of being drunk and disorderly outside The White Hart Inn.\n\nJudge Linford jailed Campbell for 14 months to take into account a wounding suspended sentence and the common assault.\n\nThen, on December 19 he was back before Judge Linford, this time after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\n\nProsecuting the case, Althea Brooks said: \u201cOn October 20 this year at about 9:15pm Sean Flynn was walking from his parents\u2019 house with his partner Donna Martin.\n\n\u201cThey were walking past the entrance to McColl\u2019s when a man asked to borrow ID to buy alcohol. Mr Flynn said no and kept walking but the man continued to ask.\n\n\u201cHe became agitated and hostile and pinned Mr Flynn to the wall. It was at this point the man was joined by the defendant and together they took him to the floor and kicked him numerous times in the head and stomach with one witness hearing the impact.\u201d\n\nCampbell was also aggressive to officers on arrest and Mr Flynn was left with numerous injuries including memory loss which still affect his sleep and work.\n\nSentencing Campbell yet again, Judge Linford said: \u201cI remember you very well. You were a person I took a chance on and you threw it back in my face.\n\n\u201cThis offence is another offence of violence and you launched an unprovoked attack on someone doing nothing wrong at all. It was appalling and outrageous.\u201d\n\nCampbell was given a new sentence of six months to be served on consecutively to the sentence he is already serving ensuring he will remain behind bars even longer.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Truro Crown Court", "Courts", "Crime", "Facebook", "The Co-operative", "Penzance", "Redruth", "Hayle", "Education", "Employment"], "tags": [], "authors":
