James said he only decided three days before the big night that he would have a party at all, which his wife Savannah helped assemble on the short turnaround. It wasn\u2019t just a birthday, but a turning of the page on the year as well.\n\n\u201cI was able to kill two birds with one stone, get my teammates there, coaching staff, my family, my friends, people that\u2019s been around for quite a while and we had a heck of a time,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it was another opportunity for us to bond, which we did. And if it brings us closer, then fantastic. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about for me, bringing us closer to family as possible.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers ended 2019 pretty tight-knit, with a strong body of work behind them. Leading the Western Conference standings and finishing a challenging December slate at 9-5, some of their hardest work is behind them even though the bulk of the schedule remains.\n\nThe year wrapped on an upbeat note with wins over the Portland Trail Blazers and Dallas Mavericks. After that second victory, Coach Frank Vogel had a chance to look at the footage of his team holding the No. 1 offense in the NBA to just 95 points \u2013 to his surprise, he saw some opportunities where his defense (104.8 defensive rating, No. 7 in the NBA) could be even better.\n\nThat\u2019s the Lakers\u2019 2019 resolution: They\u2019re still looking for the perfect performance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just reason for optimism that we still have a long way to go and a lot of room for improvement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting what we can be.\u201d\n\nA big part of that has been success against the teams they are supposed to beat: The Lakers are 17-0 against teams under .500 this season. They\u2019ll have an opportunity to extend that perfection with upcoming home games against Phoenix, New Orleans, Detroit and New York.\n\nThe Lakers warmed to the challenge of their tough schedule last month, playing a host of teams bound for the playoffs. The concern, Vogel acknowledged, is that over a third of the way in against less-than-stellar competition, complacency can sneak in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different sort of stretch right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we begin to enter the dog days of the NBA season, which is like now until All-Star break where it gets a little monotonous and there\u2019s a little bit of a grind and hopefully we can get through that stretch. And then once All-Star break hits, you\u2019re in the home stretch after that.\u201d\n\nOne of the factors the Lakers feel is in their favor is chemistry. Multiple players have cited the 1-through-15 chemistry on the roster as a strength, and James\u2019 birthday party was the latest event where the Lakers have largely shown up off the court as a group.\n\nJames pointed to his youth league days as a model: When he was a young player, he and his teammates would go to parks or malls and play video games together.\n\n\u201cNot only did it influence the way I play on the court, having an effect on how I play today, it also had an influence of how I grew up with my friends, too, and having that brotherhood,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you know anything about my childhood, the guys that I grew up playing ball are still around, they\u2019re still like my best friends.\u201d\n\nThe same concept is important to his NBA teams, James said, which is among the reasons everyone was invited. The feeling of the Lakers is that off-court chemistry will help form on-court bonds that can help them in competitive games.\n\nIt also leads to some nice post-party texts.\n\n\u201cThe best thing about it is that my teammates said how much of a time they had,\u201d he said. \u201cMy family and my friends had a heck of a time. Got a lot of messages this morning saying how much fun it was, how much love was in the air. So that\u2019s what makes it cool for me. The people around me had a good time.\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 LeBron: \"We ended 2019 in a good position to continue to get better, and play better basketball in January than we did in December.\u201d pic.twitter.com/CZnJC3MsC6 \u2014 Los Angeles Lakers (@Lakers) January 1, 2020", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Health", "Jobs", "Long Beach State sports", "Corrections", "Investigative Reporting"], "authors": ["Kyle Goon"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/long-beach-press-telegram-icon.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"application-name": "presstelegram", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "wp-parsely_version": "1.14", "fb": {"pages": 45134780748}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "LeBron James, Lakers ring in 2020 after strong start to season", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/lebron-james-lakers-ring-in-2020-after-strong-start-to-season", "description": "Still sitting atop the Western Conference standings after a challenging December slate, some of the Lakers\u2019 hardest work is behind them, though they\u2019re still in search of perfecting the\u2026", "site_name": "Press Telegram", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/imageedit_8_83440455-16x9-1-1.jpg?w=1024&h=579", "width": 1024, "height": 579}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T01:51:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T01:52:34+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "LeBron James, Lakers ring in 2020 after strong start to season"}, "image": "https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/imageedit_8_83440455-16x9-1-1.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/long-beach-press-telegram-icon.png?w=37"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.ocregister.com/lebron-james-lakers-ring-in-2020-after-strong-start-to-season"}
