The new baby\u2019s name has not yet been decided upon, pending discussions with her husband, Jude.\n\nThe proud mom was due to give birth on Dec. 31, so the little bundle of joy in the Duperval household in Stamford was just about right on time. Duperval started having contractions around midnight, so it was time to get to the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt happened quickly, but giving birth is never easy,\u201d the mother said.\n\nAs she snuggled with her newborn, Duperval said she was feeling a range of emotions: \u201cI\u2019m tired and excited, at the same time.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t eat cake, so there were no candles to blow out. But she said had a great birthday present for herself. \u201cI have my little one right beside me, it\u2019s great,\u201d Duperval said.\n\nThe little newborn came in at healthy weight, just under 8 pounds. She was sleeping comfortably at the hospital Wednesday afternoon and had a healthy glow. Her three brothers were all excited and happy about the new addition.\n\nThe first baby born in 2020 in the state may well have come into the world at 12:04 a.m. Wednesday at Griffin Hospital in Derby. Arabella was born to Dave and Taylor Venice of Woodbridge, weighing 8 pounds, 6 ounces and measuring 20.5 inches long.\n\nThe first baby born of the new year at Greenwich Hospital arrived at 12:50 a.m. Wednesday, but the family declined an interview request.\n\nThe first baby of the year born at Yale New Haven Hospital arrived soon thereafter, at 12:56 a.m. He was named Iziah by his parents, Heather R. and Tianna R. of New Haven, according to hospital spokesman Mark D\u2019Antonio.\n\n\u201cIziah weighed in at 7 pounds, 5 ounces and is the couple\u2019s first child. According to the family, Iziah is the first same sex, biracial baby of 2020,\u201d D\u2019Antonio said in a release. \u201cThe family is doing well.\u201d\n\nIn Norwalk, the first baby of the year arrived at 11:30 a.m., according to Amy Forni, public relations manager for Nuvance Health.\n\nBen Lambert contributed to this story.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "ispremium": 0, "dc.date": "2020-01-01T21:00:00Z", "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T21:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T21:44:59Z", "opinion": "false"}, "SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "news_keywords": "Bercy Duperval, Jude, Mark D'Antonio, Amy Forni, Iziah, Heather R., Tianna R., Ben Lambert, Dave, Arabella, Stamford Hospital, Stamford, Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Norwalk, Griffin Hospital, Greenwich Hospital, Derby, Woodbridge, Greenwich Time, Stamford Advocate, Taylor Venice, CT Insider, Nuvance Health", "nlpOrganization": "Greenwich Time, Stamford Advocate, Taylor Venice", "nlpPerson": "Bercy Duperval, Jude, Mark D'Antonio, Amy Forni, Iziah, Heather R., Tianna R., Ben Lambert, Dave, Arabella", "nlpLocation": "Stamford Hospital, Stamford, Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Norwalk, Griffin Hospital, Greenwich Hospital, Derby, Woodbridge", "nlpOther": "CT Insider, Nuvance Health", "nlpCategories": "%2FPeople+%26+Society%2FFamily+%26+Relationships%2FFamily,%2FHealth%2FReproductive+Health,%2FHealth%2FWomen%27s+Health", "og": {"title": "First baby of the year in Stamford makes her arrival on mom\u2019s birthday", "description": "Bercy Duperval gets a perfect birthday present - a new daughter to join her three sons.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/local/article/First-baby-of-the-year-in-Stamford-makes-her-14943637.php", "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/07/63/46/18823604/13/rawImage.jpg", "site_name": "StamfordAdvocate"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@StamAdvocate", "creator": "@robertmarchant2"}, "fb": {"admins": 100006394927810, "app_id": 612318522124663, "pages": "105702905593,307851324523,12852567813,480760515417232,288240529145,316774245761,984197758297116,7457442370,207033189701,207346283795,222959748728,207042068180,72983690774,339413234035,343689323559,345828366626,234821559861394,335699426867,10150105039485602,338983127562,364516539001,337922332042,115637335153191,372011535931,333376634908,127590790608884,141923885872653,655037391286291,320774811368833,1740489152861748,469700473093040,386754203367,556449374478585,340999853450,350771491032,1120648627959218,342017778245,338463361591,138772706196968,1641688532739111,326312697536,353120110016,343366744658,335009494554,347261603104,350924013892,257724773860,361203926417,367174215398,284154645394,334501182354,350279743224,154340691263654,147848678611852,361381078011,362831597677,10150095255780118"}, "msvalidate.01": "9451CA04ABC9D1D5C6419C73B4C4F7B7"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/local/article/First-baby-of-the-year-in-Stamford-makes-her-14943637.php"}
