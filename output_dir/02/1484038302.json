But beyond the entertainment, the celebration featured more than 40 food trucks serving up tasty eats for a crowd expected to be about 50,000.\n\nThe main rule for the night? No alcohol was allowed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a low-key event, a mellow crowd,\u201d Paul Parkhurst, an attendee, said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about the effects of people drinking and driving. I don\u2019t have to worry about drinking and getting a ride back anywhere, so that\u2019s why I like this event better.\u201d\n\nIn the past Parkhurst has had to work the event, but said he was looking forward to enjoying it.\n\n\u201cI would say from the beginning, L.A. has really embraced this event,\u201d Julia Diamond, Grand Park director, said. \u201cIn our very first year, we had 25,000 people who came, which was, I will say, a surprise for everyone. We\u2019ve seen it grow year after year, so now we\u2019re expecting this year about 50,000-plus, and what we\u2019re saying is people coming back. They\u2019re making this their New Year\u2019s.\u201d\n\nFor those still making their way down to the celebration, a reminder that liquids are not allowed, unless its a juice box for children.\n\nThe festivities were scheduled to last until 1 a.m.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["20/20", "grand park", "grand park and the music center\u2019s new year\u2019s eve l.a.", "new year"], "tags": ["New Year", "20/20", "Grand Park and the Music Center\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve L.A.", "Grand Park"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Tens of thousands of people were expected to usher in 2020 in downtown Los Angeles, gathering at Grand Park for the city's biggest free music and dance party.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/06/cropped-la-favicon-512.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "%tags%", "keywords": "20/20, grand park, grand park and the music center\u2019s new year\u2019s eve l.a., new year", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "fb": {"pages": 57972945858}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"title": "Thousands Ring In 2020 At Grand Park In Downtown Los Angeles", "image": {"identifier": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/Grand-Park.jpg?w=1280", "secure_url": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/Grand-Park.jpg?w=1280", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Tens of thousands of people were expected to usher in 2020 in downtown Los Angeles, gathering at Grand Park for the city's biggest free music and dance party.", "type": "article", "url": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/12/31/los-angeles-prepares-to-ring-in-2020-at-grand-park/"}, "article": {"published_time": "2019-12-31T21:00:06+00:00", "suggested-social-copy": "Tens of thousands of people were expected to usher in 2020 in downtown Los Angeles, gathering at Grand Park for the city's biggest free music and dance party.", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/Grand-Park.jpg?w=1280", "title": "Thousands Ring In 2020 At Grand Park In Downtown Los Angeles", "description": "Tens of thousands of people were expected to usher in 2020 in downtown Los Angeles, gathering at Grand Park for the city's biggest free music and dance party.", "site": "CBSLA"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/06/cropped-la-favicon-512.png?w=270", "description": "Tens of thousands of people were expected to usher in 2020 in downtown Los Angeles, gathering at Grand Park for the city's biggest free music and dance party."}, "canonical_link": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/12/31/los-angeles-prepares-to-ring-in-2020-at-grand-park/"}
