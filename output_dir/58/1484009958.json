You never thought it will happen but I declare over your head that Jehovah will meet you at the point of your needs.\"\n\nApostle Dr. Ernest Adulai, the Senior Pastor of the Revival Assemblies of God Church, said any Christian that had the belief that they were destined for greatness and success would surely achieve them since nothing including death could stop them.\n\n\"As we start another decade, I want to tell you that special things happen in the beginning of decades. I declare 2020 will be your year full of blessings,\" he said.\n\nApostle Dr. Adulai called on the youth to live worthy lives and eschew all forms of social vices such as stealing.\n\nPrayers were said for Ghana, the Presidency, Ministers of State, Institutions, and the citizenry.\n\nAt the stroke of midnight January 1, 2020, people shouted and bells rang with fireworks to announce the break of a new dawn as congregants were heard wishing one another \"fe yeye na m\u00ec\" (Happy New Year).\n\nKiki's Court, Obama Gardens, Malaysia Pub and Ghana @ 50, major drinking spots in the town were almost empty as managers of Kiki's Court shut services with the hope that the morning of the day would be 'better'.\n\nThere was police patrol in town while officers were stationed at some churches with most busy streets blocked to manage motor and vehicular traffic.\n\nGNA", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["{keywords}"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "{description}", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://ghananewsagency.org/favicon.gif", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive", "description": "{description}", "keywords": "{keywords}", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-translate-customization": "ed4e15358d21bc05-cdb86c6b2a6a0bd0-gdff7727f8d39ef2a-13", "fb": {"pages": 547130695310674, "admins": 539319879}, "og": {"type": "article", "author": "Ghana News Agency", "title": "Christians in Hohoe hold watch night services to usher in 2020", "url": "https://ghananewsagency.org/social/christians-in-hohoe-hold-watch-night-services-to-usher-in-2020-162070", "image": "https://ghananewsagency.org/assets/images/social-watch-nights.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@FreshNews_Ghana", "description": "news, story, article", "creator": "@GHANANEWSAGENCY"}}, "canonical_link": "https://ghananewsagency.org/social/christians-in-hohoe-hold-watch-night-services-to-usher-in-2020-162070"}
