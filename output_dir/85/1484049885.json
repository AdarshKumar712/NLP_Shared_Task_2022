E-cigarette pods formulated to taste like tobacco or menthol would still be allowed.\n\nThe Journal also reported that tank-based vaping systems, which are less popular among teenagers, would still allow users to custom-mix flavors. The Journal report cited anonymous \u201cpeople familiar with the matter.\u201d\n\nIn September, Trump and his top health officials said they would soon sweep virtually all flavored e-cigarettes from the market because of their appeal to young children and teens. But that effort stalled after vaping lobbyists pushed back and White House advisers told Trump the ban could cost him votes with adults who vape.\n\nBeginning in May, All e-cigarettes will need to undergo FDA review. Only those that can demonstrate a benefit for U.S. public health will be permitted to stay on the market.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump suggested a ban of flavored e-cigarettes might be temporary. \u201cHopefully, if everything\u2019s safe, they\u2019re going to be going very quickly back onto the market,\u201d he told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where he was hosting a New Year\u2019s Eve party.\n\n\u201cPeople have died from this, they died from vaping,\u201d the Republican president said. \u201cWe think we understand why. But we\u2019re doing a very exhaustive examination and hopefully everything will be back on the market very, very shortly.\u201d\n\nBut the FDA had already announced that, starting in May, all e-cigarettes will need to undergo a review. And only those that can demonstrate a benefit for U.S. public health will be permitted to stay on the market.\n\nIn Florida, Trump added: \u201cLook, vaping can be good from the standpoint \u2014 you look at the e-cigarettes, you stop smoking. If you can stop smoking, that\u2019s a big advantage. So, we think we\u2019re going to get it back on the market very, very quickly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Associated Press"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 11:25:43 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Donald Trump says the federal government will soon announce a new strategy to tackle underage vaping, promising, \u201cWe\u2019re going to protect our families, we\u2019re going to protect our children, and we\u2019re going to protect the industry.\u201d Trump was vague about what the plan would entail", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://triblive.com/wp-content/themes/TribLIVE/assets/visuals/images/icons/head/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "website", "site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "title": "Trump suggests some flavored vapes may be pulled from market", "url": "https://triblive.com/news/world/trump-suggests-some-flavored-vapes-may-be-pulled-from-market/", "image": "https://triblive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2134366_web1_2134366-d7e4c23ae71f49bea3d89b0c19b3ee6c.jpg", "description": "PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Donald Trump says the federal government will soon announce a new strategy to tackle underage vaping, promising, \u201cWe\u2019re going to protect our families, we\u2019re going to protect our children, and we\u2019re going to protect the industry.\u201d Trump was vague about what the plan would entail", "updated_time": "2020-01-01T11:25:43-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T11:25:43-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T11:25:43-05:00", "mainsection": "News", "subsection": "World", "category": "News", "subcategory": "World", "title": "Trump suggests some flavored vapes may be pulled from market", "author": "Associated Press", "publishedtoweb": "2020-01-01T11:25:43-05:00"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "description": "PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Donald Trump says the federal government will soon announce a new strategy to tackle underage vaping, promising, \u201cWe\u2019re going to protect our families, we\u2019re going to protect our children, and we\u2019re going to protect the industry.\u201d Trump was vague about what the plan would entail", "author": "Associated Press", "pagetype": "story", "custom meta field": "News, Politics Election, U.S./World", "headline": "Trump suggests some flavored vapes may be pulled from market", "docauthor": "Associated Press", "pubdate": "2020-01-01T11:25:43-05:00", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://triblive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2134366_web1_2134366-d7e4c23ae71f49bea3d89b0c19b3ee6c.jpg", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "creator": "@triblive", "title": "Trump suggests some flavored vapes may be pulled from market", "description": "PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Donald Trump says the federal government will soon announce a new strategy to tackle underage vaping, promising, \u201cWe\u2019re going to protect our families, we\u2019re going to protect our children, and we\u2019re going to protect the industry.\u201d Trump was vague about what the plan would entail", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"iphone": 328217517, "ipad": 328217517}, "url": {"iphone": "tribbird://", "ipad": "tribbird://"}}}}, "canonical_link": "https://triblive.com/news/world/trump-suggests-some-flavored-vapes-may-be-pulled-from-market/"}
