They can reduce temperatures on streets and in cities by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas concrete and asphalt are heat-trapping;\n\n\u2022 Trees help us conserve energy by reducing the need for the use of air conditioning in houses where trees are present nearby;\n\n\u2022 Trees conserve water by reducing evaporation of it by heat and by ensuring that water loss is minimized by absorbing rainfall through their root systems instead of losing it to runoff;\n\n\u2022 Trees act like sponges and help remove pollutants from rainfall water before it reaches storm drains and bodies of water;\n\n\u2022 Trees help reduce soil erosion and landslides with their root systems and reduce flood potential;\n\n\u2022 Trees can reduce exposure to UVB rays from the sun by up to 50 per cent;\n\n\u2022 Neighbourhoods and homes that are barren have been shown to have a greater incidence of violence in and out of the home than their greener counterparts. Trees and landscaping help to reduce the level of fear;\n\n\u2022 Trees provide a home and a habitat for wildlife. Imagine how challenging it has become for bird life to find appropriate nesting sites to help raise the next generation of their species. Birds are being squeezed out of many communities due to a complete lack of nest-building sites;\n\n\u2022 The beauty of a well-planted property and its surrounding street and neighbourhood can raise property values by as much as 15 per cent;\n\n\u2022 Studies show that the more trees and landscaping a business district has, the more business will flow in.\n\n\u2022 A tree-lined street will also slow traffic \u2013 enough to allow the drivers to look at the storefronts instead of whizzing by.\n\nThese are just some of the many reasons for us to preserve trees and make them a large part of our communities, instead of clear-cutting huge swaths of them for what is promoted as \u2018affordable housing\u2019 for our growing communities and instead becomes yet another money-maker for a developer who cares little about the frivolous topic of tree preservation in the community.\n\nTrees have communities, too, and communicate with each other to help them preserve and care for themselves through transportation of enzymes through their root systems.\n\nIf trees could talk, they would tell us that by removing them in the vast numbers that we continue to do, they are no longer able to help protect us from the future that awaits us in a world bereft of trees.\n\nWake up, community councils, and smell the coffee before the only thing we will be smelling is the slow burn of our communities from the ravages of our rapidly overheated climate. Stop the carnage before Mother Nature turns her back on us completely.\n\nMichael King, White Rock", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["BC Major Midget League", "White Rock Tritons", "Valley West Hawks", "BCHL", "Surrey Eagles", "Celebrations of Life", "BC Premier Baseball League"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 06:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Editor:", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://ow0hs2zhmkp2497op3xhvxsa-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/BlackPress/assets/images/icons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "gpsid": 19831656, "generator": "AMP for WP 0.9.98.2", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Peace Arch News", "url": "https://www.peacearchnews.com/opinion/letters-value-of-trees-cannot-be-overstated/", "title": "LETTERS: Value of trees cannot be overstated - Peace Arch News", "description": "Editor:", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.peacearchnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19831656_web1_trees1-1024x683.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 683}, "secure_url": "https://www.peacearchnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19831656_web1_trees1-1024x683.jpg"}, "description": "Editor:", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2020-01-01T06:00:00-08:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "LETTERS: Value of trees cannot be overstated - Peace Arch News", "description": "Editor:", "image": "https://www.peacearchnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19831656_web1_trees1-1024x683.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 307451845947866}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.peacearchnews.com/opinion/letters-value-of-trees-cannot-be-overstated/"}
