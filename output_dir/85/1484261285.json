The first time parents hold the title of having the first baby of 2020 in Erie.\n\nIt all started at 5:30 p.m. on December 31, 2019 when Matson-Warner\u2019s water broke.\n\n\u201cIt was a very long day, but a very nice surprise. We were not expecting to have a baby this soon,\u201d said Destiny Matson-Warner.\n\nJust like that, when the clock struck 2:12 a.m., the little guy, John Ronald Matson-Warner, was born.\n\nJohn Ronald was originally due January 22. Safe to say he was a surprise. Another surprise was the gender.\n\n\u201cI was shocked, because I thought it was going to be a girl,\u201d said Destiny.\n\n\u201cI thought it was going to be a boy,\u201d said John Matson-Warner, Dad.\n\nBoth mom and dad say they look forward to the adventures that are ahead of them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty excited. He\u2019s been easy so far, he\u2019s cute,\u201d said John.\n\nThere was definitely no shortage of babies at Hamot with two more babies besides John being born, and two others born at Saint Vincent Hospital.\n\nThe second baby born in the new year was at 10:34 a.m. at Saint Vincent Hospital. Helping to bring baby Elisha into the world was RN nurse Jill O\u2019Conner.\n\n\u201cI love doing it. It is one of my favorite days of the year. The new year represents a fresh start for everybody. What is fresher than a new baby?\u201d said Jill O\u2019Conner, RN, Labor and Delivery, Saint Vincent Hospital.\n\nAs for which is a better day to deliver a baby, Christmas or New Year\u2019s Day, O\u2019Conner says both are just as magical.\n\nBoth Hamot and Saint Vincent give New Year\u2019s Day babies little hats to wear.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["first babies of 2020"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Samiar Nefzi", "Chelsey Withers"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 23:57:39 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Several families are kicking off the new year from the hospital, but for a great reason\u2014the birth of their child.
