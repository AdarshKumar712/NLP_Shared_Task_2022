JB Pritzker has issued more than 11,000 pardons for people convicted of misdemeanor marijuana cases, in the first step toward clearing the records of hundreds of thousands of low-level pot convictions, a day before the state legalizes cannabis in 2020.\n\n\u201cThese 11,017 misdemeanor convictions represent individuals who have carried around with them a stain on their records for possessing less than 30 grams of cannabis; a stain that has very often prevented them from obtaining housing, or jobs, or benefits. Today, we lift the burden on the first 11,000,\u201d Pritzker said Monday at Trinity United Church of Christ.\n\nThe move is just the first wave toward clearing more than 700,000 low-level pot convictions in the coming months and years, as Illinois officially legalizes marijuana beginning Wednesday.\n\nIllinois residents who are at least 21 years old may possess up to 30 grams of marijuana when the new law begins on Jan. 1.\n\nPritzker promised people with low-level pot convictions will get a new lease on life as marijuana becomes legal. The governor said marijuana convictions disproportionately affected the African American and Hispanic communities for decades. This step was one way to right that wrong.\n\nThe process for expunging an estimated 700,000 marijuana convictions won\u2019t be simple, or fast, however. The state law legalizing marijuana provides for up to five years to clear convictions.\n\nThe automatic expungement does not happen when recreational marijuana is legalized on Wednesday. It happens when when cases are identified and processed \u2013 and the State of Illinois and Cook County are each going about that differently.\n\nEach start with The Illinois State Police, with officers reviewing databases for eligible cases individually.\n\nIn the end, State Police and local law enforcement will be responsible for dedicating personnel to wiping away the records.\n\nAn \u201cautomatic\u201d expungement doesn\u2019t have to be approved until January 2021 if it dates as far back as 2013.\n\nCook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s office moved to expunge more than 1,000 low-level, non-violent pot convictions in Cook County earlier this month. Ultimately, her office expects to clear tens of thousands \u2013 if not hundreds of thousands \u2013 of marijuana convictions.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["local", "news", "seen on cbs 2", "syndicated local", "watch + listen", "chicago news", "jb pritzker", "local tv", "marijuana convictions", "pardons", "recreational marijuana"], "tags": ["Pardons", "Recreational Marijuana", "Marijuana Convictions", "JB Pritzker", "Local TV", "Investigative", "Chicago News"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Gov.
