Starting Jan. 1, the highway patrol joined other law-enforcement agencies in issuing tickets, instead of warnings, to motorists stopped for texting while driving.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to always be education going on, however now it\u2019s going to be enforcement time,\u201d Lt. Derrick Rahming of the highway patrol said. \u201cWe never want anyone to learn the hard way, so we gave everyone six months to learn about this law. But, now come Jan. 1, it\u2019s a primary offense and we are going to start issuing citations.\u201d\n\nThe new year also will usher in other changes passed during the spring legislative session, including part of a tax package that required a reduction in a tax that businesses pay on commercial leases.\n\nAs with the tax package, the bulk of the texting-while-driving law went into place July 1.\n\nFlorida in recent years has banned texting while driving, but it had been enforced as a \u201csecondary\u201d offense \u2014 meaning motorists could only be cited for texting if they were stopped for other reasons such as speeding. But the new law (HB 107) made it a \u201cprimary\u201d offense, allowing police to pull over motorists for texting behind the wheel.\n\nThe law also bars motorists from talking on cellphones in school and work zones, unless the motorists use \u201chandsfree\u201d electronic devices.\n\nLaw-enforcement agencies such as the highway patrol phased in enforcement of the law, with troopers issuing warnings to motorists before planning to start writing citations in 2020.\n\nTickets issued for a first offense carry a $30 fine plus court costs, which could reach $108.16. The fine jumps to $60 \u2014 $158.18 with court costs \u2014 for a second violation within five years.\n\nBecause of concerns the law could lead to racial profiling, officers are required to record the race and ethnicity of every violator.\n\nHighway patrol troopers have issued about 800 warnings, which Lt. Rahming said shouldn\u2019t be considered low.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s right around where it needs to be,\u201d Lt. Rahming said. \u201cThroughout the state, we\u2019ve had 1,151 citations issued (by all law enforcement) since the law started in July.\u201d\n\nLt. Rahming said people putting down their phones while driving will make the roads safer.\n\n\u201cWhen you are sitting inside of a patrol car, you are going to see a lot of things. One of the things you will see is someone distracted in their vehicle,\u201d Lt. Rahming said. \u201cThe number one thing we want to do is make sure everyone has their mind on driving and they are doing everything they need to, to make sure they are focused on driving.\u201d\n\nAmong other changes taking effect Jan. 1:\n\n\u00a6 As part of an $87 million tax relief package (HB 7123), a sales-tax rate on commercial leases will be trimmed from 5.7 percent to 5.5 percent. The reduction is expected produce a $30.8 million cut in state and local taxes in the remaining six months of the fiscal year. Over a full year, the savings are estimated at $64.5 million.\n\n\u00a6 A new law (HB 831) requires health care practitioners to transmit prescriptions electronically, with certain exceptions.\n\n\u00a6 A new law (HB 409), allows remote, online notarization of documents.\n\n\u00a6 A new law (HB 427), establishes the Honor and Remember Flag, which will honor members of the military who have died in the line of duty. The law authorizes the flag to be flown at state buildings and by local governments on Veterans Day, Gold Star Mother\u2019s Day or any day when a member of the military from Florida dies in the line of duty. \u00a6", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["top news"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Florida Weekly Staff", "Jim Turner", "News Service Of Florida"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 06:02:30 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "\"Enforcement time\" has come for motorists caught texting and driving by Florida Highway Patrol troopers.
