While the macroeconomic numbers may be favourable, the impact on the majority of people may not necessarily follow as the gap between the haves and have nots continues to widen.\n\n\u201cThe pot as a whole is getting bigger, but fewer and fewer people are getting a decent share. Even when I say New Providence will have a good inning, I\u2019m talking in macroeconomic terms which may not necessarily translate to the overwhelming majority of the population a year from now feeling any better off. The majority will not feel any better off.\u201d\n\nSir Franklyn said the government seemed to have forgotten the growing income inequality, and widening gap between rich and lower income Bahamians, given that none of its public statements or speeches had ever addressed the issue.\n\n\u201cI have yet to hear any government minister make any statement that they see this as an issue,\u201d he added. \u201cI cannot think of any statement a cabinet minister has made which specifically addresses the imbalance between the haves and the have nots as a key public policy issue. This is not even on the radar of the authorities.\u201d\n\nConcerns over income inequality, and a widening gap between rich and poor stemming from a middle class \u2018squeeze\u2019, have been voiced periodically ever since the 2008-2009 recession. Real per capita incomes took 10 years to recover to their pre-recession levels, hitting this mark only in 2017.\n\nSir Franklyn, meanwhile, suggested that K Peter Turnquest, deputy prime minister, may come under pressure from his Cabinet colleagues to loosen spending and other fiscal controls in a bid to shore up the Government\u2019s popularity just over half-way through its term in office.\n\nAsked about the Government\u2019s ability to avoid a further sovereign credit rating downgrade post-Dorian, he replied: \u201cMinster Turnquest, he is really giving it a good shot. He is trying. I\u2019m sure he will do his personal best to try and avoid it.\n\n\u201cI get the sense that there\u2019s some restlessness within the Cabinet. They sense the popularity of the Government is not trending in a favourable direction, so they will push the minister of finance to do things which may not be consistent with avoiding that downgrade. I think a lot truly depends on the extent to which the Minister of Finance can be strong in the face of pressure from his own Cabinet colleagues.\u201d\n\nThe Government previously revealed it will have to seek Parliamentary approval to borrow an extra $508m to finance post-Hurricane Dorian reconstruction, blowing out its projected 2019-2020 fiscal deficit to $677.5m from the initially projected $137m.\n\nIts Fiscal Strategy Report also shows it borrowing a further $499m in 2020-2021, and $301.2m in 2021-2022, meaning that the Minnis administration is forecasting it will need to borrow some $1.479bn over its final three years in office and taking the national debt to nearly $9.5bn.\n\nThe likes of Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) and Moody\u2019s have effectively taken a wait-and-see approach, though, seemingly preferring to assess how The Bahamas manages the post-Dorian fall-out and whether it can restrain any unnecessary spending before moving to again narrow the deficit.\n\nSir Franklyn yesterday urged Mr Turnquest to follow \u201cthe Paul Adderley model\u201d and \u201cput country before party\u201d in how he handles the public finances in the aftermath of the Category Five storm.\n\nHe added that it was \u201clikely to be significant\u201d that Mr Turnquest was finance minister, rather than the Prime Minister, which was the structure employed by all Dr Hubert Minnis\u2019 predecessors.\n\n\u201cThank God that we do not have that model where the Prime Minister is the de facto minister of finance,\u201d Sir Franklyn told Tribune Business. \u201cExperience has shown whether it was Pindling, Ingraham or Christie, it\u2019s hard under that model to resist pressure to open up the purse.\n\n\u201cThank God we don\u2019t have that model today. Hopefully, the deputy prime minister has the ability on his part to say: \u2018Man, let\u2019s not look at this thing in the short run\u2019. The late Paul Adderley increased taxes right before the 1992 general election. He had to know that what he was doing was good for the country even if it was bad for the party.\n\n\u201cI say to Mr Turnquest: \u2018Keep in mind the Paul Adderley model\u2019. Do the right thing. If you do the right thing for the country it may not be good for the party, but country first.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A well-known businessman yesterday voiced fears that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of Nassau\u00a0residents may not feel the benefits even with\u00a0the capital\u2019s economy\u00a0poised for \u201ca good inning\u201d in 2020.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"description": "A well-known businessman yesterday voiced fears that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of Nassau\u00a0residents may not feel the benefits even with\u00a0the capital\u2019s economy\u00a0poised for \u201ca good inning\u201d in 2020.", "og": {"title": "Most\u00a0Bahamians to miss growth benefits", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.tribune242.com/news/2019/dec/31/most-bahamians-miss-growth-benefits/"}, "viewport": "width=1020"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.tribune242.com/news/2019/dec/31/most-bahamians-miss-growth-benefits/"}
