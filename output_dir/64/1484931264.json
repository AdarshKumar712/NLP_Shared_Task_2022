Sign up here.\n\nThousands of tourists have been told to flee as Australia\u2019s wildfires look set to worsen, Kim Jong Un has once again lived up to his unpredictable reputation, and investors are marveling over Bitcoin\u2019s bull run last decade. Here are some of the things people in the markets are talking about today.\n\nGet Out\n\nThousands of tourists holidaying on the south coast of Australia\u2019s New South Wales state have been told to evacuate before the weekend when extreme weather is set to intensify deadly wildfires sweeping through the region. In an unprecedented appeal, the Rural Fire Service said anyone in the southeastern tip of the state should get out in the next two days. The 230-kilometer (143-mile) stretch from Batemans Bay down to the Victoria state border has been ravaged by fires this week, producing apocalyptic scenes as infernos turned the sky blood red and rained down embers and ash on communities. At least seven people have been killed on the south coast of New South Wales just this week and hundreds of properties destroyed. Right now, isolated communities in Victoria remain cut off by road, including the township of Mallacoota, where some 4,000 people were forced to shelter on the beach or escape by boat as wildfires swept through. Military helicopters and ships have been scrambled to bring in supplies and for potential evacuations if roads can\u2019t be re-opened.\n\n\u201cPay for the Pains\u201d\n\nKim Jong Un declared he was no longer bound by his pledge to halt major missile tests and would soon debut a \u201cnew strategic weapon,\u201d adding to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy concerns in a politically charged election year. The North Korean leader told a gathering of party officials in Pyongyang that U.S. actions left him no choice but to reconsider commitments that underpinned three unprecedented meetings with Trump over the past 18 months, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday. Kim called for \u201cshocking actual action\u201d to make the U.S. \u201cpay for the pains\u201d suffered by North Korea under the Washington-led sanctions regime, KCNA said. The speech came during an unusual four-day party meeting and appeared to replace the televised address Kim has delivered every New Year\u2019s Day since 2013. Kim is seeking sanctions relief and security guarantees that the Trump administration has so far refused to provide without a disarmament commitment from Pyongyang.\n\nMarkets Wait\n\nTraders eyed a cautious start on Thursday in Asia as they assessed the latest policy move by China\u2019s central bank and awaited data on the country\u2019s manufacturing sector. Australia\u2019s dollar and the yen edged lower. Activity is set to pick up as most global markets reopen from holiday closures on Jan. 1, though Japanese equities remain shut for the remainder of this week. The People\u2019s Bank of China on Wednesday said it will increase the supply of cheap funding to banks, a move of policy support in line with market expectations. Markets start this year on the back of a strong performance for global stocks and sovereign bonds in 2019. Thursday gives investors the latest read on Chinese manufacturing with the Caixin manufacturing PMI expected to hover around its November level \u2014 remaining well in the expansionary zone. Elsewhere, crude fell 1% to $61.06 a barrel on Dec. 31, and gold was at $1,517.29 an ounce.\n\nUnbeatable Bitcoin\n\nIf in the throes of this bull market\u2019s earliest stages of recovery someone told you to forgo stocks, forget commodities, renounce fixed-income assets and buy an unknown digital token, the first of its kind, and watch it grow beyond your wildest dreams, you\u2019d call them crazy, right? Emerging out of the ashes of the financial crisis, Bitcoin was created as a bypass to the banks and government agencies mired in Wall Street\u2019s greatest calamity in decades. At first, it was slow to break through, but once it burst into the mainstream, it proved to be the decade\u2019s best-performing asset. The largest digital token, trading around $7,200, has posted gains of more than 9,000,000% since July 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 merely tripled in that period. An index that tracks world markets has more than doubled and gold is up 25%.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Sybilla Gross"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 22:29:46 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on what's moving Asia\u2019s markets in your inbox every morning?\u00a0Sign up here.Thousands of tourists have been told to flee as Australia\u2019s wildfires look set to worsen, Kim Jong Un has once again lived up to his unpredictable reputation, and investors are marveling over", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooNews", "card": "summary", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on what's moving Asia\u2019s markets in your inbox every morning?\u00a0Sign up here.Thousands of tourists have been told to flee as Australia\u2019s wildfires look set to worsen, Kim Jong Un has once again lived up to his unpredictable reputation, and investors are marveling over", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png"}, "title": "Five Things You Need to Know to Start Your Day"}, "application-name": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines", "news_keywords": "Kim Jong Un, Donald Trump, Carlos Ghosn, Korean Central News Agency, wildfires, manufacturing sector", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=3aa8b682-8617-30f1-a304-17967760c7f5&src=web", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on what's moving Asia\u2019s markets in your inbox every morning?\u00a0Sign up here.Thousands of tourists have been told to flee as Australia\u2019s wildfires look set to worsen, Kim Jong Un has once again lived up to his unpredictable reputation, and investors are marveling over", "og": {"type": "article", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on what's moving Asia\u2019s markets in your inbox every morning?\u00a0Sign up here.Thousands of tourists have been told to flee as Australia\u2019s wildfires look set to worsen, Kim Jong Un has once again lived up to his unpredictable reputation, and investors are marveling over", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "title": "Five Things You Need to Know to Start Your Day", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/five-things-know-start-day-222946315.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 338028696036, "app_id": 458584288257241}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=3aa8b682-8617-30f1-a304-17967760c7f5&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=3aa8b682-8617-30f1-a304-17967760c7f5&src=web"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://news.yahoo.com/five-things-know-start-day-222946315.html"}
