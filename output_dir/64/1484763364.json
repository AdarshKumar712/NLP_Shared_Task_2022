from JYP girlgroup Twice, and Kim Heechul from SM's Superjunior, have been confirmed dating.\n\nAccording to Korean Entertainment News platform Soompi, the report was confirmed by the news outlet, Market News which published a report at midnight KST on January 2 stating that according to their investigation, they were exclusively reporting that Momo and Heechul are dating.\n\nMarket News is the outlet that reported in August that Momo and Heechul were in a relationship, and in the January 2 report they mentioned that Super Junior's Label and JYP Entertainment had denied that they are dating at the time.\n\nKim Heechul and Momo have been seen together on several shows, like Weekly Idol which featured Heechul as a temporary host and Momo as part of her girlgroup, Twice several times. Momo has also been on Knowing Bros, with him. Most of the times on these shows, Heechul has been really impressed by Momo, who hails from Japan and is a dancer. One of the video clips which went viral at the time of an episode of Weekly Idol airing was a clip where Momo re-enacts a Japanese character saying 'Nicco nicco ni,' to do aego, a cute display of affection often expressed including but not limited to through a cute/baby voice, facial expressions, and gestures.\n\nAs news of them confirmed to be dating broke, fans couldn't be happier, being super supportive despite of some pointing out that Kim Heechul and Momo have an age difference of 13 years. 'Momo' became a Twitter trend worldwide as fans woke up to the news.\n\nCONGRATS TO THIS COUPLE pic.twitter.com/YuUSMjd9mi \u2014 Kim yohan \u3147\u3147 (@centerbunny) January 1, 2020\n\nSupport them or pic.twitter.com/1c8atwjf3i \u2014 NCT & ATEEZ Enthusiast (@atinycupofnct) January 1, 2020\n\nHeechul has been a big fan of Momo since forever :\")I'm happy their relationship developed once they got closer, please everyone support them and respect them, they're both grown up peoples with their own will not your dolls \u2764pic.twitter.com/mHSABczz7a \u2014 \u2764 D&\u0154 (@Kkeke_99) January 1, 2020\n\nFINALLY!
