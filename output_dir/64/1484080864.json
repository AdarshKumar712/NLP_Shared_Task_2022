We\u2019re pulling out the top five below for a closer look, but it\u2019s interesting too to see some of the other trends emerging across the rest of the pack.\n\nAutomotive remains a huge pull when it comes to raising big bucks: part of the reason is because the space is capital intensive, as it straddles both software and hardware (that is, not just equipment but cars).\n\nCapex is another reason for some of the other big investment rounds of the year, such as the biggest of them all, for an internet data center startup.\n\nAsian companies figure massive in the list and account for 7 of the 10 biggest rounds in the list.\n\nSmall players: there were only three companies in health tech in the top 50, only one in education technology, and only three in the areas of AI and robotics. I don\u2019t know if that means these areas simply don\u2019t require as much capital investment, or if these challenges are simply not as interesting right now for investors as those more squarely focused on revenue generation and business needs.\n\nHopefully the former, as the wider tech world faces a lot of cynicism and skepticism from the public and could use a better profile from solving actual problems.\n\nNote: for this piece, we have focused on investments made in pre-IPO technology companies, and on new equity investments rather than secondary or debt rounds.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["2019 tech"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 17:11:05 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Funding for tech startups has been on an inevitable upswing for years, a result of a virtuous circle where wildly successful tech companies on the public", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://citinewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cropped-CNR-Logo-1-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The five biggest rounds in tech in 2019 and what they mean", "site_name": "Citinewsroom - Comprehensive News in Ghana, Current Affairs,  Business News , Headlines, Ghana Sports, Entertainment, Politics, Articles, Opinions, Viral Content", "description": "Funding for tech startups has been on an inevitable upswing for years, a result of a virtuous circle where wildly successful tech companies on the public", "url": "https://citinewsroom.com/2020/01/the-five-biggest-rounds-in-tech-in-2019-and-what-they-mean/", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://citinewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Technology.jpg", "secure_url": "https://citinewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Technology.jpg", "width": 750, "height": 422}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T17:11:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T17:11:05+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/larte.david", "section": "Technology", "tag": "2019 tech", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/citi97.3"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The five biggest rounds in tech in 2019 and what they mean", "description": "Funding for tech startups has been on an inevitable upswing for years, a result of a virtuous circle where wildly successful tech companies on the public", "url": "https://citinewsroom.com/2020/01/the-five-biggest-rounds-in-tech-in-2019-and-what-they-mean/", "site": "@citi973", "image": "https://citinewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Technology.jpg", "creator": "@nlartelartey"}, "description": "Funding for tech startups has been on an inevitable upswing for years, a result of a virtuous circle where wildly successful tech companies on the public", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://citinewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cropped-CNR-Logo-1-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://citinewsroom.com/2020/01/the-five-biggest-rounds-in-tech-in-2019-and-what-they-mean/"}
