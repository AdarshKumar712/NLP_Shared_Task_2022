Achana pleaded with Ghanaians to be\n\nhumble in 2020 and seek God\u2019s guidance before taking any decision especially\n\npolitical leaders in an election year.\n\n\u201cThe New Year gives us the opportunity to\n\nreflect on the old year and do away with some bad behaviours and then make\n\ndecisions for the rest of the months\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 the false prophets will continue to\n\nexploit us for their personal gains just like they are doing, let us take note\n\nand stay away from them since they are using the Holy Bible for their selfish\n\nmotives\u201d,she said.\n\nThere was euphoria, ecstasy, display of\n\nfireworks and shouts of praise in the church when the clock struck 00:00 hours\n\nto usher in the New Year, 2020.\n\nGNA", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.ghanamma.com/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.ghanamma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/social-false-prophets.jpg"}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Print Wednesday 1st January, 2020 news, story, article By Dominic Andonye, GNA Wa, Jan. 01, GNA \u2013 The Reverend Minister of the Mangu Methodist Church in in Wa, Rev.
