The two GMO corn species feature qualities such as being resistant to insects and weedkillers, according to the ministry.\n\nIn a similar move in 2009, the ministry awarded biosafety certificates to a genetically modified corn species and two GMO rice species, but none of them has been approved for commercial production.\n\nHowever, insect-resistant GMO cotton has been grown on more than 31 million hectares across China, helping to reduce the use of pesticides by more than 70%, according to the ministry.\n\n\"After passing safety evaluations, GMO researchers and developers must complete some other procedures before the GMO species can be put into commercial use and be available on the market, including gaining different permits for the production of the seeds and production of the species,\" said Wang Xiping, a professor of life sciences at Beijing Normal University.\n\nAcademic opinion generally accepted that GMO products were safe, she said, but safety evaluation standards varied in different countries. GMO crops, such as soybeans, were already grown extensively in countries such as the United States and Brazil, she said.\n\nGMO technology helps improve the quality of crops, such as making them more productive and resistant to insects, and therefore also protects the environment through reduced use of pesticides and fertilisers, Wang said.\n\nOf all agricultural species, only GMO corn and papaya have been approved for commercial planting in China, while some GMO plants, such as soybean and corn, are allowed to be exported to China as material for food processing, according to the ministry.\n\nAll GMO products available on the domestic market have passed strict safety evaluations and are safe, the ministry said.\n\nThe ministry encourages scientific research and development in GMO technology, but remains cautious in its commercialisation. Commercial promotion efforts will first focus on agricultural species that cannot be eaten, such as cotton, and products used as staple food, including rice and soybeans, will come last, it said.\n\nResearch into GMO crops in China started in the 1980s, among the earliest in the world, and breakthroughs in the research and development of GMO species, such as insect-resistant rice, drought-resistant wheat and weedkiller-resistant soybeans, have been made in recent years, according to the ministry. - China Daily/Asia News Network", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["China", "GMO", "safety", "tests"], "tags": ["China"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "<p>BEIJING (China Daily/ANN): A total of 192 genetically modified plant specie- including two corn species and a soybean specie - are expected to pass biosafety evaluations by Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, opening the way to their commercial use in China.</p>", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/theme_metro/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"ROBOTS": "index,follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "<p>BEIJING (China Daily/ANN): A total of 192 genetically modified plant specie- including two corn species and a soybean specie - are expected to pass biosafety evaluations by Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, opening the way to their commercial use in China.</p>", "keywords": "China,GMO,safety,tests", "cXenseParse": {"smg-keywords": "tests", "author": "The Star Online", "pageclass": "article", "smg-accesstype": "free", "recs": {"publishtime": "2020-01-02T12:54:00+0800"}, "articleid": 180926, "smg-contenttype": "Article", "kicker_name": "China", "kicker_url": "/tag/china"}, "pageType": "article", "url": "https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2020/01/02/china039s-gmo-crops-set-to-pass-biosafety-tests", "datePublished": "2020-01-02 12:54:00", "dateModified": "2020-01-02 12:57:15", "inLanguage": "en", "cxenseRandom": "k4we6m8u6m1y3eboxm3e", "page_type": "Article", "content_type": "Article", "content_id": 180926, "content_title": "China's GMO crops set to pass biosafety tests", "content_category": "News/Regional", "content_author": "NA", "content_sp": "NA", "content_byline": "NA", "content_agency": "NA", "content_language": "English", "content_date": "2020-01-02", "content_tags": "China,GMO,safety,tests", "content_tier": "Free", "content_length": "Medium", "parsely-metadata": "{\"guid\": \"180926\", \"byline\": \"NA\", \"summary\": \"<p>BEIJING (China Daily/ANN): A total of 192 genetically modified plant specie- including two corn species and a soybean specie - are expected to pass biosafety evaluations by Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, opening the way to their commercial use in China.</p>\", \"image_url\" :\"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/01/02/467195.jpeg\",\"contain_video\": false,\"is_premium\": false,\"is_print\": false,\"access_type\": \"free\" ,\"kicker_name\": \"China\",\"kicker_url\": \"/tag/china\" }", "thumbnailUrl": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/01/02/467195.jpeg", "article": {"modified_time": "2020-01-02T12:57:15.000Z", "published_time": "2020-01-02T12:54:00.000Z", "section": "News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 121120175250633}, "og": {"url": "https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2020/01/02/china039s-gmo-crops-set-to-pass-biosafety-tests", "title": "China's GMO crops set to pass biosafety tests", "description": "<p>BEIJING (China Daily/ANN): A total of 192 genetically modified plant specie- including two corn species and a soybean specie - are expected to pass biosafety evaluations by Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, opening the way to their commercial use in China.</p>", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "The Star Online", "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/01/02/467195.jpeg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "China's GMO crops set to pass biosafety tests", "description": "<p>BEIJING (China Daily/ANN): A total of 192 genetically modified plant specie- including two corn species and a soybean specie - are expected to pass biosafety evaluations by Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, opening the way to their commercial use in China.</p>", "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/01/02/467195.jpeg"}, "article_section_name": "News", "csrf-token": "G2nwNVgnrwYPJjvYULYN7exmReiDLW5pnXvrFbJe", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=428184176"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2020/01/02/china039s-gmo-crops-set-to-pass-biosafety-tests"}
