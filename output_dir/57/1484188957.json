Jackbox Games\n\nIt\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve, you\u2019re sitting around with friends waiting for the ball to drop, and you\u2019d rather not watch tired musical acts vamping on TV. Jackbox Games releases their party packs for just such an occasion, and Jackbox Party Pack 6 is the latest installment.\n\nAll Jackbox games operate the same way: You fire up the game on your console, smart TV or about a million other platforms, and all your guests pull out their phones, tablets, laptops, etc. The games\u2019 prompts are on the TV; the guests\u2019 answers and drawings and selections are on their devices.\n\nIt\u2019s a great system, because half the fun of Jackbox games are seeing things that are kept hidden from you until they\u2019re displayed. While Jackbox Party Pack 6 (ranging in price from $21-$30 depending on platform) isn\u2019t the best Jackbox Games offering \u2014 it\u2019s missing some notable, wonderful games from previous packages, including Drawful and Fibbage \u2014 it\u2019s a solid outing in the series if you already own the previous titles.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t ever played Jackbox games, try one of the earlier collections first (numbers one through three are particularly strong.)\n\nParty Pack 6 includes:\n\nTrivia Murder Party 2: One of the best in the bunch, this sequel turns you into woven dolls and asks you trivia questions, pitting you against your friends in a race to escape a haunted hotel in time.\n\nDictionarium: The favorite among my family this holiday, this game asks you to set meanings for fake words, words for meanings and antonyms, then vote on the frequently-hilarious results.\n\nPush The Button: A twist on the \u201cwho\u2019s the murderer\u201d genre, this game makes some of the people in your party aliens, then presents slightly different questions to aliens and non-aliens. The whole group votes on who\u2019s answering just a little oddly, and once people think they know the answer, they can \u201cPush the Button\u201d to put two people in an airlock and jettison them into space. Manipulating this game as an alien is pretty darned fun.\n\nJoke Boat: One of the weaker entries, this game asks you to come up with snappy jokes about supplied topics, which is a core part of all Jackbox games. For some reason, the prompts here don\u2019t work as well as they do in other titles from earlier collections, such as Quiplash.\n\nRole Models: This game has the group pick out who amongst them is best suited for different characters/roles \u2014 the characters in Alice in Wonderland, say, or the seasons of the year \u2014 and then assigns them personality types as a result.\n\nOur group of five didn\u2019t get into this much, and while my downvote may be affected by my being declared a \u201cdomineering angry dreamer\u201d at the end \u2014 you can guess who got to be the Red Queen! \u2014 we played it just once and moved on.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["new year's eve", "party games", "jackbox games", "jackbox party pack 6"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Heather Newman", "I Ve Been A Gaming", "Technology Journalist For More Than Years.
