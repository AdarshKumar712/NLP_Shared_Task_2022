Click here.\n\nLooking for a New Year\u2019s resolution? Talk to your kids about capitalism versus socialism and Communism.\n\n\u201cThe blame shouldn\u2019t be on universities, although they\u2019re certainly doing their part indoctrinating our kids,\u201d Fox News host Rachel Campos-Duffy said on the Todd Starnes Show. \u201cAs parents, we are failing our children.\u201d\n\nCampos-Duffy said parents must fight back against left wing indoctrination by educating their children around the dinner table and in the car. Click here to listen to the entire interview.\n\n\u201cIf you are not talking about Socialism and Communism versus Capitalism, if you\u2019re not talking about opportunity, if you\u2019re not talking about the kind of religious liberty and personal free speech liberty that you will lose under Socialism, the kind of political repression that you see under Socialism and Communism and the poverty that it has always ended up bringing to any country that allows itself to fall into it, you\u2019re not doing your job as a parent.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re also not doing your job as a Christian, she stressed.\n\n\u201cCommunism and socialism are atheistic, anti-religion ideologies, and so we as parents have to do a better job.\u201d\n\nA disturbing survey released by the Victims of Communism Memorial Fund showed a dramatic increase in the number of millennials who favor Communism.\n\nThe survey found 36 percent of Millennials (people ages 23 to 38) approve of Communism. That\u2019s up from 28 percent in 2018. Meanwhile, 70 percent of Millennials surveyed say they are likely to vote socialist.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge, huge problem on our university and public school campuses,\u201d said Starnes.\n\n\u201cIf we cede these issues to the public schools and Marxist professors at our kids\u2019 universities, we will lose this battle for the youth,\u201d warned Campos-Duffy.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 13:56:11 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.toddstarnes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TS-2.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Fox News Host Warns: If You Aren't Teaching Your Kids About Freedom, You Aren't Doing your Job as a Parent", "description": "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: Facebook is cracking down on Conservative content.
