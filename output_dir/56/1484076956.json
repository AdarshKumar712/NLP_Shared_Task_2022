(WATE) \u2014 With the 2010s now in the rearview mirror, we\u2019re looking back at the big news and sports stories in East Tennessee that helped shape the decade.\n\nBelow are the WATE 6 On Your Side Decade in Review videos \u2013 featuring file content from our coverage of some of the major news stories in our region; as well as the news briefs to coincide with the video clips.\n\nDecade in Review Part 1 (2010-2015)\n\n2010\n\nKnoxville\u2019s top story saw a local leader step up to the state level with then-mayor Bill Haslam, who was elected to become the Governor of Tennessee.\n\n2011\n\nA shake-up for South Knoxville kicked off 2011, with the closure of the Henley Bridge.\n\nPlus, history was made for Knoxville\u2019s top office \u2013 Daniel Brown became the city\u2019s first black mayor, as interim leader after Haslam became governor.

From that, an outpouring of support helped by homegrown superstar local Dolly Parton.\n\n2017\n\nPeople around the area turned their gaze skyward as parts of East Tennessee had the perfect vantage point the see a total solar eclipse.\n\nThe year also brought chaos to UT Athletics with the firing of Coach Butch Jones and fans revolting against the hiring of Greg Schiano. The university\u2019s reputation took a nose-dive in the national press. Then, then-athletics director John Currie was replaced by legendary former Vols Football Coach Phillip Fulmer.\n\n2018\n\nThe year brought political transitions with Tim Burchett\u2019s term limited as Knox County Mayor. In a squeaker of an election, former pro-wrestler Glenn Jacobs won the primary and went on to win the general to become the county\u2019s new mayor.\n\nCongressman Jimmy Duncan had announced the year before he wasn\u2019t running for re-election, marking the end of a political dynasty. He had held the seat since the 1980s; before that, it was his father\u2019s seat since the 1960s.\n\nTim Burchett and fellow Republicans like Jimmy Matlock made the primary one of the hottest area races in a long time.
