On the public health front, the country recorded hundreds of deaths from measles and the return of polio after 19 years. For the first time, the country also registered the fastest rate of HIV infection in the world.\n\nThere are now two laws to prevent the spread of HIV and discrimination against persons living with HIV / AIDS. The challenge is their efficient implementation \u2013 which also goes for the Universal Health Care and mental health laws.\n\nOn another health issue, the country saw the arrival of African swine fever in 2019. The ASF threat continues to inflict damage on the local swine industry and needs tighter management.\n\nAlso needing urgent attention on the food front are the country\u2019s rice farmers, who saw their livelihood devastated in 2019 by rice tariffication that allowed unlimited rice importation. While consumers welcomed the lower rice prices, the country cannot afford to be overly dependent on imports of its staple.\n\nFor the first time last year, the country\u2019s 15-year-olds joined the Program for International Student Assessment. The PISA results were disheartening, with the Filipinos ranking last out of 79 nationalities in reading comprehension and 78th in mathematics and science. This is a continuing challenge for improvement.\n\nEven the country\u2019s top ranking in the 30th Southeast Asian Games poses the challenge of sustaining the exemplary performance in bigger competitions particularly the Olympics. There must also be accountability in the hosting arrangements as well as efforts to ensure that the Olympic Village in New Clark City won\u2019t turn into a white elephant.\n\nIn Metro Manila, 2019 saw an acute water shortage and a persistent traffic mess that call for multipronged solutions, with the necessary infrastructure taking years to complete. Build, Build, Build must move faster this year to make up for the delay caused by congressional bickering over the 2019 national budget.\n\nIn 2019, Philippine offshore gaming operators created problems that the government must address with a clear policy on online gambling and the employment of foreigners. Related to this, the government must heed public sentiment, as expressed in surveys, for a stronger assertion of the country\u2019s sovereign rights in the West Philippine Sea.\n\nThere are the continuing problems \u2013 the communist insurgency, Islamist extremism that now employs suicide bombers, a weak and compromised judicial system that makes law enforcement shortcuts acceptable to ordinary people. The war on drugs is being recalibrated as the scourge persists. There is much work ahead; at the start of the year, everyone must hit the ground running.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["hiv infection", "polio virus"], "tags": ["HIV INFECTION", "CHINA", "2016 ARBITRAL RULING", "INDONESIA", "PHILIPPINES-CHINA TIES", "SOUTH CHINA SEA", "POLIO VIRUS", "CHINA COAST GUARD", "BUILD BUILD BUILD PROJECTS", "GENG SHUANG", "EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "After the revelry, it\u2019s time to buckle down to work.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.philstar.com/images/Home/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "-XDnbcliO_8moaHtwWwt6bfL7OuZJxdwORPCeqtmRZU", "msvalidate.01": "A420D7D07ED09E5C42E6F71783C169FE", "dailymotion-domain-verification": "dmnqtuxevpqh4qp3c", "keywords": "hiv infection,polio virus", "description": "After the revelry, it\u2019s time to buckle down to work.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=532930273", "fb": {"app_id": 1775905922621109}, "og": {"type": "website", "title": "EDITORIAL - Challenges | Philstar.com", "url": "https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2020/01/02/1981353/editorial-challenges", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.philstar.com/photos/2020/01/01/edicartoon-1-2_2020-01-01_19-58-19.jpg", "url": "https://media.philstar.com/photos/2020/01/01/edicartoon-1-2_2020-01-01_19-58-19.jpg"}, "description": "After the revelry, it\u2019s time to buckle down to work.", "site_name": "philstar.com"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@philstarnews", "creator": "@philstarnews", "description": "After the revelry, it\u2019s time to buckle down to work.", "title": "EDITORIAL - Challenges | Philstar.com", "image": "https://media.philstar.com/photos/2020/01/01/edicartoon-1-2_2020-01-01_19-58-19.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-signin-scope": "profile email", "google-signin-client_id": "901299274787-uhltbpsq076q893g1pbfe765frnelm5j.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2020/01/02/1981353/editorial-challenges"}
