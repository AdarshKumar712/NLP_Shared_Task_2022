The biggest legends in American baseball history all set records and achieved international fame playing with Louisville Slugger bats, the players\u2019 names immortalized in the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory Hall of Fame in Kentucky.\n\nBut what about the men and women who worked in the factories, the artisans and engravers who produced their iconic bats for America\u2019s favorite pastime? What were their names, and what were their stories?\n\nThose are the questions being answered right now in Louisville, Kentucky. As part of the city\u2019s biennial celebration, the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory dug out a trove of old photos, many black and white, from decades and decades of the company\u2019s history. The pictures were a snapshot into not only the company\u2019s past but of post-war American life. But many of the proud faces\u2019 identities were unknown.\n\nRuby Judd worked at Louisville Slugger for 50 years filling ordered filling orders and doing quality inspection. She was identified by her niece, Laura Quiggins, who said: \u2018She was very proud of her job, very proud of the product that they put out'\n\nAn unidentified man whittles down a baseball bat. In celebration of Louisville, Kentucky's biennial, the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory is hosting an exhibit that showcases vintage photos of employees that worked in the Hillerich and Bradsby factory over the years. A local campaign asked family, friends and former colleagues to help identify the nameless faces\n\nThe Hillerich and Bradsby is a woodworking company that began in 1856 and manufactured various items such as golf clubs butter churns before it made its first bat in 1884. Maril Addams (pictured) is seen operating a lathe on golf club heads\n\nA local campaign advertised the museum exhibit and showcased the photos in regional media. That\u2019s when friends and colleagues of former workers began collaborating with the effort, and now many of those earnest, nameless faces have been identified.\n\n\u2018Back in those days, people took such pride in their work,\u2019 says Laura Quiggins, who identified her aunt, Ruby Judd, who was an inspector and order filler more than 50 years ago for Hillerich and Bradsby, the company which began manufacturing Louisville Slugger bats. \u2018Nowadays, it\u2019s like people just go to work to get the paycheck \u2013 \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d\n\n\u2018She was very proud of her job, very proud of the product that they put out,\u2019 Quiggins tells DailyMail.com. \u2018It\u2019s so simple, but a little piece of wood made people famous, and those people made the bat famous.\u2019\n\nThe effort came about when the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory was asked to participate in the Louisville Biennial, and curator Bailey Mazik thought of the photos she\u2019d seen in archives and desks, folders of workers in the factories, men and women working for a company that began in 1856 and manufactured everything from butter churns to golf clubs to the famous bats \u2013 production of which began in 1884. The company receives information about former players on a daily basis, she says \u2013 but this was something new and special.\n\nAn unidentified man carefully works on a persimmon golf club head at a table saw at the Hillerich and Bradsby company\n\nEmployee Bill Lesch inspecting rough-turned timber. 17-year-old,John \"Bud\" Hillerich began making baseball bats in the 1880s after watching Louisville's major league team star player, Pete \"Louisville Slugger\" Browning break his bat during a game\n\nEmployee Ray Sizemore weighing a roughout in 1975\n\nQuinton Jackson is pictured dipping bats in an undated photo\n\nAn unidentified employee is seen branding bats. Rena Jenkins, a longtime current employee who began at the company in 1977 instantly recognized a former employee by the name of Georgia Hines. She told DailyMail.com: '...she was a little bitty lady. She probably weighed maybe 110 pounds fully clothed...but she could engrave a bat. Back then, that was her job. She was the only one that did that back then'\n\n\u2018One of our former vice presidents was kind of an amateur historian himself, so he collected a lot of these and organized these and wrote down a lot of employees\u2019 names,\u2019 Bailey Mazik says of Jack McGrath, who retired in the 80s.\n\nPolly Basham (left) stands with two Hillerich and Bradsby employees in front of a wall of baseball bats\n\nShe adds: \u2018It has been important for us to know who these people are and to celebrate their hard work.\u2019\n\nOne of those people was Quiggins\u2019 Aunt Ruby.\n\n\u2018She was an inspector and an order-filler,\u2019 Quiggins tells DailyMail.com. \u2018She inspected the bats and, when someone placed an order for them, she did the quality assurance \u2026 She had worked in several departments, because she was there for years.\u2019\n\nAunt Ruby, who married and had two children, \u2018loved her job,\u2019 Quiggins says.\n\n\u2018My grandfather worked with wood a lot and made things with wood, and he was a whittler. So she said going into work was like going into Dad\u2019s house. She had built a big long 18-by-12 cedar closet in their house, so their house smelled like cedar \u2013 and she said that\u2019s the only smell I don\u2019t smell at work, is cedar. She smelled oak and all the other woods. She said it was a family-oriented place \u2026 Everybody knew everybody. She loved working there.\n\n\u2018That was the place to work, back in the day. It was General Electric, Ford and Hillerich and Bradsby.\u2019\n\nEmployee Arthur Peyton branding a bat in an undated photo.

January 15, 1958\n\nWillie Leonard is pictured in an undated photo working on metal golf club heads\n\nThe company has always been based in the Louisville region, and the Kentucky city has become almost synonymous with baseball bats. Tributes to players and their bats are included on a mile-long Walk of Fame through the city, and the Museum is easily identifiable by the world\u2019s largest bat standing proudly outside of it.\n\nPaula Dyer, another woman who identified her aunt and uncle \u2013 both Hillerich and Bradsby employees \u2013 echoed the sentiments of Ms Quiggins.\n\nHillerich and Bradsby was the \u2018name I grew up with,\u2019 she says. Her Aunt Polly and Uncle John \u2018Buck\u2019 Basham started in the 40s and retired in the 70s.\n\nBuck was a WWII Army veteran, and Dyer\u2019s mother and father had worked for Hillerich and Bradsby before leaving, helping her own parents get their jobs.\n\n\u2018They would get up in the morning ... they were dedicated employees,\u2019 Dyer says of Polly and Buck. They would get up at four in the morning; they would never be a minute late. They never missed a day.\u2019\n\nShe adds: They were proud to work there, yes. It was hard work; they never complained too much about it.

Date unknown\n\nThe Bashams were so proud, in fact, that they incorporated their company\u2019s product into the cabin they built saving wages, she says.\n\n\u2018It was a two-story cabin, beautiful cabin, and the stairs \u2013 instead of plain old rails on each step, it was a Hillerich and Bradsby baseball bat, she tells DailyMail.com. \u2018And you know, none of us have pictures of it and it\u2019s so sad.\u2019\n\nUncle Buck died in 1976 at the age of 60 \u2013 only two years retired \u2013 and Aunt Polly passed away in 1999.\n\n\u2018To be able to recognize them for their hard work and dedication ... I just love it,\u2019 she says.\n\nPaula Dyer, identified her aunt Polly and uncle John 'Buck' Basham (pictured polishing a golf club head) in the trove of pictures on display at the Louisville Sluggar Museum & Factory. She told DailyMail.com 'They would never be a minute late. They never missed a day. They were proud to work there, yes. It was hard work; they never complained too much about it'\n\nThe Bashams were proud of the work they did for Hillerich and Bradsby, so much so that they incorporated their company\u2019s product into the cabin they built saving wages. \u2018It was a two-story cabin, beautiful cabin, and the stairs \u2013 instead of plain old rails on each step, it was a Hillerich and Bradsby baseball bat,' said Paula Dyer to DailyMail.com\n\nEmployee (William White) packing mini-bats. March 2007\n\nRena Jenkins, a longtime current employee who began at the company in 1977 as an 18-year-old on the switchboard, helped identify former workers from the binders of folders such as Georgia Heins.\n\nThe effort to name and picture so many people excited her and made her happy to help, she tells DailyMail.com.\n\n\u2018It is a legacy,\u2019 she says. \u2018It goes back so many generations ... I think they realize the history.\u2019\n\nShe adds that she still believes the company makes \u2018the greatest bat in the world\u2019 and \u2018it\u2019s as American as apple pie.\u2019\n\nShe\u2019s worked everywhere within the company from accounts payable to shipping and purchasing and in the warehouses and factories, helping her get to know so many employees over the years who were equally proud of their work. One of them was Georgia Heins, who she recognized amongst the pictures.\n\n\u2018She was real nice; she was a little bitty lady,\u2019 she says. \u2018She probably weighed maybe 110 pounds fully clothed and maybe with her pockets lined. She was 5\u20192, 5\u20191; she was a small woman, real skinny, but she could engrave a bat. Back then, that was her job. She was the only one that did that back then.'\n\nAn unidentified female employee is seen placing a gunstock cutout on a table saw.

Baseball bat cores used to be made of Ash wood but have since been changed to Maple wood after Barry Bonds broke the single-season home run record using Maple bats in 2001\n\nShe tells DailyMail.com that the company has always been \u2018like a family.\u2019\n\n\u2018There was a lot of us that started young, so we were young and inexperienced. We learned off of some of the older ones, and we all started having babies and raising our families, and everybody was always here for everybody else.\u2019\n\nMany of the positions, she admits, \u2018were tedious jobs \u2013 but they just had a little assembly line, and then you had a lot of husband and wives worked here. And then you had several that met their wives here and married.\u2019\n\n\u2018Years ago, whenever you had a baby, they used to send us a full-sized personalized bat with a letter from the president [of the company] saying: \u201cWelcome to the Hillerich and Bradsby family.\u201d And they would send us a personalized bat with the day they were born, their height, weight and all of that.

It has been really special to me to see how employees keep in touch with each other and how they take care of each other.\u2019\n\nThe exhibit will run through the end of January, but Mazik hopes it can lead to even further historical research and memorialization of the people responsible for the building blocks of America\u2019s favorite pastime.\n\n\u2018I want to sit down with some of these folks, do formal oral histories that we can archive,\u2019 she says.\n\nLaura Quiggins (left) stands in front of the worlds largest baseball bat outside the Louisville Sluggar Museum & Factory in Kentucky.
