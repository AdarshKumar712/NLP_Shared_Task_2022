Those who seek to come to the UK unlawfully and the ruthless criminals who facilitate journeys are all breaking the law and endangering lives.\n\n\u201cWe will always ensure we have the right resources in place to keep our border secure.\n\n\"A forty-two metre Border Force cutter and two coastal patrol vessels are patrolling the Channel and we are monitoring the situation closely over the Christmas and new year period.\"\n\nPatrols on French beaches as well as drones have been doubled while specialist vehicles and detection equipment have been deployed to prevent small boats leaving French shores, the spokeswoman added.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["migrants", "Home Office", "Border Force", "Immigration", "Sajid Javid", "UK", "News"], "tags": ["News", "Festival news", "Home Office", "Immigration", "Secret London", "TV reviews", "Best films", "Border Force", "migrants", "Sajid Javid", "Pop up"], "authors": ["Rebecca Speare-Cole"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 14:40:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Nearly 1,900\u00a0migrants arrived on UK shores in 2019, figures show.\u00a0 More than double the number of people arrived in small boats Britain in December last year, compared with December 2018.\u00a0 The figures, collated by the BBC, came as three more boats were intercepted off the Kent coast on New Year's Eve.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/img/shortcut-icons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#dc062b", "og": {"url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/migrants-border-force-sajid-javid-english-channel-a4324046.html", "title": "Nearly 1,900 migrants arrived on UK shores in 2019, figures show", "description": "Nearly 1,900\u00a0migrants arrived on UK shores in 2019, figures show.\u00a0 More than double the number of people arrived in small boats Britain in December last year, compared with December 2018.\u00a0 The figures, collated by the BBC, came as three more boats were intercepted off the Kent coast on New Year's Eve.", "updated_time": "2020-01-01T15:31:24+00:00", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/16/18/Migrantsdover1507g.jpg", "site_name": "Evening Standard", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB"}, "fb": {"pages": 165348596842143, "app_id": 193840110715213, "admins": 36903991}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/4324046"}, "description": "Nearly 1,900\u00a0migrants arrived on UK shores in 2019, figures show.\u00a0 More than double the number of people arrived in small boats Britain in December last year, compared with December 2018.\u00a0 The figures, collated by the BBC, came as three more boats were intercepted off the Kent coast on New Year's Eve.", "keywords": "migrants, Home Office, Border Force, Immigration, Sajid Javid, UK, News", "article": {"tag": "migrants", "published_time": "2020-01-01T14:40:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T15:31:24+00:00", "publisher": 165348596842143, "section": "UK", "author_name": "Rebecca Speare-Cole", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 390, "image_count": 2, "video_count": 0, "embed_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 6, "external_link_count": 0}, "twitter": {"title": "Nearly 1,900 migrants arrived on UK shores in 2019, figures show", "description": "Nearly 1,900\u00a0migrants arrived on UK shores in 2019, figures show.\u00a0 More than double the number of people arrived in small boats Britain in December last year, compared with December 2018.\u00a0 The", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@standardnews"}, "google-site-verification": "fI_fn7lv1QlqGWXMIJoqDICBG1ynAC0UDsrriO8e_m8", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Evening Standard"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/migrants-border-force-sajid-javid-english-channel-a4324046.html"}
