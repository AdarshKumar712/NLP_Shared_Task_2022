        <p class="post-excerpt">
            This week, the Census Bureau released the results of its formal test of the once-proposed, and now prevented, census citizenship question. The results are a striking rebuke to a recent leftist orthodoxy: Adding a citizenship question to a test-run of the census had no statistically significant effect on overall response rates. Even in the communities most sensitive to the question, such as neighborhoods with many Hispanics, response rates dropped only slightly.

To understand why this report is significant, step back to March 2018, when Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced that the 2020 census would include a question about citizenship status. Leftists were immediately outraged, seeing the addition as a racist

            <div class="reply-text">If you look at the 1940 US Census, which is readily available online, you will see hand entries that were done by a Census taker . At the bottom of the page you will find this table explaining the codes used for column 16 in the form:

Col. 16.CITIZENSHIP OF FOREIGN BORN:
Naturalized-------------------------- Na
Having First Papers-------------- Pa
Alien--------------------------------- Al
American Citizen Born Abroad-- Am Cit

Did no one in the Administration point out this historical fact in making their argument before the court?

There should have been no need for a justification as to why the question is being asked and they should have used the same format as was used in the past.</div>

            <div class="reply-text">This is really all about who gets represented in the House of Representatives, as the representation of US citizens who are qualified to vote in US elections is being diluted by the massive numbers of illegal aliens, who by their numbers alone, as determined by the census, are being used to reapportion Congressional seats from States with stable US citizen census counts, to mostly all leftist and liberal Democrat States where huge numbers of illegal aliens are residing in mostly all low income areas. Since those low income areas where the reapportioned Congressional seats are reapportioned to have high percentages of alien “constituents” who are not qualified to vote in US elections, it makes it much easier for the Democrats to win those new Congressional seats with much lower vote counts then in other Congressional Districts with high percentages of stable US citizen voters. What is needed to stop that practice is a decision by the US Supreme Court that the apportionment of Congressional Districts should be based only upon the census figures of US citizens residing in each State, and not the census figures relating to aliens, either legal aliens who may be tourists or foreign students, or illegal aliens, who are not qualified to vote in US elections.</div>

            <div class="reply-text">These findings should also be a striking rebuke to Chief Justice Roberts, who was unable to divine, in a timely fashion, whether Trump's motivations were sufficiently pure to allow him to proceed with executing what is clearly an executive branch prerogative, thereby blocking that action with a purely obstructive tactic.  This "clever" Chief Justice has repeatedly exposed himself as a rogue judge with a penchant for judicial tyranny.</div>

            <div class="reply-text">How is asking a question about being a citizen equate into racism. We are testing the validity of someone's citizen status, and if everyone had to answer how would that be racist or is it not racist to assume if a person is white and can speak the language they are a citizen?

        The umpteenth remake of Little Women, Louisa May Alcott’s witty 1868 girls’ novel about growing up in Concord, Massachusetts, during the Civil War, is directed by Greta Gerwig and stars her alter ego, the lovely Irish lass Saoirse Ronan, as Jo March.(Snip)This reflected the remarkable upbringing of Louisa May Alcott (1832–1888). Back before Mark Twain, American literature was kind of a who-you-know business, and the Alcotts knew everybody who was anybody in the author industry. Ralph Waldo Emerson lent her family the money to buy their house in Concord, Henry David Thoreau told them it was haunted, and they eventually sold it to Nathaniel Hawthorne.

        Anthony Weiner/Carlos Danger (2011, 2013, 2016)

Of all the politicians to find themselves in a sexting scandal, it had to be the one whose last name is Weiner. In 2011, Anthony Weiner, the married representative from New York, resigned after being caught sending explicit photos of his genitalia to several young women, some underage. (Snip)Lois Lerner and the IRS Targeting Scandal (2013)

The IRS decisions of which organizations gain tax-exempt status and which receive extensive scrutiny should have nothing to do with political orientation. However, in 2013, Lois Lerner, President Obama’s director of Exempt Organization Unit in the IRS, disagreed, and disproportionately targeted conservative groups applying for 501(c) status exemptions.

        This week, the Census Bureau released the results of its formal test of the once-proposed, and now prevented, census citizenship question. The results are a striking rebuke to a recent leftist orthodoxy: Adding a citizenship question to a test-run of the census had no statistically significant effect on overall response rates. Even in the communities most sensitive to the question, such as neighborhoods with many Hispanics, response rates dropped only slightly.

To understand why this report is significant, step back to March 2018, when Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced that the 2020 census would include a question about citizenship status. Leftists were immediately outraged, seeing the addition as a racist

        Amid all the stories about President Donald John Trump's triumphs in 2019 -- exoneration from Mueller, 3.5% unemployment, killing al-Baghdadi, and a 33% rise in my 401-k -- having Mexico protect our border is way down on the list.

Let me raise its profile because President Trump did the nearly impossible by getting Mexico to patrol our border. And he topped that by getting Mexico to keep people seeking asylum there until their cases are adjudicated.

On May 30, as he prepared to leave for a state visit to England, President Trump told Mexico to either start patrolling our border and taking those asylum seekers by the time I get back, or

        Magicians always divert attention, which frees them to do their sleight of hand. President Donald John Trump has perfected the craft to the point where he has become the diversion.

His tweets are red laser dots that the cats in the media chase. Real cats eventually catch on, but they continue to chase the dot.

Benjamin Wofford of the Washingtonian noticed the dot in his column, "While You Were Paying Attention to Ukraine, Here’s What Trump’s Appointees Achieved."

He wrote, "There were dozens of stories that flew under the radar—policy changes and personnel sagas, norms eroded and scores settled—that captured the essence of what happened in the marrow of Trump’s government.

        Christopher Roach, an attorney, has published two articles on impeachment during the past two weeks. They're both excellent, clear expositions of the principles behind what's going on. While it's impossible for Roach to offer an entirely dispositive opinion on how Trump and the Senate should proceed--simply because political considerations will inevitably intrude--his discussion is conceptually useful. By presenting a clear conceptual framework and understanding of impeachment under our Constitution, we get a better idea how whatever path is chosen should be framed in order to stand with the principles of our constitutional order.

        Supporters of an Iranian-backed militia besieged the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes, breaking through the first layer of security at the embassy compound and damaging a reception area before being expelled by Iraqi security forces. Here’s what we know:

●The U.S. Defense Department is sending two Apache helicopters and a “small contingent” of Marines to reinforce security at the embassy.

●President Trump accused Iran of “orchestrating an attack” on the embassy, where protesters ransacked a reception area and set fires.

●Iraqi security forces later intervened and set up a barricade, but protesters threw gasoline bombs into the compound.

        Crowds of angry Iraqis protesting America’s recent airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia laid siege to the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad Tuesday, chanting “Down, Down USA!” as they stormed through a main gate, prompting U.S. guards to fire back tear gas in response.

As of Tuesday night, protesters set up tents outside the embassy in the Iraqi capital where they said they intended to stage a sit-in “until American troops leave Iraq and the embassy is closed.” About 100 Marines are being sent to the embassy to bolster security and an Army Apache helicopter flew over the premises and dropped flares in a "show of force", hoping to disburse

        Everyone on both left and right these days is demanding rights—but not the earliest and most important one, the historic right to trial by a jury of one’s peers.

Today, over 90 percent of American defendants waive that right in favor of a prosecutor’s proposed plea bargain, because, as Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz notes in his new book Guilt by Association, they are warned that the penalty at the trial stage will be excessively higher.

Dershowitz offers frightening examples. Two men picked up their uncle after committing a robbery, making him a passenger in a police car chase where a trooper was shot and killed. The actual murdering robbers copped a

        Greta Thunberg's father told her to launch her climate protests alone, as he said he and is wife made green changes to their lives to "save" their daughter from her depression.

Svante Thunberg said he and his wife were “not climate activists” but had stopped flying and turned vegan as they saw the impact it had on their daughter.(Snip)He said the teenager became acutely depressed after being diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome when she was 12, and stopped talking, eating or going to school for a year.

“She stopped eating for three months,” added Mr Thunberg. “Which is the ultimate nightmare for any parent.”

        “It’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future,” Yogi Berra reminded us.(Snip)Looking to 2020, this writer predicted that Donald Trump’s great domestic challenge would be to keep the economy firing on all cylinders. His great foreign policy challenge? Avoiding war.

When one looks at the numbers — unemployment at or below 4% for two years, an expansion in its 11th year, the stock market regularly hitting all-time highs — Trump enters his reelection year with a fistful of aces. One has to go back half a century to find numbers like these. (Snip)If there are IEDs on Trump’s road to reelection, they may be found in the Middle and

        The mockumentary that aired Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” featured many sidesplitting moments; host Chuck Todd and other Democratic activists disguised as journalists spent an hour solemnly discussing the “assault on the truth” inflicted by Donald Trump and his “cult-like” followers.

 
(Snip)

 

One moment, however, stood out: Todd read aloud a letter-to-the editor published in a Kentucky newspaper that equated the Bible to a fairy tale. “Show me a person who believes in Noah’s Ark, and I will show you a Trump voter,” the rando correspondent wrote.

        VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis apologized Wednesday for his widely-viewed slap of a woman who had grabbed his hand as he greeted Catholic faithful on New Year’s Eve.
The image of Francis slapping his way free from the clutches of the admirer was an instant hit on social media.  A personal apology followed. “We lose patience many times,” Francis confessed. “It happens to me too. I apologize for the bad example given yesterday,” the head of the Catholic church said before celebrating Mass at the Vatican.

        The White House National Security Council staff is being downsized sharply in a bid to improve efficiency within the policy coordinating body by consolidating positions and cutting staff.

A second, unspoken thrust of the overhaul is a hoped-for end to what many critics see as a string of politically damaging, unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information. Leaks of President Trump’s conversations with foreign leaders and other damaging disclosures likely originated with anti-Trump officials in the White House who stayed over from the Obama administration, according to several current and former White House officials.

White House National Security Adviser Robert C. O’Brien is leading the NSC reform effort.

        For Republicans, the 2010s end with the party seemingly in a better situation than it was when the decade started. The GOP has control of the White House and the Senate. Ten years ago, the Democrats held the White House and both houses of Congress.

But that scorecard doesn't tell the whole story. Thanks to five major blunders over the last decade, the Republican Party is actually weaker than it was on Jan.1, 2010. To understand why, you have to document each key mistake in order:

        Iran-backed militiamen behind an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, have begun retreating from the area on Wednesday following a threat from President Donald Trump to hold Tehran accountable for the siege. “Supporters of the Kataib Hezbollah militia who had spent the night camped outside the embassy began dismantling their tents and leaving the area, saying they had won a victory and would now seek the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq through the nation’s parliament,” the Washington Post reports.

        Nancy Pelosi, AKA Nasty Nancy, allowed Adam Schiff, AKA Shifty Schiff, to run the impeachment "inquiry" through Shifty's Intelligence Committee, where Shifty had total control.  He set the rules to allow only the witnesses he wanted.  He lied in his opening statement to commence the inquiry by making up President Trump's phone conversation with Ukraine's President Zelensky.  The resulting vote to impeach was a foregone conclusion regardless of the evidence, or lack thereof.

Pelosi has not sent Shifty's articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial because she said she wants to first see the Senate trial procedures.

        Ever since it was discovered that several armed churchgoers drew their weapons to stop a gunman at a church in Texas last week, the anti-gun mainstream media types have been trying to tell the public that armed, law-abiding citizens are a bad thing.

The New Year's Day installment of media malpractice hyperbole arrives courtesy of the nauseatingly leftist USA Today: "@USATODAY Opinion: Jack Wilson is exactly the type of person you want around with a gun because he's a firearms instructor. But we know nothing about the at least six other parishioners who also appeared to draw their handguns. And that's terrifying."

        When Kimberly Dudik ran for her fourth term in the Montana House, state officials told her she could not use campaign money to pay for child care for her four young children.

She is now running for attorney general and is trying to visit a big chunk of the sprawling state, spending hours on the road. That means she needs even more help picking up her kids at school and day care when she's away and her husband has a late night at the office. (snip) Only six states have laws specifically allowing campaign money to be used for child care.

        Companies set up by members of a self-described and state-recognized Creek Indian tribe in Alabama have received more than $240 million in federal minority-business contracts, despite a determination by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs that there is no credible evidence the group has Native American ancestry, a Los Angeles Times investigation has found.

Federal contracts worth an additional $273 million have gone to two companies run by a member of a different Native American group in Alabama with no federal recognition as a tribe.

        Orthodox Jews around the country — and specifically in the tri-state area — were still reeling from the shooting at a kosher deli earlier this month when we gathered with our families to celebrate the holiday of Chanukah. But that air of tranquility was shattered by a string of nearly a dozen anti-Semitic attacks over the holiday, the most severe of which was a mass stabbing at a rabbi’s home upstate as he lit his menorah.

The stabbing attack succeeded in bringing to the fore what we visibly Orthodox Jews have known for quite some time: There’s a growing epidemic of anti-Semitism in this country, specifically targeting Orthodox Jews,

        PALM BEACH, Fla. — At the White House, people who want to meet with Donald Trump have to deal with schedulers, scores of aides hovering around the president and a strict security protocol.

At Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s luxury South Florida resort where he typically spends Christmas and New Year’s Eve, the president is just another guy in the buffet line.

        The reason the Founders put the Second Amendment in the Constitution, the document Democrats and liberals selectively embrace or read things into when convenient, was seen last Sunday at the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas, near Forth Worth where, dare we say it again, good guys with guns stopped a bad guy with a gun.  

Note the plural is used here, for video footage shows at least seven guns were drawn with seconds of the killer opening fire on the parishioners inside, killing two. But only two, as a wider massacre was stopped by those who don’t believe in gun-free zones.

        Sen. Mitt Romney’s 2012 super PAC formally shuttered this week, nearly eight years after his presidential campaign failed. 

Restore Our Future’s termination report filed with the Federal Election Commission formalizes the Utah Republican’s waning influence in the national GOP and may signal the lackluster fundraising potential of ‘Never Trump‘ Republicans in 2020.
