The restaurant is now an event destination called First Hill Gardens.\n\nThe numerous garden beds were covered in plastic or tarps in all stages of disintegration. Weeds had grown into the beds and irrigation tapes, cinder blocks, rebar and plastic trellis were strewn about. Four seasons of abandonment enabled the weeds to spread and the sun did a mighty fine job of breaking down some of the plastic covers.\n\nTo keep one's head above water, one bed at a time was focused upon. A quick peek under a tarp let this gardener know if the weeds were still out of control or if there was a possibility that the bed could be brought easily to life. Spring planting of potatoes and asparagus had to begin and by golly, a couple beds just had to be planted. So the work of transforming began - one garden bed at a time.\n\nThe task of lugging cinder blocks and gravel bags (disintegrating also!) began. Then the peeling back of the tarp and letting the earth underneath take a breath of spring air. No worms were visible, but soil that had received compost over the previous years was intact and it looked good! Figuring out the wild irrigation hoses and tapes was challenging, but in the end most were removed due to possible sun damage; other tapes were salvaged, tied up and stored. Raking and pulling weeds, tilling, spreading compost and soil amendments commenced. Then transplanting and mulching the asparagus babies and seed potatoes came next. Getting those beds planted was a major breakthrough; now the gardening season was really underway.\n\nBed, after bed. Day, after day. A small work party of six people attacked the 36 rotting cold frames and in threehours hauled them away. These naturally raised beds were kept as is and planted with flowers and vegetables. There was a path tilled down the middle and salt marsh hay was used as a mulch, over burlap in the paths. I was so sick of plastic and was/am trying to limit buying items made from or in plastic. I made a pledge that the First Hill Gardens were going to be natural and organic with limited use of plastic. It is challenging and I do understand why farmers and larger scale gardeners use plastic mulch, etc. I experimented with two types of burlap for weed control and the outcome is that the weave of the burlap has to be tight, with heavy warp and weft. Then doubling or tripling the fabric pretty much helps smother weeds. I am resorting to a heavy/deep mulch using only salt marsh hay with no burlap this coming season. Salt marsh hay has relatively no weed seed in it and looks and feels wonderful.\n\nSome days I did have help with edging, hauling heavy cinder blocks and weeding, and couldn't have managed without the help of my son and daughter. They were amazing! Persistence paid off and a beautiful overall garden evolved. Parsley, arugula, onions, marigolds, tomatoes, peppers, dahlias, corn, beans, strawflowers, amaranth, tulsi and peas grew despite damage from the pesty deer. Tobacco Hornworm and Japanese Beetles were in abundance - I think I picked 80 hornworms off the tomato plants and beetles loved the marigold flowers and roses. Having the earth worms reappear, plus Monarch butterflies and honeybees, was so gratifying and a wonderful gift. Birds, turkeys and, yes, deer, all showed up and life was teeming at First Hill Gardens this past 2019 gardening season. Looking forward to 2020 and the amazing possibilities in the garden beds at First Hill.\n\nI will \"leaf\" you with the following: a vision, persistence and hard work thrown together can move mountains or at least weeds on your dirt pathway of life. Happy New Year!\n\n\ufffd", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Martha Fenn King"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "2019 was a busy gardening season as Martha's Garden \"took on\" the old Arrows restaurant gardens that are a couple miles from the center of Ogunquit.
