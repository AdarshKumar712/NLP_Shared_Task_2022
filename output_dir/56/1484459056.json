Wallace, who practiced with a heavily taped right ankle, was upgraded to limited on Wednesday\u2019s injury report.\n\n\"He worked in there a little bit,'' coach Sean McDermott said. \"He\u2019s continuing to get better so we\u2019ll see how he does.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe availability of Wallace and Lawson for Saturday\u2019s wild-card playoff game at Houston would be a major boost for the Bills' defense facing dynamic quarterback Deshaun Watson and wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins.\n\nWallace has shared time with Kevin Johnson the last half of the season opposite Tre White in a Buffalo secondary that ranks fourth in the NFL against the pass.\n\nLawson, a fourth-year pro and former first-round pick, has had a career-best season with 6.5 sacks, 18 QB hits and 12 tackles for loss. He would play a critical role helping to keep the mobile Watson in the pocket.\n\nWallace was injured in the first quarter of last Sunday\u2019s loss to the New York Jets, falling awkwardly to the ground while making his second interception of the season. Lawson did not play against the Jets with his hamstring pull.\n\nNsekhe, who was splitting time with rookie Cody Ford at right tackle, had returned to action against the Jets after missing five games. He was doing extra work after practice.\n\nThe Bills have been among the NFL\u2019s healthiest teams in 2019. They entered Week 17 having used just 57 players, lowest since using 56 in 2008.\n\n\"We take a lot of time to go through schedules and make sure we\u2019re doing right by the players,'' said McDermott, who praised his training and medical staff. \"We work them, but we also try and have a feel for where they are and what they need. I can\u2019t tell you I've specifically been a part of something like this, but I know it's a good thing to stay healthy throughout the whole year.''\n\nLROTH@Gannett.com", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Availability of Wallace, Lawson would be boost for Bills facing Texans dynamic quarterback Deshaun Watson in Saturday's wild-card game", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Bills' Levi Wallace upgraded to 'limited,' status still unclear for Texans", "description": "Availability of Wallace, Lawson would be boost for Bills facing Texans dynamic quarterback Deshaun Watson in Saturday's wild-card game", "url": "https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/sports/football/nfl/bills/2020/01/01/levi-wallace-injury-shaq-lawson-injury-buffalo-bills-playoff-injury-report-bills-vs-texans/2790441001/", "site_name": "Democrat and Chronicle", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/12/29/PROC/816454c1-ac2c-4e06-a416-540ddcc8d5aa-JG_122919_Bills_10b.jpg?crop=4414,2483,x0,y161&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1801}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Leo Roth", "content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Availability of Wallace, Lawson would be boost for Bills facing Texans dynamic quarterback Deshaun Watson in Saturday's wild-card game", "fb": {"pages": 65299040658, "app_id": 176958652324613}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/12/29/PROC/816454c1-ac2c-4e06-a416-540ddcc8d5aa-JG_122919_Bills_10b.jpg?crop=4414,2483,x0,y161&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@DandC", "creator": "@DandC", "title": "Bills' Levi Wallace upgraded to 'limited,' status still unclear for Texans", "description": "Availability of Wallace, Lawson would be boost for Bills facing Texans dynamic quarterback Deshaun Watson in Saturday's wild-card game"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/sports/football/nfl/bills/2020/01/01/levi-wallace-injury-shaq-lawson-injury-buffalo-bills-playoff-injury-report-bills-vs-texans/2790441001/"}
