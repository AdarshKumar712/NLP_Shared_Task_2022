He then planned to play at the Australian Open, the year's first Grand Slam, from Jan. 20.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I have to pull out of the ATP Cup and the Aussie Open,\" Nishikori, who turned 30 on Sunday, wrote on his official app. \"Today, together with my team, we have made this decision.\"\n\nNishikori in November added former world No. 1 doubles player Max Mirnyi of Belarus to his coaching staff, with former French Open champ Michael Chang staying on to provide support in big tournaments.\n\n\"This decision was not taken lightly as Australia is one of my favorite places to compete. Together with my team, I will keep working hard to be back on the court as soon as possible. Thanks for all the support,\" he said.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nTennis: Kei Nishikori adds Max Mirnyi to coaching team\n\nTennis: Kei Nishikori has season-ending surgery on elbow\n\nTennis: Kei Nishikori splits from long-time coach Dante Bottini", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["kei nishikori", "japan tennis news", "nishikori australian open", "nishikori elbow surgery", "kei nishikori 2020", "kei nishikori official app"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Kyodo News"], "publish_date": "Sun Dec  8 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Kei Nishikori says he will miss next year's Australian Open as he is \"still not 100 percent\" ready or healthy to compete with the world's best following the right elbow surgery he underwent in October.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"csrf-token": "vWcqzqgXvDCsxRu7pqKfpOZRbDNyoj5xDQYIfdcm", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Kyodo News+", "keywords": "kei nishikori, japan tennis news, nishikori australian open, nishikori elbow surgery, kei nishikori 2020, kei nishikori official app", "description": "Kei Nishikori says he will miss next year's Australian Open as he is \"still not 100 percent\" ready or healthy to compete with the world's best following the right elbow surgery he underwent in October.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,minimum-scale=1.0", "block_download_image": 1, "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "application-name": "Kyodo News+", "author": "KYODO NEWS", "og": {"url": "https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2019/12/8867f0c0aa84-tennis-recovering-nishikori-to-miss-australian-open.html", "type": "article", "title": "Tennis: Recovering Kei Nishikori to miss Australian Open", "description": "Kei Nishikori says he will miss next year's Australian Open as he is \"still not 100 percent\" ready or healthy to compete with the world's best following the right elbow surgery he underwent in October.", "image": "https://img.kyodonews.net/english/public/images/posts/5143a71d9fc86d4c87ce87749c6e97e1/cropped_image_l.jpg", "site_name": "Kyodo News+", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kyodo_official", "url": "https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2019/12/8867f0c0aa84-tennis-recovering-nishikori-to-miss-australian-open.html", "title": "Tennis: Recovering Kei Nishikori to miss Australian Open", "description": "Kei Nishikori says he will miss next year's Australian Open as he is \"still not 100 percent\" ready or healthy to compete with the world's best following the right elbow surgery he underwent in October.", "image": "https://img.kyodonews.net/english/public/images/posts/5143a71d9fc86d4c87ce87749c6e97e1/cropped_image_l.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "canonical_link": "https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2019/12/8867f0c0aa84-tennis-recovering-nishikori-to-miss-australian-open.html"}
