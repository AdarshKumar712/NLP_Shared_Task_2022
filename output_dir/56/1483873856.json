Some have accused a prominent leader of abuse of power and instigating violence.\n\nPapy Sukami, the leader of one of the groups, says they are appealing to the City Of Cape Town and UNHCR to provide them with temporary accommodation.\n\n\u201cFour children last month, we have three or four children suffering from chickenpox right now in the church. We are homeless, we don\u2019t have anywhere to go. If they can provide any temporary accommodation where people can be safe in the meanwhile while we are waiting for the UN to come for the individual interview for the resettlement.\u201d\n\nSAHR to meet with refugees\n\nThe SA Human Rights Commission says a meeting will be held on Monday next week to find a solution to the crisis faced by foreign nationals in the Cape Town City Centre.\n\nHuman Rights Commissioner Chris Nissen says there\u2019s an urgent need to find a solution to the crisis faced by the foreign nationals before the matter is back in court on the 22nd of January.\n\nHe says the leaders of the foreign nations, the City of Cape Town, the Home Affairs department and the office of the UNHCR will meet on Monday to discuss alternative accommodation.\n\n\u201cPeople are desperate they say we thought we are going to be resettled, but it\u2019s not gonna happen, two weeks the schools are starting, we need to get those children to school, we will engage the leadership on these issues with all those stakeholders to ensure that there\u2019s protection for women and children the most vulnerable.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Cape Town", "Chickenpox", "South Africa", "Methodist Church", "Foreign nationals"], "authors": ["Celestine Hendricks", "Chris Mabuya"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 11:37:04 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/wp-content/themes/sabcnews/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "gCibvUv7H6HwT4yzAs_7HJwWERwfBU1EH03cm4xodpk", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Methodist Church refugees say 4 children died from chickenpox - SABC News - Breaking news, special reports, world, business, sport coverage of all South African current events.
