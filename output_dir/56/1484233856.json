The family has instructed Sussman to seek a mental health evaluation for Thomas.\n\nThe federal complaint paints a different picture of Thomas.\n\nBased on a court warrant approved Sunday, the FBI searched Thomas' home and his cellular telephone, finding references to Jews, Hitler, the Nazi culture, as well as packaging for an 18-inch machete, according to the complaint signed by FBI Special Agent Julie Brown.\n\nAgents also found among his journals drawings of a Star of David and a swastika, according to the complaint.\n\nThe hand-written journal removed from Thomas' house included references to \"Hebrew Israelites took from the powerful ppl\"; questioning \"why ppl mourned for anti-Semitism when there is Semitic genocide;\" referring to Adolf Hitler and Nazi culture on the same page as a drawings of a Star of David and a swastika.\n\nHis cell phone's internet browser included November and December searches for topics such as \"Why did Hitler hate the Jews, German Jewish Temples near me, Zionist Temples in Elizabeth, NJ, Zionist Temples of Staten Island, Prominent companies founded by Jews in America,\" according to the complaint.\n\nOn the day of the attack, Thomas' phone had a search for the article, \"New York City increases Police Presence in Jewish Neighborhoods After Possible Anti-Semitic Attacks. Here's What To Know.\" Your Email\n\nThe five federal charges include obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs involving an attempt to kill and use of a dangerous weapon and resulting in bodily injury.\n\nBrown's complaint details the attack, where dozens of Hasidic Jews celebrated the end of weekly Sabbath on Saturday night and the seventh night of Hanukkah.\n\n* Thomas, with his face covered with a scarf, entered the house on Dec. 28 at 9:52 p.m. declaring \"No one is leaving\" and started slashing and stabbing people. Five people suffered serious injuries, including a severed finger, slash wounds and deep cuts. A 70-year-old man suffered a fractured skull and remains in critical condition at the Westchester Medical Center with another man.\n\n* Thomas fled the house and one witness wrote down the license plate number of his vehicle. Police used databases containing license plate reader data,. The car crossed the George Washington Bridge from Fort Lee, N.J., into Manhattan at 11:07 p.m.\n\n* Two NYPD officers stopped the car at 11:49 p.m., detecting a strong smell of bleach and saw blood on Thomas' clothing. The officers arrested Thomas.\n\n* Police seized a machete from under the front passenger seat; the machete appeared to have dried blood; a knife with traces of dried blood and hair from the pocket of the rear of the front passenger seat; a cellular phone.\n\nSuspect on medication\n\nThomas was in federal court in White Plains for about 30 minutes Monday afternoon for an initial hearing where it was revealed he was taking two medications for bi-polar disorder and schizophrenia.\n\nHis court appointed attorney, Susanne Brody, said outside the courtroom she didn\u2019t know how long Thomas had been using the medications. Prosecutors requested Thomas remain detained on the federal charges, which was not contested by Brody.\n\nWhen answering questions from U.S. District Court Judge Paul Davison, Thomas, dressed in orange Rockland County Correctional Facility prison garb and with shackles on his ankles, said his head wasn\u2019t clear because he needed rest, but that he was coherent.\n\nThomas\u2019 next court appearance is Jan. 13.\n\nRamapo Police Chief Brad Weidel has been tight-lipped sharing details about Thomas and the investigation into the Hanukkah party attack on Saturday night. Weidel also has not expounded on the investigation into the pre-dawn Nov. 20 attack on a Monsey rabbi as he walked to a Howard Drive synagogue just after 5:30 a.m. for morning prayers. No one has been arrested in that knife attack and beating that seriously injured the 30-year-old father of four.\n\nRumors about the attack and its lack of a quick resolution have left the insular Hasidic Jewish community shaken.\n\nThomas is scheduled to appear Friday in Ramapo Justice Court on five charges of second-degree intentional attempted murder and a count of second-degree burglary.\n\nThe family's statement read, in part:\n\n\u201cGrafton Thomas has a long history of mental illness and hospitalizations. He has no history of violent acts and no convictions for any crime. He has no known history of anti-Semitism and was raised in a home which embraced and respected all religions and races. He is not a member of any hate groups.\u201d\n\nSussman, a noted civil rights attorney, is not handling the federal case. He sat in the audience on Monday as county officials and a security company publicized plans to provide extra protection for the Jewish community.\n\nSussman sat with Thomas' mother Kim, who wept hearing speakers call her son a coward and violent for the attack on Saturday night.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Steve Liebermanrockland Westchester Journal News"], "publish_date": "Mon Dec 30 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "MONSEY \u2014 A Greenwood Lake man accused in Ramapo of multiple attempted murder charges for seriously injuring five Orthodox Jews during a machete attack at a Saturday night Hanukkah party now faces federal hate crimes counts including attempted murder and violating the victims' religious rights.\r\nThe federal charges filed Monday include descriptions of Grafton Thomas' journal containing references to Nazism and to the Black Hebrew Israelites \u2014 the group linked to the fatal attack on a", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.recordonline.com/Global/images/favicons/recordonline_favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "recordonline.com", "title": "Orange County man charged with federal hate crimes", "description": "MONSEY \u2014 A Greenwood Lake man accused in Ramapo of multiple attempted murder charges for seriously injuring five Orthodox Jews during a machete", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.recordonline.com/storyimage/TH/20191230/NEWS/191239933/AR/0/AR-191239933.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 683}, "type": "article"}, "msvalidate.01": "7E15F9269E2CE66F2A488ABB04B5015E", "fb": {"pages": 18997066297}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1018726423?at=1000lkC&ct=sb-recordonline", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.gatehousemedia.id3007", "description": "MONSEY \u2014 A Greenwood Lake man accused in Ramapo of multiple attempted murder charges for seriously injuring five Orthodox Jews during a machete attack at a Saturday night Hanukkah party now faces federal hate crimes counts including attempted murder and violating the victims' religious rights.\r\nThe federal charges filed Monday include descriptions of Grafton Thomas' journal containing references to Nazism and to the Black Hebrew Israelites \u2014 the group linked to the fatal attack on a", "bt": {"pubDate": "20191230T13:09:39Z", "modDate": "20191230T13:09:00Z", "keywords": "ROCKLAND-COUNTY-STABBINGS", "author": "Steve LiebermanRockland/Westchester Journal News"}, "twitter": {"title": "Orange County man charged with federal hate crimes", "description": "MONSEY \u2014 A Greenwood Lake man accused in Ramapo of multiple attempted murder charges for seriously injuring five Orthodox Jews during a machete attack at a Saturday night Hanukkah party now faces federal hate crimes counts including attempted murder and violating the victims' religious rights.\r\nThe federal charges filed Monday include descriptions of Grafton Thomas' journal containing references to Nazism and to the Black Hebrew Israelites \u2014 the group linked to the fatal attack on a", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.recordonline.com/storyimage/TH/20191230/NEWS/191239933/AR/0/AR-191239933.jpg&MaxW=1200&MaxH=630", "site": "@recordonline"}, "author": "Steve LiebermanRockland/Westchester Journal News", "vf": {"unique_id": "siteTH-pub2330-CF5F1D89-5AE7-4FD2-A84A-204C4A676412"}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.recordonline.com/news/20191230/orange-county-man-charged-with-federal-hate-crimes"}
