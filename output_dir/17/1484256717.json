Sometimes sobering, at other times amusing, yet always somewhat inspiring if one considers what has been accomplished and what else is left to be done.\n\nA lot has been accomplished in the city. Many ongoing and new initiatives have been pushed forward and continue into the new year. Observing and participating in the machinations of municipal goings on, even at the most fundamental level, is something of a civic duty that we all should share a sense of responsibility for. It\u2019s what makes democracy great, that every man and woman makes a difference in what transpires, mainly when they express their viewpoints at the polls.\n\nLooking ahead to what may come in 2020, we can\u2019t help but feel optimistic about the days ahead. It will take some hard work and serious planning, but a lot can be accomplished if we pull together and focus on what\u2019s important.\n\nAs always, it\u2019s up to us to push things along in the right direction. To send the proper signals to our representatives in public office. To back them up when they get it right, and to call them on it when they seem to go astray. They have their duties and personal agendas, just as we have ours. Let each one carry on in the best way possible.\n\nIt is the time tested way of our community. We enjoy a uniquely favorable reputation as those who can.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.thesomervilletimes.com/wp-content/themes/whitehouse/core/images/favicon-pagelines.ico", "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 5.1.1", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "http://www.thesomervilletimes.com/archives/96325", "title": "Our View of the Times \u2013 January 1", "description": "Looking back to the year just passed is an interesting thing to do.
