Now feral hogs' rampant damage is stretching as far north as Canada, with particularly prominent populations in U.S. northern border states, including Montana and North Dakota, the New York Times reports.\n\n\"In the past 30 years, the hogs have expanded their range to 38 states from 17,\" according to the Times.\n\nAnd this spread isn't natural, it's being caused by people, scientists explain. Dale Nolte, manager of the feral swine program at the Department of Agriculture, told the outlet that there's \"every reason to believe they are being moved in the backs of pickup trucks and released to create hunting opportunities.\u201d\n\nNATURE ODDITIES: The weirdest Texas game warden stories of 2019\n\nWhile Texas has developed creative hunting practices to stave off the swine epidemic, from air balloon strikes to the \"HeliBacon,\" a helicopter that can be chartered for pricey hog-hunt excursions. However, for some states, hunting creates an incentive for hosting hog populations rather than a solution.\n\nIn those places, \"people to distribute feral pigs for sport,\" the Times explains. \"Hunting makes the animals warier and scatters sounders, or family groups, which go on to multiply in new family groups.\"\n\nThe swine have been capable of surviving the extreme winters in northern states and have been steadily multiplying. Their effects have not yet been as carefully documented as they are in the south. What experts do know is that state officials should plan to contain hog populations sooner rather than later.\n\nThis rings especially true and urgent in recent months.\n\nThese hogs are not typically known to be predatory, but a November encounter proved deadly for a woman in Anahuac, Texas. Christine Rollins was found dead with animal bites on her body. The Jefferson County Coroner's Office determined it was a feral hog assault that caused Rollin's death. However, that's an extreme and rare example of what these swine can do. If they cause human casualties it's usually by spreading disease through contaminated waters, including E. coli outbreaks in produce.\n\nHUNTING: Culberson County mule deer buck could be record-breaker\n\nIt's more common that the invasive species attacks ecosystems rather than people. They destabilize habitats and ravage private properties, agricultural crops \u2014 to the tune of $52 million in one recent finding \u2014and wetlands by trampling on them. Even worse, they breed quickly. Their gestation period is roughly 120 days and they can breed as young as six months old.\n\nBecause of their negative effects on the environment and on communities, officials in The Woodlands \u2014 where this issue is particularly pronounced \u2014 are hosting an educational seminar on Feb. 20 at Houston Advanced Research Center (HARC), 8801 Gosling Road, in The Woodlands. The lecture will discuss how to tackle the growing problem and will feature guest speaker Chris Watts, a wildlife damage management biologist with the Texas A&M University AgriLife Extension and the Texas Wildlife Services Program.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Darla Guillen Gilthorpe", "Houston Chronicle"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 13:01:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "ispremium": 0, "dc.date": "2020-01-01T19:01:13Z", "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T19:01:13Z", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T19:55:34Z", "opinion": "false"}, "SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "news_keywords": "Dale Nolte, Christine Rollins, Chris Watts, Rollin, Texas, Canada, The Woodlands, U.S., North Dakota, Montana, Anahuac, Gosling Road, Culberson County, Jefferson County Coroner's Office, Department of Agriculture, New York Times, Texas Wildlife Services Program, Houston Advanced Research Center, Texas A&amp, NATURE ODDITIES, HeliBacon, M University AgriLife Extension", "nlpOrganization": "Jefferson County Coroner's Office, Department of Agriculture, New York Times, Texas Wildlife Services Program, Houston Advanced Research Center, Texas A&amp", "nlpPerson": "Dale Nolte, Christine Rollins, Chris Watts, Rollin", "nlpLocation": "Texas, Canada, The Woodlands, U.S., North Dakota, Montana, Anahuac, Gosling Road, Culberson County", "nlpOther": "NATURE ODDITIES, HeliBacon, M University AgriLife Extension", "nlpCategories": "%2FHobbies+%26+Leisure,%2FPets+%26+Animals%2FWildlife", "sailthru.title": "Feral hogs, a familiar Texas pest, are roaming north", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-01 13:01:00 -0600", "sailthru.author": "Darla Guillen Gilthorpe, Houston Chronicle", "sailthru_type": "article", "sailthru_uid": 14943508, "sailthru_section": "news", "sailthru_pubname": "houston-chronicle", "sailthru_siteid": 21, "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/07/52/50/18786869/7/sailthruImage.jpg", "og": {"title": "Feral hogs, a familiar Texas pest, are roaming north", "description": "Texas has long faced the destruction feral hogs can have on land and wildlife.
