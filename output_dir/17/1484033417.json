provisional release during the ongoing investigation.\n\nRabat \u2013 The public prosecutor at the Marrakech Court of First Instance has formally appealed the decision of the investigating judge to grant Moroccan singer Dounia Batma and her sister provisional release on bail.\n\nAn investigating judge ordered the release of Dounia and her sister on bail after their indictment for alleged involvement in the \u201cHamza mon bb\u201d case.\n\nThe Hamza mon bb case involves accounts active on social media on Snapchat and Instagram, posting videos and photos about celebrities and influencers for blackmail.\n\nThe prosecutor at the court of appeal has contested the court\u2019s decision to release Dounia and Ibtissam Batma on bail.\n\nThe singer and her sister paid MAD 500,000 each to be released during the ongoing investigation.\n\nRead Also: Dounia Batma Appears Laughing in Video After Release on Bail\n\nThe sisters are facing serious charges, including defamation, blackmail, and sharing people\u2019s statements and photos without their consent.\n\nThey could both face to five years in prison if convicted.\n\nNational judicial police in Marrakech transferred Dounia Batma and her sister Ibtissam to the Public Prosecutor in Marrakech for further investigation on Monday, December 30.\n\nThe Batma sisters are not allowed to leave Moroccan territory before the end of the investigation while the investigation remains ongoing.\n\nPolice also seized Dounia\u2019s phone, currently subject to technical examinations to determine any links between the two sisters
