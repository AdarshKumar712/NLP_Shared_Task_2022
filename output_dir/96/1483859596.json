The lawsuit also alleged negligent supervision of Sands by the company.\n\nMcGrane admitted a sexual relationship between Sands and the employee, but said he and TU Dance denied the \"sexual misconduct\" alleged in the lawsuit. Feeling the suit would be a distraction to the company, Sands offered his resignation Monday, McGrane said.\n\nUri Sands and Toni Pierce Sands of TU Dance in 2014. JOELKOYAMA jkoyama@startribune\n\nAttorney Jeff Anderson, who is representing the woman \u2014 a former dancer with the company who is not named in the suit \u2014 said Sands \"sexually exploited\" her, and he characterized the alleged misconduct as \"nonconsensual sexual intercourse.\"\n\nMcGrane also said that in 2017, TU Dance received an anonymous complaint involving Sands that resulted in the adoption of a sexual harassment policy by the company and a policy that Sands could not travel alone with female dancers. She said Sands was asked to engage in counseling and therapy, which he did.\n\nTU Dance was founded in 2004 by Uri Sands (the \"U\" in \"TU\") and Toni Pierce-Sands (the \"T\"). Both made their mark with the New York-based Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, one of the nation's leading troupes. They married in 2001.\n\nIn July 2005, they premiered their multicultural dance company to sold-out audiences at the Southern Theater in Minneapolis. The Star Tribune named the couple its Artists of the Year that December, lauding them for \"seamlessly melding African, modern, ballet and vernacular dance styles, underscored by a rhythmic musicality.\"\n\nOn the company's 10th anniversary in 2014, it received a $500,000 Knight Foundation grant to help it add programming, expand its funding base and help diversify the local dance scene. \"What will we be in the next 10 years?\" Pierce-Sands told the Star Tribune that year. \"We'll be taking dance from St. Paul to the world.\"\n\nIn 2018 it collaborated with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver on an evening-long work titled \"Come Through,\" which has since toured to major venues across the nation, including the Hollywood Bowl and the Kennedy Center in Washington, and Brooklyn just three weeks ago.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Richard Chin", "Richard.Chin Startribune.Com"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Uri Sands stepped down after a former employee's allegation.
