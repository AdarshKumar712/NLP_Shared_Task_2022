The couple took their fight to the Supreme Court, the highest court in Britain, forcing the law change.\n\nSteinfeld told journalists it was their personal wish to form a civil partnership which came from a personal desire to formalise their relationship in a more modern way, with a focus in equality and mutual respect. She said it creates new, modern possibilities for thousands of people to express their love and commitment and ends the unrivaled position of marriage.\n\nThe change means couples will be able to access the same tax benefits, pensions and inheritances as those available to married couples.\n\nThe government said thousands of civil ceremonies were taking place across England and Wales Tuesday as the new rules came into operation.\n\nA spokesperson for the Government Equalities Office said: \"Civil partnerships are not intended to compete with marriage but rather to provide an alternative option for those couples who do not wish to marry but want legal certainty and stability for their families.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["UK", "live-in relationships", "Rebecca Steinfeld", "Charles Keidan"], "tags": ["live-in relationships", "UK", "Rebecca Steinfeld", "Charles Keidan"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "This morning Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan registered their 'more modern' partnership at Kensington and Chelsea Register", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "UK,live-in relationships,Rebecca Steinfeld,Charles Keidan", "description": "This morning Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan registered their 'more modern' partnership at Kensington and Chelsea Register", "title": "Legal fig leaf for UK live-in relationships", "keywords": "UK,live-in relationships,Rebecca Steinfeld,Charles Keidan", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/world/legal-fig-leaf-for-uk-live-in-relationships", "title": "Legal fig leaf for UK live-in relationships", "image": {"identifier": "https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2020-01%2Fad51fe1e-58cc-4ce2-adbf-7a6c5eaacccb%2FRebecca_Steinfeld.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C1314%2C690&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "site_name": "Latest Indian news, Top Breaking headlines, Today Headlines, Top Stories at Free Press Journal"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Legal fig leaf for UK live-in relationships", "image": "https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2020-01%2Fad51fe1e-58cc-4ce2-adbf-7a6c5eaacccb%2FRebecca_Steinfeld.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C1314%2C739&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true", "creator": "Agencies", "site": "Latest Indian news, Top Breaking headlines, Today Headlines, Top Stories at Free Press Journal", "domain": "https://www.freepressjournal.in"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2254637581419855, "pages": 178566438825717}, "viewport": "width=device-width,height=device-height,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=2.0,minimum-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/world/legal-fig-leaf-for-uk-live-in-relationships"}
