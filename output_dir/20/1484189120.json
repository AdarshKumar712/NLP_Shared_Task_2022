Wiesenthal Center called on the White House to direct the FBI to form a task force to focus exclusively on anti-Semitism following the stabbings in Monsey, N.Y.\n\nWiesenthal Center founder and Dean Rabbi Marvin Hier and Associate Dean and Director of Global Social Action Agenda said in a Dec. 28 statement, \u201cEnough is enough! Jews should not have to fear for their lives in America to go to their houses of worship. The FBI must step up and take the lead in all recent violent hate crimes targeting religious Jews.\u201d\n\nHier told the Journal in a phone interview that the Dec. 28 Monsey stabbings that resulted in five injured reminded him of Nazi Germany in the 1930s. \u201cJews were beaten up on the corner. Windows were broken \u2026 that\u2019s how it started,\u201d Hier said. \u201cAnd the population centers tolerated it. Nobody spoke out against it; we didn\u2019t have a plan against it.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the rise of anti-Semitism in the United States has become such an epidemic that more action is needed beyond statements and pledges from state and local politicians and police officers. \u201cThey\u2019re all good people, but they\u2019re not 24/7 on this job,\u201d Hier said. \u201cThey have other jobs. Even police, they have traffic issues. \u2026 There are so many issues besides the issue of anti-Semitism [that they have to deal with].\u201d\n\nHier added that it\u2019s important to ensure that politics doesn\u2019t interfere with addressing anti-Semitism. \u201cWhen you have a Democratic mayor and a Republican governor or vice versa, it\u2019s a different attitude,\u201d Hier said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the right way to handle an epidemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need the FBI to create a special unit focusing 24/7, 365 days a year on one subject: anti-Semitism.\u201d \u2014 Marvin Hier\n\nHe also argued that people shouldn\u2019t expect anti-Semitism to dissipate with the election of a new president or a new Congress. \u201cWhen the whole world is affected by the epidemic called anti-Semitism \u2014 and this has happened in Europe for the last 15 years \u2014 you cannot legitimately argue that the cause of it in the United States is due to one man,\u201d Hier said without naming President Donald Trump.\n\nAn FBI task force that is exclusively focused on handling anti-Semitism is therefore necessary to address the rising anti-Semitism throughout the country, he argued. \u201cWe need the FBI to create a special unit focusing 24/7, 365 days a year on one subject: anti-Semitism,\u201d Hier said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way that the anti-Semites will wake up because basically they\u2019re going to be targeted, they\u2019re going to be analyzed.\u201d\n\nHier gave a hypothetical of how the task force would handle an anti-Semitic incident. \u201cLet\u2019s say there\u2019s an attack here in Los Angeles,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst thing that happens is that everything about the attack is sent immediately to the FBI task force on anti-Semitism. And they become the lead agency. They take over immediately.\u201d\n\nHier said that the Wiesenthal Center has been in contact with the White House about its proposal for a task force.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is aware of it,\u201d Hier said. \u201cHe\u2019s been informed of it. \u2026 We\u2019ll see what happens. We are pushing very hard. We need bipartisan support.\u201d\n\nHier urged for a societal unification against anti-Semitism, as he argued that anti-Semitism is emboldened when societies ignore it.\n\n\u201cSociety didn\u2019t do the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t recognize that these bigots can return early, and as society, we have to have a program against it, and the program has to unify Democrats and Republicans [and] whatever their political persuasion in Europe. We have to come together to fight this.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["David Suissa", "Dan Schnur", "Eva Robbins", "Rachel Fish", "Lorelei Laird", "Debra Nussbaum Cohen", "Daniel Greenfield", "Natalie Solomon", "Shmuel Rosner", "Sharla Etkin-Ives"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:31:01 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Simon Wiesenthal Center called on the White House to direct the FBI to form a task force to focus exclusively on anti-Semitism following the stabbings", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://jewishjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-jjlogo6214_512-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 1376757982393206}, "author": "BY <a href='https://jewishjournal.com/author/'></a>", "description": "The Simon Wiesenthal Center called on the White House to direct the FBI to form a task force to focus exclusively on anti-Semitism following the stabbings", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Wiesenthal Center Calls for FBI Task Force to Deal with Anti-Semitism | Jewish Journal", "description": "The Simon Wiesenthal Center called on the White House to direct the FBI to form a task force to focus exclusively on anti-Semitism following the stabbings", "url": "https://jewishjournal.com/news/nation/309033/wiesenthal-center-calls-for-fbi-task-force-to-deal-with-anti-semitism/", "site_name": "Jewish Journal", "image": {"identifier": "https://jewishjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/800px-White_House_DC.jpeg", "secure_url": "https://jewishjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/800px-White_House_DC.jpeg", "width": 800, "height": 483}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/JewishJournal/", "section": "Nation", "published_time": "2020-01-01T00:31:01+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Simon Wiesenthal Center called on the White House to direct the FBI to form a task force to focus exclusively on anti-Semitism following the stabbings", "title": "Wiesenthal Center Calls for FBI Task Force to Deal with Anti-Semitism | Jewish Journal", "site": "@JewishJournal", "image": "https://jewishjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/800px-White_House_DC.jpeg", "creator": "@bandlersbanter"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://jewishjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-jjlogo6214_512-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://jewishjournal.com/news/nation/309033/wiesenthal-center-calls-for-fbi-task-force-to-deal-with-anti-semitism/"}
