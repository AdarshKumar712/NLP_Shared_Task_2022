They will instead have access to the company\u2019s nicotine cessation program to help them quit smoking.\n\nLopez said the new policy is part of U-Haul\u2019s efforts to establish one of the healthiest corporate cultures in the United States and Canada. The company has a \u201cHealthier You\u201d program launched in 2016 to help employees in four areas: health, mindset, nutrition and fitness.\n\n\u201cEach year it has been our mission to increase our wellness benefits program\u2019s resources to help the needs of all team members and families to conquer their health goals,\u201d she said. \u201cThis nicotine/tobacco-free hiring policy is the next step.\u201d\n\nThe new policy also comes after U-Haul broke ground on a new conference and fitness center at its Midtown campus near Central Avenue and 3rd Street in Phoenix.\n\nWhen it\u2019s completed in December 2020, the center will house a medical clinic, a full-size basketball court, a two-lane track, and cardio and weightlifting equipment, among other amenities.\n\n\u201cIf we take care of our team members, they take care of our business,\u201d Lopez said.\n\nFollow @GriseldaZetino", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Phoenix and Arizona Breaking News And News Headlines - Home", "Home", "92.3 KTAR"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Griselda Zetino"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 21:30:09 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Starting in February, the do-it-yourself moving company headquartered in Phoenix will no longer hire nicotine users in Arizona and 20 other states.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Phoenix and Arizona Breaking News And News Headlines - Home, Home,92.3 KTAR", "verify-v1": "XrJiQDsWmPaoqGKN0EHKs7ult0rBB0W9zj4cWkAPRVI=", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=719630055", "fb": {"pages": 42794977621}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.jacobsmedia.KTAR", "description": "Starting in February, the do-it-yourself moving company headquartered in Phoenix will no longer hire nicotine users in Arizona and 20 other states.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Phoenix moving company U-Haul will no longer hire nicotine users", "description": "Starting in February, the do-it-yourself moving company headquartered in Phoenix will no longer hire nicotine users in Arizona and 20 other states.", "url": "https://ktar.com/story/2900558/phoenix-moving-company-u-haul-will-no-longer-hire-nicotine-users/", "site_name": "KTAR.com", "updated_time": "2019-12-31T20:37:49+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/u-haul-nicotine-free.png", "secure_url": "https://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/u-haul-nicotine-free.png", "width": 620, "height": 370}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KTARNews", "tag": "U-Haul", "section": "Arizona News", "published_time": "2019-12-31T21:30:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-12-31T20:37:49+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Starting in February, the do-it-yourself moving company headquartered in Phoenix will no longer hire nicotine users in Arizona and 20 other states.", "title": "Phoenix moving company U-Haul will no longer hire nicotine users", "site": "@ktar923", "image": "https://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/u-haul-nicotine-free.png", "creator": "@GriseldaZetino"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 0.9.97.63"}, "canonical_link": "https://ktar.com/story/2900558/phoenix-moving-company-u-haul-will-no-longer-hire-nicotine-users/"}
