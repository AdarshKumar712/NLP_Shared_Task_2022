For Khurrana, 2019 has not only been a dream run at the box office, but also as a celebrity brand endorser for those trying to reach out to the guy next door.Khurrana, who has given seven back-to-back hits, including ' Andhadhun ', which fetched a National Film Award for best actor, is now the face of 15 brands -from eyewear (Titan) to watches (Daniel Wellington), and clothing (Turtle) to men\u2019s grooming (The Man Company). He has also signed four more brand endorsement deals that will be disclosed early next year. What clicks with Khurrana is his very high 'Emulatability' score, as per Indian Institute of Human Brands (IIHB).Emulatability is an amalgam of people liking or loving the celebrity, respecting him, identifying with him or wanting to be like him. \u201cAyushmann\u2019s clever choice of reel roles has made him score very high on 'identify' with, besides the other parameters of \u2018he is like me; if not, I would like to be like him\u2019. He has easy familiarity and seems to be friendly and fun, affable and authentic. Hence, his movies are doing well, and he is in demand with brands,\u201d said Sandeep Goyal, veteran adman and chief mentor of IIHB.Another important dimension behind the increase in Khurrana\u2019s brand salience, as per Goyal, is that unlike most celebrities, he is not distant and forbidding. \"So, his relatability is very high, contributing to him being seen as 'endearing'.\u201d Industry estimates put Khurrana\u2019s combined earnings at around Rs 35 crore in 2019. He, however, says that all commercial interests are looked after by the YRF Talent team. \u201cI am very bad with numbers, so endorsements and deals are looked after by the team. What I focus on is whether or not the ethos of the company I am endorsing is similar to mine,\u201d Khurrana told ET. This, he added, was the main reason why he picked up stake in the Man Company. \u201cI am sure that I will not advertise for any fairness cream or tobacco or pan masala products, ever,\u201d he added.Khurrana has cemented his position in the industry as the poster boy of content cinema doing diverse films with relatable and relevant stories, be it his debut film \u2018 Vicky Donor \u2019, where he played the role of a sperm donor, or his latest film, \u2018Bala\u2019, where he played role of a young man suffering from male pattern baldness. \u201cI am just fortunate to work with incredible script writers, directors and producers,\u201d he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Yash Raj Films", "andhadhun", "ADS", "Vicky Donor", "ayushmann khurrana"], "tags": ["ayushmann khurrana", "Ayushmann Khurrana", "andhadhun", "Yash Raj Films", "Andhadhun", "Vicky Donor", "ADS"], "authors": ["Gaurav Laghate"], "publish_date": "Mon Dec 30 08:28:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "For Khurrana, 2019 has not only been a dream run at the box office, but also as a celebrity brand endorser for those trying to reach out to the guy next door.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/icons/etfavicon.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "For Khurrana, 2019 has not only been a dream run at the box office, but also as a celebrity brand endorser for those trying to reach out to the guy next door.", "news_keywords": "industry news,industry growth,indian industry news,Yash Raj Films,andhadhun,ADS,Vicky Donor,ayushmann khurrana", "keywords": "Yash Raj Films,andhadhun,ADS,Vicky Donor,ayushmann khurrana", "fb": {"app_id": 128738260476079, "admins": 556964827, "pages": 21540067693}, "og": {"title": "'Endearing' Ayushmann Khurrana is the new favourite of advertisers now", "site_name": "The Economic Times", "type": "article", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/advertising/endearing-ayushmann-khurrana-is-the-new-favourite-of-advertisers-now/articleshow/73023981.cms", "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-73023987,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-213882,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "description": "For Khurrana, 2019 has not only been a dream run at the box office, but also as a celebrity brand endorser for those trying to reach out to the guy next door."}, "article": {"published_time": "2019-12-30T08:28:00.000Z", "tag": "ayushmann khurrana", "modified_time": "2019-12-30T08:28:00.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "etapp://articleshow/73023981", "app_store_id": 474766725, "app_name": "The Economic Times App"}, "android": {"url": "etandroidapp://articleshow/73023981", "com": "com.et.reader.activities", "app_name": "The Economic Times"}}, "website": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/", "object_type": "website", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@EconomicTimes", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/advertising/endearing-ayushmann-khurrana-is-the-new-favourite-of-advertisers-now/articleshow/73023981.cms", "title": "'Endearing' Ayushmann Khurrana is the new favourite of advertisers now", "description": "For Khurrana, 2019 has not only been a dream run at the box office, but also as a celebrity brand endorser for those trying to reach out to the guy next door.", "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-73023987,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-213882,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "app": {"country": "IN", "name": {"iphone": "The Economic Times App", "googleplay": "The Economic Times App"}, "id": {"iphone": 474766725, "googleplay": "com.et.reader.activities"}, "url": {"iphone": "etapp://articleshow/73023981", "googleplay": "etandroidapp://articleshow/73023981"}}}}, "canonical_link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/advertising/endearing-ayushmann-khurrana-is-the-new-favourite-of-advertisers-now/articleshow/73023981.cms"}
