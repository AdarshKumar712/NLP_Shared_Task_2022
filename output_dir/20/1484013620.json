This year\u2019s event will give a nod to the famous fictional spy James Bond.\n\nThe symphony will be playing James Bond themes with singers from the Mepro Music Production company in Vienna, Austria. The company has been licensed to create several shows including The Music of Bond. Other shows in its repertoire include the music of John Williams, magical moments with music from Harry Potter movies and another show based on the music of romantic movies.\n\nThe music will be familiar to 007 fans. Some of the Bond songs that will be in the concert include the theme from \u201cDiamonds Are Forever,\u201d \u201cSkyfall\u201d and \u201cGoldfinger.\u201d There will also be instrumental selections.\n\nMurray said there will be a few film clips shown during parts of the concert.\n\nNot only will there be the music of Bond, but there will be other Bond touches throughout the night.\n\nThe event begins at 6 p.m. with a reception with light hors d\u2019oeuvres and an open bar. Patrons can imbibe Bond\u2019s famous \u201cshaken not stirred\u201d martini, the Vesper. The concert will begin at 7:30 p.m.\n\nThere are two levels of support. Platinum is $250 per person, and gold is $175 per person. Platinum supporters will receive valet parking and will be guests at an after party in the Knox Music Institute. The after party will feature \u201cindulgent\u201d hors d\u2019oeuvres, full bar and an immersive Bond experience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really great event,\u201d said Murray who added that the committee has a few secrets that members haven\u2019t even shared with her yet.\n\nMurray said the black-tie fundraiser has taken the place of multiple smaller events throughout the year. Attendance has been high for the past couple of years as the community has rallied around the renovated Miller Theater. She hopes for similar attendance this year and said that supporters will be in for a memorable night.\n\nTickets for the gala are available through the Augusta Symphony\u2019s website, augustasymphony.com, or at the Miller Theater Box Office at (706) 842-4080.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Charmain Z.
