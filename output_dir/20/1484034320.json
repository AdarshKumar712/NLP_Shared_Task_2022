With film clips, they\u2019ll point out nuances of calls, techniques and how they fit into the larger design of a particular play\n\nBut there is one number no one can quibble with: availability.\n\nEither someone plays, or they don\u2019t.\n\nKevin King did not shy away from that at the end of 2018, his second straight campaign that concluded on injured reserve. He didn\u2019t hide from it personally, internally on the team or publicly with the media.\n\n\u201cOne of his goals, like everybody else writing down their goals, his goal was to play,\u201d Packers secondary coach Jason Simmons said. \u201cHe wanted to play all 16 and then what happens after that.\u201d\n\nA career-high 15 games later \u2014 the exact number King played his previous two years combined \u2014 and with the playoffs looming, the 24-year-old cornerback and the Packers can say that ownership he took in the offseason and throughout the regular season returned a high yield.\n\n\u201cIt definitely had paid off just in terms of that, in terms of being healthy throughout the year, being available for my team in that aspect,\u201d King said. \u201cWith that being said, I still have a ways to go. Still have things in your routine that you try to refine each and every year. You just gotta stay on it. Sometimes when you see a result people tend to say OK, that\u2019s it. Just gotta keep adding to it, keep building.\u201d\n\nTeammate Jaire Alexander trained with King in the offseason, seeing first hand the foundational work King put into a body that had been beaten up in 685 defensive snaps over 2017 and 2018.\n\nGreen Bay Packers cornerback Kevin King (20) and Detroit Lions wide receiver Chris Lacy (15) wait on the snap during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Dec. 29, 2019, in Detroit.

King played 805, according to the Pro Football Focus analytics service .\n\n\u201cKev has been real focused, real determined to go out there and make a name for himself,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI think he\u2019s done a real good job, for real. Just to see his availability last year, the year before, and for him to come out and play as much as he did and making a big impact for our defense and our secondary, that\u2019s exciting to see. But he put in a lot of work.\u201d\n\nThe work translated to game days, during which he had a career-high five interceptions. That total tied him (with eight other players) for fourth in the NFL, one shy of the league lead (shared by three players). He also finished with 56 tackles and a team-high 15 pass breakups (tied for ninth in the league).\n\n\u201cThe Kevin King kid, he\u2019s a good player,\u201d said an opposing offensive coach who game-planned for the Packers in 2019. \u201cHe\u2019s not someone we were scared of or anything like that, but we definitely had respect for him. He\u2019s a good, high-level corner in the league.\u201d\n\nPro Football Focus graded King out essentially in the middle of all cornerbacks in 2019, his 62.5 rating checking at No. 68 of 125 graded players at his position. The grade was a career-high, however, and his completion percentage allowed and quarterback rating in his direction compared favorably with Alexander's.\n\nBut, King and Simmons were quick to acknowledge it wasn\u2019t the steadiest of seasons.\n\n\u201cI think it showed flashes,\u201d King said of his play. \u201cI definitely showed flashes. Now I gotta be more consistent.\u201d\n\nAccording to PFF, King\u2019s coverage had its peaks and valleys with just a handful of steady games in-between.\n\nHis highest grades were:\n\nPhiladelphia (90.3)\n\nMinnesota in Week 16 (83.7)\n\nOakland (82.7)\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (75.7)\n\nMinnesota in Week 2 (74.5)\n\nCarolina (70.2)\n\nHis lowest were:\n\nDetroit in Week 6 (27.9)\n\nSan Francisco (36.3)\n\nDenver (37.7)\n\nKansas City (43.4)\n\nDallas (45.3)\n\nThat's to be expected to a degree, considering how infrequently King played his first two years.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got some ups, he\u2019s got some downs, but the deal is though, we\u2019re a better football team when Kevin King dresses,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cSo we\u2019re happy to see it.\u201d\n\nAfter injuring his right hamstring in early August, King essentially missed a month before returning to practice a few days before the opener in Chicago on Sept. 5.\n\nSince then he has been listed with hamstring, chest, groin, knee and shoulder injuries and an illness. He missed only three practices, however, and was limited only 16 times. In four weeks he did not appear on the injury report at all. He was doubtful with a groin injury before the game in Dallas but played and was held out of the Washington game for precautionary reasons.\n\nNow, as he prepares for his first playoff game in the NFC divisional round Jan. 12 \u2014 and the most football he has played in one season in his life \u2014 he feels like the start of 2020 will be his best to date.\n\n\u201cYes, sir. Yes, sir. I definitely feel good,\u201d King said. \u201cI feel I\u2019m healthy. No major issues. And got time to take care of the minor things. But yeah, I feel good. The past few weeks I\u2019ve felt very comfortable and that\u2019s huge going into this playoff run. Just that mental stability. That\u2019s a big part of playing corner, is confidence and just believing in yourself. Even if a guy beats you one time, just sticking to your technique. Things like that are huge. The mentality is huge.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jim Owczarski", "Published A.M.
