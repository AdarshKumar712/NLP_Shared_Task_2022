Keller, a lawyer for Spacey, said in an email Tuesday night. \u201cThe plaintiff wished to dismiss the case and we stipulated to the dismissal to speed things up. What you see in the stipulation is all there is to see. Any reports to the contrary are false.\u201d\n\n(The Hollywood Reporter said Tuesday that a \u201csettlement\u201d had prompted the conclusion of the case.)\n\nA lawyer for the estate of the massage therapist, a Los Angeles County man identified in the lawsuit as John Doe, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening.\n\nThe massage therapist sued Spacey, 60, last January. He accused Spacey of grabbing his hand and putting it on the actor\u2019s genitals during a massage at a home in Malibu, Calif., that had been rented by Spacey\u2019s production company. The lawsuit claimed that Spacey groped and tried to kiss the massage therapist before offering him oral sex.\n\nBut the massage therapist died in September at 62, leaving his estate 90 days to take over as the plaintiff in the lawsuit. In November, a California Superior Court judge signed an order appointing the man\u2019s son as the special administrator of his estate.\n\nThe case\u2019s conclusion came less than a week after Ari Behn, a Scandinavian writer who had accused Spacey of groping him, died by suicide, according to the Norwegian news service NTB.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nSpacey\u2019s acting career, which includes a pair of Oscars, all but vanished after several people accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\nMassachusetts prosecutors dropped a sexual assault charge against Spacey in July after a young man who had accused the actor of fondling him at a Nantucket restaurant three years earlier, when he was 18, refused to testify about whether he had deleted cellphone evidence. The accuser also withdrew a lawsuit against Spacey six days after filing it.\n\nIn another case, Spacey apologized for what he said \u201cwould have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour\u201d after actor Anthony Rapp made an accusation about his sexual conduct with him 31 years ago, when Rapp was 14.\n\nDirector Ridley Scott replaced Spacey with Christopher Plummer in \u201cAll the Money in the World,\u201d about the 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty III and his grandfather\u2019s refusal to pay a $17-million (U.S.) ransom. Scott reshot 22 scenes that Spacey had appeared in with Plummer.\n\nNetflix halted production on \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d \u2014 the series later resumed without Spacey \u2014 and abandoned \u201cGore,\u201d a completed film starring Spacey as Gore Vidal.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["movies", "Kevin spacey", "sexual lawsuit", "Spacey accuser", "Spacey massage therapist", "smg_entertainment"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Neil Vigdor", "The New York Times"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A Los Angeles County massage therapist, who died in September, had accused Spacey of groping him and making improper advances during a 2016 massage.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon-thestar.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicon-thestar-144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicon-thestar-70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicon-thestar-150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicon-thestar-310.png", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=379481068", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "thestar.com", "application-name": "thestar.com", "fb": {"pages": 134392236659479}, "robots": "noindex,nofollow", "storyuuid": "18b05720-2533-4a4a-a762-c4f0308b2bd6", "description": "A Los Angeles County massage therapist, who died in September, had accused Spacey of groping him and making improper advances during a 2016 massage.", "keywords": "movies,Kevin spacey,sexual lawsuit,Spacey accuser,Spacey massage therapist,smg_entertainment", "news_keywords": "movies,Kevin spacey,sexual lawsuit,Spacey accuser,Spacey massage therapist,smg_entertainment", "article": {"published": "2020-01-01", "modified": "2020-01-01", "section": "Entertainment", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/torontostar"}, "thumbnail": "https://images.thestar.com/bXB2ydWgDpKE5lC_f9-DrkpsMKc=/93x66/smart/filters:cb(1577911551961)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/entertainment/2020/01/01/kevin-spacey-accusers-estate-drops-sexual-assault-lawsuit/spacey.jpg", "og": {"title": "Kevin Spacey accuser\u2019s estate drops sexual assault lawsuit | The Star", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2020/01/01/kevin-spacey-accusers-estate-drops-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html", "site_name": "thestar.com", "description": "A Los Angeles County massage therapist, who died in September, had accused Spacey of groping him and making improper advances during a 2016 massage.", "image": "https://images.thestar.com/Rd6W49GOCEy9CTneHawWuFbV8HE=/1200x856/smart/filters:cb(1577911551961)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/entertainment/2020/01/01/kevin-spacey-accusers-estate-drops-sexual-assault-lawsuit/spacey.jpg"}, "bt": {"url": "https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2020/01/01/kevin-spacey-accusers-estate-drops-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html", "author": "Neil Vigdor", "id": "18b05720-2533-4a4a-a762-c4f0308b2bd6", "pubDate": 1577892947969, "modDate": 1577911554230, "type": "Story", "dateDisplay": "Wed., Jan. 1, 2020"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TorontoStar", "title": "Kevin Spacey accuser\u2019s estate drops sexual assault lawsuit | The Star", "description": "A Los Angeles County massage therapist, who died in September, had accused Spacey of groping him and making improper advances during a 2016 massage.", "image": "https://images.thestar.com/Rd6W49GOCEy9CTneHawWuFbV8HE=/1200x856/smart/filters:cb(1577911551961)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/entertainment/2020/01/01/kevin-spacey-accusers-estate-drops-sexual-assault-lawsuit/spacey.jpg", "creator": "Neil Vigdor"}, "parsely-title": "Kevin Spacey accuser\u2019s estate drops sexual assault lawsuit", "parsely-link": "https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2020/01/01/kevin-spacey-accusers-estate-drops-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://images.thestar.com/bXB2ydWgDpKE5lC_f9-DrkpsMKc=/93x66/smart/filters:cb(1577911551961)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/entertainment/2020/01/01/kevin-spacey-accusers-estate-drops-sexual-assault-lawsuit/spacey.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-01-01T15:35:47.969Z", "parsely-section": "Entertainment", "parsely-tags": "movies, Kevin spacey, sexual lawsuit, Spacey accuser, Spacey massage therapist, smg_entertainment, word count: 350-700 words, source: wire", "parsely-author": "Neil Vigdor", "parsely-metadata": "{\"storyuuid\": \"18b05720-2533-4a4a-a762-c4f0308b2bd6\"}"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2020/01/01/kevin-spacey-accusers-estate-drops-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html"}
