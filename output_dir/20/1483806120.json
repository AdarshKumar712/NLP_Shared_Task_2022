What does this year have in store for us?\n\nThe past year was not always a good one. We saw hate, internet bullies, rampant misinformation, long-time businesses closing up, and a growing division in the community. But, we also saw new financial investments in town, a start of better communication, celebrations of what is good, and an increased police force and fire department.\n\nWhat is waiting for us in 2020?\n\nLeadership - In 2020 there will be a new fire chief and city manager in South Lake Tahoe, and perhaps another top-level manager. In November's election, two City Council seats will be on the ballot. Over in Douglas County, two commissioners ended up in a fight in 2019 and meetings can be very contentious, especially when talking about Lake Tahoe...will that change in 2020?\n\nCell Tower Ordinance - In the coming weeks a new communications ordinance will be voted on, one that will provide a guide for all future cell and microcell towers. The public has had, and will continue to have, input on what it will say.\n\nVacation Home Rentals - The issues of vacation home rentals in the city limits was covered in the last election, with the result requiring their being phased out. But, a lawsuit may put a hamper on that.\n\nElections - Three members of the City Council still have two years left in their terms, but two are at the end of their four-year term as mentioned above. It is unknown at this time if they, Mayor Jason Collin and former Mayor Brooke Laine, will run again.\n\nNew Taxes - Voters in the Lake Valley Fire Protection District will vote on a new parcel tax to fund new equipment. Also coming, El Dorado County will be asking local voters to add more to their parcel taxes for snow removal.\n\nRecreation Center - The extra tourism taxes added onto hotel and vacation home rentals for a new recreation center have been sitting, waiting to be used for what the voters approved. That fund continues to grow. Hopefully, plans will be finalized this year.\n\nElectric Buses - Tahoe Transportation District is having two new electric buses built for South Lake Tahoe. They will be docked at Lake Tahoe Community College's new bus charging stations. Will the school district follow their guide and order more of their own since grant funds are now available for infrastructure?\n\nCourts - In the El Dorado County Superior Court, Councilman Cody Bass is scheduled for a jury trial on federal tax charges. Defendants accused of the murder of a pot dealer in South Lake Tahoe in 2016 are still in jail - will they ever be tried?\n\nAffordable Housing - Discussion has been going on for a long time, but is 2020 the year we see ground break on new project(s)?\n\nMarijuana - New marijuana businesses should be opening in 2020, starting first with an approved microbusiness at the Y and another on James Street. Retail sales only businesses were stopped by court action in November.\n\nThere will be many more issues in town in 2020, some already known and some not. Hopefully, the public and leadership can discuss them in a thoughtful, constructive manner without the hateful conversations that took place last year. Nothing good can come out of division.\n\nLet's have 2020 be the year of kindness, compassion, and progress. One where neighbors can be neighbors and unity is put back into community.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\n#BeKindSLT", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Lake Tahoe", "South Lake Tahoe", "Stateline", "Meyers", "Zephyr Cove", "Emerald Bay", "Camp Richardson", "Cave Rock", "Round Hill", "Heavenly", "2016", "2019", "action", "affordable", "affordable housing", "ballot", "brooke laine", "bus", "buses", "businesses", "cell tower", "change", "chief", "city", "city council", "city manager", "commissioners", "community", "council", "county", "court", "courts", "department", "discussion", "douglas county", "el dorado", "el dorado  county", "el dorado county", "election", "elections", "electric", "federal", "fire", "fire chief", "fire department", "fire protection", "future", "good", "grow", "home", "home rentals", "horizon", "hotel", "Housing", "infrastructure", "internet", "jail", "Jason Collin", "jury", "lake", "lake tahoe community", "Lake Tahoe south lake tahoe", "lake valley", "lake valley fire", "lawsuit", "Leadership", "local", "marijuana", "mayor", "meetings", "murder", "neighbors", "new year", "Nothing", "ordinance", "police", "pot", "progress", "protection", "recreation", "recreation center", "rentals", "retail", "run", "school", "school district", "snow", "snow removal", "store", "superior court", "Tahoe", "Tahoe Community", "tahoe south", "tahoe transportation", "tahoe transportation district", "tax", "taxes", "the y", "tourism", "town", "transportation", "transportation district", "vacation", "vacation home", "vacation home rentals", "valley fire", "vote", "voters", "y"], "tags": ["tourism", "meetings", "school", "protection", "horizon", "tahoe transportation district", "buses", "hotel", "run", "recreation center", "fire department", "Leadership", "y", "2016", "affordable housing", "store", "home rentals", "good", "internet", "police", "courts", "progress", "Opinion", "voters", "rentals", "Jason Collin", "bus", "future", "county", "douglas county", "the y", "2019", "snow", "lake", "infrastructure", "council", "lake tahoe community", "school district", "vacation home", "recreation", "change", "town", "superior court", "marijuana", "jury", "el dorado county", "fire chief", "jail", "city council", "court", "city", "businesses", "fire", "snow removal", "retail", "Housing", "ordinance", "lawsuit", "discussion", "murder", "affordable", "neighbors", "Tahoe Community", "vote", "election", "chief", "brooke laine", "city manager", "commissioners", "elections", "taxes", "fire protection", "electric", "ballot", "Tahoe", "grow", "local", "action", "valley fire", "tax", "lake valley fire", "home", "cell tower", "pot", "Nothing", "vacation home rentals", "mayor", "lake valley", "transportation district", "tahoe transportation", "community", "new year", "tahoe south", "department", "south lake tahoe", "federal", "Lake Tahoe", "Lake Tahoe south lake tahoe", "el dorado", "transportation", "vacation"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. - A we say goodbye to 2019, 2020 is on the horizon with hopes, dreams and a list of wishes for the new year.
