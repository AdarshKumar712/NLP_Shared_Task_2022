However, resolutions on their own aren\u2019t enough. Studies have shown that approximately 80% of people don\u2019t actually stick to their resolutions past the month of February, so how do the select 20% manage to do it?\n\nSimply put - they turn their resolutions into goals. A resolution on its own is like an empty promise. The intention is good, but the action isn\u2019t there. Imagine that a resolution is an umbrella and a goal is the handle. Like the handle, a goal quite literally holds up the resolution. To successfully achieve your New Years resolutions, whether they\u2019re personal or professional, you need both intention and action. This year, don\u2019t just set resolutions - set goals.\n\nThat\u2019s where goals come into play. Instead of a broad resolution of \u2018this year I want to get promoted\u2019, setting a goal forces you to get specific and choose a timeframe. \u2018I want to be promoted to manager by August\u2019 gives you an end date and therefore something to work consistently towards. While there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with saying \u2018by this time next year, I want...\u2019, the more specific you can be, the more likely you\u2019ll be to turn your resolution into reality.\n\nMost resolutions will actually need to be broken down into multiple goals, or one large goal with micro-goals to achieve along the way. Don\u2019t be afraid to really drill down on your goals and set milestones that you can achieve as you work towards the big goal of achieving your resolution.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve set your goals, go one step further and define your \u2018why\u2019. Your \u2018why\u2019 is crucial for maintaining motivation, and it\u2019s something you should refer back to quite often. It can help you push through challenges and keep going as the year progresses. To establish your \u2018why\u2019, think about how you\u2019ll feel when you accomplish your goal and how achieving it will improve your life. For example:\n\nResolution = Get promoted\n\nGoals = become a manger by August with a good salary increase, take charge of and lead at least one project in Jan/Feb, start discussions about promotion in February\n\nWhy = one more step in the right direction on a career path, better schedule, more money\n\nThis trifecta of resolution, goal, and motivation is the trick to not only making resolutions, but achieving them. With all of the thought and effort you\u2019ve put into your resolutions, you now have an action plan and a roadmap to follow that will put you well on your way to success.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ashira Prossack"], "publish_date": "Wed Dec 30 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "With a new decade just around the corner, you might find yourself even more inclined than usual to set a New Year's resolution.
