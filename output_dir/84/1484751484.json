Below is an excerpt from the article.\n\nIn England, the Thames Valley Police Department has announced it will stop posting photos of knives that officers have seized because the pictures may frighten people.\n\nThe South Australian Police says it is investigating an off-duty officer caught on video chasing and throwing rocks at the head of a wombat. In a statement, the police force said the wombat was \"seriously injured,\" but several media sources say the animal died.\n\nMichigan state Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo (D\u20138th District) wants to know who tore down a house she owns in Detroit without her permission or even notification. \"It's a hole in the ground,\" she told the Detroit Free Press. City officials say they didn't tear the house down and didn't issue a permit to any private party to do so. The house next door was torn down months ago by the Adamo Group, one of the largest contractors in the city's demolition program. Adamo has also torn down 3,396 other houses, for a total of $56 million in fees. The company says it did not tear down Gay-Dagnogo's house, but city officials say the matter is under investigation. The Adamo Group has torn down the wrong house at least once before.\n\nA French court has ruled that a man who died from a heart attack after an adulterous encounter suffered a work-related accident because he was on a business trip at the time. That decision will allow the man's widow to collect benefits. The company had challenged a ruling by the state health insurance provider that it was liable because the decision could cause the company's premiums to go up. The court said that French law protects a worker during the entire time of a business trip, even if he is not directly engaged in work activities at the time of an injury.\n\nFor years, children at the Little Ones Learning Center in Forest Park, Georgia, have grown vegetables. Last year, the preschool set up a bimonthly farm stand, selling produce grown by the students as well as from nearby farms. But this year, city officials shut it down because the school is in a residential neighborhood not zoned for food stands.\n\nRead more...", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Brickbats: January 2020"], "tags": ["QANON", "CHINA", "CLIMATE CHANGE", "RUSSIA", "SPYGATE", "IMPEACHMENT", "BREAKING", "NORTH KOREA", "TRUMP", "IRAN"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "In England, the Thames Valley Police Department has announced it will stop posting photos of knives that officers have seized", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Brickbats: January 2020", "description": "In England, the Thames Valley Police Department has announced it will stop posting photos of knives that officers have seized", "google-site-verification": "tFwban02zfqaKeK05Mkgz89TdOounWhx71cOQcw8qKY", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "noodp", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Brickbats: January 2020", "description": "In England, the Thames Valley Police Department has announced it will stop posting photos of knives that officers have seized", "url": "https://www.thenewscommenter.com/news/Brickbats-January-2020/1252596", "type": "website", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thenewscommenter.com/images/uploads/upload157789926666617_thumb.jpg", "width": 450, "height": 298}, "site_name": "The News Commenter"}, "fb": {"app_id": 286353854823765}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newscommenter", "creator": "@newscommenter", "title": "Brickbats: January 2020", "description": "In England, the Thames Valley Police Department has announced it will stop posting photos of knives that officers have seized", "image": "https://www.thenewscommenter.com/images/uploads/upload157789926666617_thumb.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thenewscommenter.com/news/Brickbats-January-2020/1252596"}
