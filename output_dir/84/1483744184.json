Driving under the influence was not suspected in the crash, he said, chalking up the collision to an \u201cunsafe turning movement that caused the vehicle to leave the roadway.\u201d\n\nThe teenager was transported to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital for treatment, Wandel said.\n\nThe house, which appeared to be home to several people, lost electric service as the impact splintered a power pole and pulled off an electrical panel, he said. None of the home\u2019s occupants were injured as a result of the crash, according to CHP.\n\nYou can reach Staff Writer Will Schmitt at 707-521-5207 or will.schmitt@pressdemocrat.com.
