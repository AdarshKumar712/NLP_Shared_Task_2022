Being the youngest prime minister as he was in 2004, he is now the first prime minister to win four consecutive general elections in that Caribbean country. Skerrit was also able to lead his ruling Dominica Labor Party (DLP) into a fifth consecutive general election victory despite moves by the Opposition parties \u2013 both legal and otherwise \u2013 to halt the December 6 General Election.\n\n\u201cI have never seen so much external interest in our campaign,\u201d Skerrit said after the DLP swept the main Opposition United Workers Party (UWP) by an 18-3 margin in the two-way fight for control of the 21-member Parliament.\n\nThe Opposition had, during the campaign, called for electoral reform, and more so, the need for voter identification cards with pictures and a cleansing of the electoral list.\n\nThe Opposition was supported in its call by the United States and secretary-general of the Organization of American States (OAS), Luis Almagro, who earlier in the year had been the subject of much criticism from a divided Caribbean Community (Caricom) grouping on his unilateral backing for the efforts to remove the elected Government in Venezuela.\n\nAs he was being sworn into office, less than 24 hours after the victory, Skerrit said he believed the \u201cexternal people\u201d had used the Opposition Leader Lennox Linton, whom he said had been used \u201cto carry out their plans\u201d, instead of focusing on the campaign.\n\n\u201cI do not envy him. I never had the opportunity of being in Opposition, people have told me it is not nice,\u201d Skerrit said. Linton had made it clear he would not recognize the election results, even though several regional and international observer teams, including those from the OAS, the Commonwealth, and CARICOM, said reflected the will of the people in Dominica. Linton has since said the party intends to challenge the matter in the courts.\n\nGuyana\n\nMeanwhile in Guyana, Granger\u2019s coalition Government \u2013 A Partnership for National Unity (APNU) \u2013 was able to remain in office even though it had been defeated in an Opposition-inspired motion of no confidence in December 2018 and the voters were expected to cast ballots for a new Government 90 days later in keeping with the provisions of the Constitution.\n\nIn July, the Trinidad-based Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ), which is Guyana\u2019s highest court, ruled that the vote of no confidence against Granger\u2019s coalition Administration was valid and urged all parties to adhere to the provisions of the country\u2019s constitution. But it gave no date for holding the elections.\n\nUnder the Guyana Constitution, the elections should have taken place 90 days after the vote of no confidence had been passed.\n\nThe constitution also makes provision for an extension of the period based only on a two-thirds majority vote in the Parliament. The National Assembly did not provide that extension.\n\nThe ruling by the CCJ followed legal moves by the Government to challenge the legality of the vote of no confidence in the lower courts after one Government legislator had sided with the Opposition to pass the motion and overturn the Government\u2019s slender one-seat majority in the 65-member National Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe challenged the validity of the no\u00ad confidence motion and defended the challenge to the constitutionality of the appointment of the chairman of the Elections Commission,\u201d Granger said, adding that the legal processes were neither frivolous nor aimed at delaying the consequences of the no-confidence motion. The CCJ had also ruled that the appointment of retired Justice James Patterson as Chairman of the Guyana Elections Commission (GECOM) was flawed and urged a consensual appointment supported by both the president and the leader of the Opposition Bharrat Jagdeo.\n\nIn the end, the parties agreed on retired Justice Claudette Singh, who would inform the country that the polls could be held in February next year.\n\nBut Granger had insisted that the polls would only be held when GECOM said it is prepared to conduct a free and fair poll and while the main opposition People\u2019s Progressive Party (PPP) had rallied against plans for a new voters list generated by a house-to-house registration exercise, including a legal challenge, it agreed with Granger\u2019s announcement that voters would elect a new Government on March 2 next year.\n\nVirgin Islands\n\nEight years after it was swept out of power, the Virgin Islands Party (VIP), headed by Andrew A Fahie, in March won the general election in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), winning eight of the 13 seats at stake.\n\nThe party, which formed the Government between 2007 and 2011, won four district seats and four Territorial at-large seats, while the incumbent National Democratic Party (NDP) won three seats. Fahie, 48, was ousted as Opposition Leader last December, following the split within the then-ruling NDP, with Ronnie Skelton leading a faction, and became the largest opposition party in Parliament.\n\nThe election was the first general election in the territory to use electronically-tabulated voting, rather than manual counts.\n\nMontserrat\n\nIn Montserrat, another British Overseas Territory, Easton Taylor-Farrell, led his Movement for Change and Prosperity (MCAP) into power in November, reversing its 2014 electoral defeat.\n\n\u201cIt is a bittersweet celebration, now that we have come home; in the MCAP camp, we are celebrating. I must admit I would have preferred to have a bit larger majority, that\u2019s not the case, but we will work with what we have for the benefit of this country,\u201d he said.\n\nTaylor-Farrell, who took over the leadership of the party after then-Premier Reuben Meade lost the 2014 General Election to the People\u2019s Democratic Movement said the time has now come to heal the nation, and he would also be placing much emphasis on the youth of the island.\n\nOutgoing Premier Donaldson Romeo, who had been ousted as leader of the ruling People\u2019s Democratic Movement (PDM) weeks before the election, was the only successful independent candidate in the election.\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines\n\nIn June, St. Vincent and the Grenadines emerged victorious winning a seat and becoming the smallest country to become a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for a two-year term. Prime Minister Dr. Ralph Gonsalves described it as a \u201csweet, very sweet, sweet victory.\n\n\u201cI am saying thanks first of all to Almighty God, we thank the members of the United Nations, we thank the members of the Group of Latin America and the Caribbean, those from the Africa group, Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, and others and Eastern Europe \u2013 all of the countries of the world,\u201d Gonsalves said. After a decade-long campaign, St Vincent and the Grenadines, the Group for Latin America and the Caribbean (GRULAC)-endorsed candidate for the term 2020-2021, secured 185 of the possible 191 votes, while six went to El Salvador, which announced a last-minute bid.\n\nSt Vincent and the Grenadines became only the second Caribbean Community country to serve on the Security Council since Jamaica\u2019s 2000-2001 term.\n\nUnrest in Haiti\n\nWhile Skerrit, Granger, Fahie and Taylor\u00ad Farrell and even Kingstown could have regarded 2019 as a \u201cvery good year\u201d or them, this was certainly not the case for President Jovenel Moise in Haiti, who came to power in 2017 and Suriname\u2019s President Desi Bouterse, the leaders of the only two nonspeaking English countries within Caricom.\n\nPresident Moise spent all of 2019 deflecting calls for his resignation by opposition parties that staged violent and fatal demonstrations across the French-speaking Caricom country. The opposition parties accused Moise of corruption and unsuccessfully sought to impeach him on the grounds of high treason, violating the Haitian Constitution and leading the country to \u201cthe edge of social explosion.\u201d\n\nThe unfolding social and political situation in Haiti was of concern to the wider Caricom grouping that had, following their summit in St Lucia in July, named its chairman and host\n\nPrime Minister Allen Chastanet, as well as his counterparts from Jamaica and The Bahamas to undertake a fact-finding mission to be facilitated by the Haitian Government.\n\nAt year-end, the mission was still grounded and Caricom said it was still awaiting a response from Port au Prince for the good office\u2019s prime ministerial delegation to visit. Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s ambassador to the OAS Sir Ronald Sanders would later urge Caricom not to abandon Haiti.\n\n\u201cHaiti is in turmoil again. This time the countries of the Caribbean Community cannot be criticized for inaction, but questions must be asked about others in the hemispheric community who have been silent about the political and humanitarian situation in the country, \u201cSir Ronald said, in a clear reference to the OAS, \u201cwhich has been active in other countries [but] has been conspicuously silent\u201d on Haiti.\n\nBy year-end, Antigua and Barbuda and St Vincent and the Grenadines nominated Ecuadorian diplomat Maria Fernanda Espinosa to replace the incumbent OAS Secretary-General, with St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Dr. Ralph Gonsalves \u201curging all Caribbean leaders not to vote for Almargo\u201d when the election comes up in March next year.\n\nPresident Bouterse\n\nIn November, a Military Court sentenced President Bouterse to 20 years in prison for his involvement in the 1982 murders of 15 political opponents of his then military Government in the Dutch-speaking CARICOM country. The trial had been going on for several years and in a lengthy verdict, the court did not order his detention.\n\nIn 2017, Bouterse along with 23 co-defendants appeared in the Military Court after the Court of Justice had earlier rejected a motion to stop the trial. The former military officers and civilians had been charged with the December 8, 1982 murders of 15 men that included journalists, military officers, union leaders, lawyers, businessmen, and university lecturers. The prosecution had alleged that the men were arrested on the night of December 7 and 8 of that year and transferred to Fort Zeelandia, then the headquarters of the Surinamese National Army. They said the men were tortured that night and summarily executed.\n\nBouterse, who has since filed an appeal and was out of the country when the verdict was given, said the decision of the three-panel Military Court was not unexpected.\n\n\u201cIt was clear that the verdict was political,\u201d he said, indicating that he was also advised by his lawyers not to discuss the ruling and was now concentrating on the general election constitutionally due by mid-2020.\n\nBouterse is not the only Caribbean leader with elections on his mind next year. Trinidad and Tobago, St Kitts-Nevis, Anguilla, and possibly, St Vincent and the Grenadines should all be holding general elections in 2020.\n\nIn 2019, some opposition parties failed in their quest to remove incumbent administrations through motions of no confidence.\n\nSt Lucia\u2019s Opposition Leader Phillip J Pierre had urged legislators to vote their conscience and remove Prime Minister Chastanet from office, but in the end, the ruling United Workers Party (UWP) used its comfortable majority to defeat the motion.\n\nIt was a similar case in The Bahamas, where the Government in December used its majority in the Parliament to successfully amend a motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Dr. Hubert Minnis that had been tabled by Opposition Leader Phillip \u201cBrave\u201d Davis.\n\nDavis had earlier told legislators that he took no pleasure in moving the motion \u201cbut what is at stake is bigger than me or any individual in this place.\n\n\u201cWhat is at stake is our democratic system of government and the tenets, the laws, the conventions, processes, procedures, and practices that undergird them.\u201d\n\nIn St. Kitts-Nevis it was the Opposition that refused to vote in support of a Government move to limit the term of a prime minister to two terms.\n\nPrime Minister Dr. Timothy Harris, had piloted the Constitution of St Christopher and Nevis (Tenure of Office of Prime Minister) (Amendment) Bill, 2019) and it needed the support of the Opposition in order to get the required special majority needed to amend the Constitution.\n\nPeter Phillips\n\nIn Jamaica, Opposition Leader Dr. Peter Phillip survived a strong challenge to his leadership when he defeated Peter Bunting in a challenge for control of the People\u2019s National Party (PNP).\n\nAt the same time, Caricom, which became divided on the removal of the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, continued 2019 even though the regional leaders at their summit in July issued a statement reaffirming their non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.nycaribnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cropped-2.-caribnews-logo-circle-only-32x32.jpg", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"type": "activity", "title": "2019 Was a Mixed Year for the Caribbean | New York Carib News", "description": "BRIDGETOWN,\u00a0Barbados\u00a0(CMC)\u00a0-\u00a0When the American,\u00a0Ervin\u00a0Drake,\u00a0wrote\u00a0the lyrics for his\u00a0song,\u00a0'It\u00a0Was\u00a0A\u00a0Very\u00a0Good\u00a0Year',\u00a0in 1961,\u00a0Dominica's Prime Minister Roosevelt\u00a0Skerrit was\u00a0not\u00a0born", "url": "https://www.nycaribnews.com/articles/2019-was-a-mixed-year-for-the-caribbean/", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nycaribnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/antilles.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.nycaribnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/antilles.jpg"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "2019 Was a Mixed Year for the Caribbean | New York Carib News", "description": "BRIDGETOWN,\u00a0Barbados\u00a0(CMC)\u00a0-\u00a0When the American,\u00a0Ervin\u00a0Drake,\u00a0wrote\u00a0the lyrics for his\u00a0song,\u00a0'It\u00a0Was\u00a0A\u00a0Very\u00a0Good\u00a0Year',\u00a0in 1961,\u00a0Dominica's Prime Minister Roosevelt\u00a0Skerrit was\u00a0not\u00a0born", "image": "https://www.nycaribnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/antilles.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.nycaribnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cropped-2.-caribnews-logo-circle-only-270x270.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.nycaribnews.com/articles/2019-was-a-mixed-year-for-the-caribbean/"}
