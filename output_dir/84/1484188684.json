January presents a fresh start. A new beginning.\n\nPlenty of bad news has been reported in the outgoing year and decade. Many commentators this season seem compelled to offer a counterbalance, gently reminding readers that much progress is underway.\n\nOne could, in fact, make a convincing argument that these are the best times in human history. Worldwide, poverty is receding, and education and literacy are on the rise. Never in history have so many people been so well off materially. One world index shows prosperity increasing in 148 countries and falling in only 19 during the past decade. Over the past three decades, more than a billion people worldwide have moved out of extreme poverty, according to the World Bank.\n\nWhile oppressive regimes continue on in many places, in Hong Kong and elsewhere citizens are rising up to demand a voice in their own government through democratic means.\n\nBut what of these numerous wrongs and injustices? Does noting progress mean we need to do nothing and find that wrongs somehow self-correct?\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. didn\u2019t think so. \u201cHuman progress is neither automatic nor inevitable,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle; the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals.\u201d He didn\u2019t hold much with complaints of compassion fatigue, either.\n\nAnother vital piece of good news is that people around the world are responding to human needs. An estimated 1 billion volunteers do something to help others every day, according to United Nations officials involved in volunteer efforts. In the United States, 63 million people, about 25% of all adult Americans, contribute volunteer work worth an average of more than $25 per hour of service.\n\nGood actions provide a powerful counterbalance to news that would disturb, discourage, or enervate. \u201cHow wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world,\u201d wrote young Anne Frank as the Holocaust began to rise around her.\n\nThe founder of The Christian Science Monitor, Mary Baker Eddy, saw that individual action was essential for progress.\n\n\u201cBut what of ourselves, and our times and obligations?\u201d she said in remarks given at a Fourth of July service honoring America\u2019s heroes. \u201cAre we duly aware of our own great opportunities and responsibilities? Are we prepared to meet and improve them, to act up to the acme of divine energy wherewith we are armored?\u201d\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
