Being the final game of 2019, Wekundu wa Msimbazi were keen on avoiding surprises and bag maximum points.\n\nFormer winger Francis Kahata took only 13 minutes to open the scoring for the 20-time league champions. The hosts won a free-kick about 20-yards from the Ndanda goal; then the Kenyan international curled the ball past the wall and into the back of the net to score his second goal in as many games for his club.\n\nNeither of the two teams could get another goal in the first half despite the numerous chances created especially by the league leaders. Ibrahim Ajib and the returning John Bocco were responsible for missing glorious opportunities for their teams.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nSubstitute Deo Kanda, who had come on for Francis Kahata, handed the hosts the final blow in the 86th minute when he deflected in a Gadiel Michael shot past goalkeeper Ally Mustapha.\n\nThe result took Simba's points tally to 34, 10 more than second-placed Yanga SC. The two teams will play each other on Saturday in the Kariakoo Derby.\n\nElsewhere, Mwadui FC settled to a 1-1 draw against KMC at Mwadui Complex; the visitors opened the scoring in the 15th minute courtesy of Abdul Hilal before Enock Mkanga equalized in the 70th minute.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Ligi kuu Bara", "Simba v Ndanda", "Simba", "Ndanda"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 07:45:44 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Simba SC defeat Ndanda 2-0 in Tanzania Mainland League to open a 10-point gap.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "description": "Simba SC defeat Ndanda 2-0 in Tanzania Mainland League to open a 10-point gap.", "keywords": "Ligi kuu Bara,Simba v Ndanda,Simba,Ndanda", "robots": "max-snippet:1000, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:1000, INDEX, FOLLOW", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@goal"}, "og": {"title": "Kahata on target as Simba SC open a 10-point gap with win against Ndanda | Goal.com", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.goal.com/en/news/kahata-on-target-as-simba-sc-open-a-10-point-gap-with-win-vs/fsmugxiqf4741q5qp53l9pi1v", "description": "Simba SC defeat Ndanda 2-0 in Tanzania Mainland League to open a 10-point gap.", "image": "https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/GOAL/98/44/francis-kahata-of-simba-sc-vs-ndanda-fc_1951jkie6jglr166p6dfduttbz.jpg?t=1618488671&quality=100&h=300"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#081f2c", "theme-color": "#081f2c", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.kokteyl.goal"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.goal.com/en/news/kahata-on-target-as-simba-sc-open-a-10-point-gap-with-win-vs/fsmugxiqf4741q5qp53l9pi1v"}
