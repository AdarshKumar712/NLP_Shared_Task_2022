That number is up on last year, but according to MidCoast Council's economic development co-ordinator Robyn Brennan, it is in keeping with previous years and numbers are usually between 3000 and 5000. \"We're pretty happy, considering how hot it was and it was quite windy. We think the wind would have kept the temperature down on the riverbank.\" Robyn said it was a difficult decision for council to continue with the fireworks, especially as many people in the community were calling for them to be cancelled in respect of the bushfires ravaging Australia and the volunteer firefighters out fighting them. \"It's not as easy as cancelling the fireworks and doing a donation. We'd committed to a lot of those expenses 12 months out.\" She said the community event is an opportunity for people to come together on a good night. \"We are respectful to those impacted by the bushfires, and whether or not we went ahead the reality is everything was already locked in and we were already committed to covering those expenses.\" She said the pyrotechnicians had already ordered the stock and had staff employed to run the displays. \"We would have had to pay for it even if we didn't go ahead. \"We know that without the fireworks the attendance numbers would have dropped off. \"You're never going to please everyone. It's a big family night out and the kids love it, which is what it's all about.\" Holding the celebrations without the fireworks would have meant a drop in the economic benefit to the Manning community. About 20 vendors are involved in the event. In addition, council uses local companies like Coates Hire and Kennards for the toilets, local performers and a local security company. \"It's to get people out of their homes and holiday accommodation and out on the town, and help stimulate spending in the town,\" Robyn said. \"It's people preparing for the night and going out and buying glowsticks, and what we've found, people book at those waterfront venues in Taree or Tuncurry and then are hanging around for the fireworks. \"It's a family friendly event, it's alcohol free so you can bring the kids out and know you're in a safe environment. \"We work quite closely with the police, ambulance and RFS to make sure we are aware of what's happening and the conditions. It's a combined effort.\" The New Year's Eve celebrations started around 5pm with food and entertainment. \"It was a little slow to start because of the heat and it was about 8-8.30 that we hit our peak numbers.\" Planning is a 12 month process. \"We will go back after the holiday season is over and start contacting the existing vendors and their attendance for the next one, which will be confirmed by May,\" Robyn said. \"We have two-year contracts in place with the pyrotechnicians, so it's locked in 12 to 24 months out. \"As is with planning for events of this size, as soon as one is finished we're planning the next event, it's pretty normal. We lock all the sponsors in to ensure they are included in all promotional material and signage. \"Because the fireworks are launched over the river, we also need to secure approval from the RMS.\" Following the event, Robyn said they like to do a full debrief with RMS, police, ambulance, the security company and operation managers to talk about how it went, any opportunities to improve and feedback from the people on the night.
