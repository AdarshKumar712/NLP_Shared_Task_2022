Imagine having to get all of your groceries from a gas station or local corner store bodega where you're forced to select bags of chips and frozen pizza as sustenance. This is the reality for the millions of citizens who live in food deserts in the United States. The United States lacks equal access to food across communities and food availability is scarce in portions of the country known as food deserts.\n\nIn 2014, the United States Department of Agriculture performed a food access study and defined a US food desert as an area where 33 percent of a city\u2019s residents live more than one mile from a supermarket and 20 percent earn below the poverty line. Many residents of food desert locations do not have cars and lack access to public transportation, making them essentially unable to get to a grocery store. Food desert causes are mostly related to economics. Big chain supermarkets have a hard time turning a profit in impoverished areas, which results in places without food cropping up across the country. The effects are devastating. The obesity rates in these areas are generally higher, meaning life-threatening illnesses like diabetes and heart disease are on the rise. Luckily, new laws and various grassroots organizations are currently working to make healthy, affordable food available nationwide. On a local level, many cities have not just opened up food co-ops and food markets in impoverished areas. Local corner stores are also expanding their inventory. Instead of using all of their shelf space for junk food, they are providing more healthy fresh food options.\n\nTo learn more about the issue and what's being done, scan this list of the top food deserts in the United States.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["cartoons", "snacks", "Weird History", "Graveyard Shift", "funny", "baseball", "college sports", "Weirdly Interesting", "Food", "combat sports", "culture", "Unspeakable Times", "nerdy", "singers", "history", "entertainment", "Total Nerd", "gaming", "war", "cooking", "world history", "music history", "secret menu items", "rock", "libations", "restaurants", "Cities", "ancient history", "astrology", "country", "athletes", "us history", "horror", "Weird Nature", "travel", "Anime Underground", "politics", "career", "pop music", "historical figures", "social media", "behind the scenes", "deep thoughts", "Us Cities", "nfl", "space", "beauty", "toys", "celebrity", "fast food", "nba", "anime", "healthy eating", "fashion", "hockey", "watchworthy", "soccer", "living", "pets", "metal", "mysteries", "relationships", "LGBTQ", "hip hop", "royalty", "family", "comedy", "Button Mash", "nostalgia", "home"], "authors": ["Ann Casano"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "What is a food desert?
