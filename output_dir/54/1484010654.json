Almost as beautiful as Tiegs, her Balinese-style Bel Air home is for sale at $18.5 million.\n\nHer enclave is situated on 1.43 lush acres behind gates that open to a long drive, giving privacy and entrance into something that feels much more like the deep tropics than suburban Los Angeles. Perched on a promontory with 180-degree views, it is awash in palm trees, huge Monstera vines, and tropical flowers. The house itself is a study in bold natural elements, textures, and colors from fabrics, floors, dark-wood beams, glass walls opening to vegetation, and stunning views. The 4,770-square-foot house has five bedrooms, five baths, a kitchen with a butcher-block island, huge open spaces for entertaining both inside and out, a wine cellar, pool, guest house, and three-car garage.\n\nTiegs began modeling when she was 17, appearing on the covers of Glamour, Seventeen and Elle. Her fresh-faced beauty inspired teenaged girls and young women to buy her beauty book, The Way to Natural Beauty, in the hope that they would discover some wonderful secret that would turn them into glamour girls, too. Ahead of her time and a natural entrepreneur, Cheryl was noted for being first at many things: She was the first model to start a signature line of clothing and accessories, which were sold exclusively at Sears. During the 10-year life of that business, almost a billion dollars of her merchandise was sold.\n\nWith her modeling career taking her all over the world, Tiegs was able to pick from her own experiences how she wanted to live. When it came time to buy her own home, she found solace and inspiration in the Balinese way of life and duplicated that environment in her own Southern California home.\n\nJade Mills and Tiffany Mills of Coldwell Banker Global Luxury, Beverly Hills are the listing agents.\n\n6.

For more than a decade, the superwealthy have been parking it in real estate. In fact, they\u2019re buying up a lot of the planet in the form of islands, vast ranches, resorts, and glamorous homes. Yes, Oprah owns at least six homes despite selling her Chicago and Atlanta properties. Lately, her focus has been on the Montecito neighborhood of Santa Barbara, where she purchased actor-friend Jeff Bridges\u2019s home. She owns three in Montecito, including \u201cThe Promised Land\u201d (her 40-acre main home and grounds), now worth about $90 million. She purchased Bridges\u2019s home after waiting for the price to be reduced from the original $7.495 million. She bought it for $6.85 million \u2014 the exact price Bridges and his wife, Susan Geston, paid for it five years ago. Oprah also owns homes in Maui, Hawaii, Orcas Island, Washington, and Telluride, Colorado.\n\nBridges\u2019s 3,517-square-foot, two-bedroom, three-bath Spanish Revival-style home was built in 1919 by architect James Osborn Craig on four acres of gardens.

The master suite features an open-beamed ceiling, large bay window, French doors, and a fireplace.\n\nMontecito is a sought-after neighborhood at the western tip of Santa Barbara with commanding views of the Pacific Ocean. Always lush with large trees and thick with greenery, the neighborhood has recovered from the 2018 Thomas Fire that destroyed several homes.

He announced his retirement from acting in 1999 to return to music, his first love, but fans are thrilled to learn that once again he has teamed up with Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, and Al Pacino for The Irishman, which is streaming on Netflix. In the meantime, Pesci has put his waterfront home up for sale in Lavallette, New Jersey, with his sights focused on returning to the warm California sunshine.

The large eat-in kitchen with island is perfect for preparing meals for dinner guests in the dining room, which is encircled by glass doors opening to the pool terrace.\n\nThe media room walls are decorated with posters from Pesci\u2019s films, and a barber\u2019s chair occupies one corner, a poignant reminder of his first occupation. The upper level, which can be reached by elevator, contains bedrooms and an office, all with terraces and spectacular views. A downstairs party room next to the pool and spa has its own kitchen for entertaining.\n\nAfter making 34 films, Joe Pesci has cut his second album, Vincent LaGuardia Gambini Sings Just for You, named after his character in My Cousin Vinny.

Imagine crystal chandeliers twinkling against natural rock and reclaimed wood \u2014 all in perfect balance. To add even more intrigue, access is via a private funicular, a golf cart, or a hillside of stone steps \u2014 but no cars.\n\nBack on the market after a long hiatus, the home has been reduced to $9.5 million.\n\nThe co-listing agents are Scott Lyle of Douglas Elliman, Palm Springs and Ronald Parks of Pacific Sotheby\u2019s, Palm Springs.\n\n9. Adam Lambert\u2019s Hollywood Hills pad\n\nPrevious -- of -- Next Advertisement\n\nDelivering a blend of contemporary sound and theatrics, Adam Lambert\u2019s style has propelled him from an American Idol superstar singer-songwriter into an international celebrity.

Neighbors include Leonardo DiCaprio, who bought two extra lots and built a huge basketball court, Keanu Reeves, and Halle Berry.\n\nThough Lambert hit the big time when he appeared on American Idol in 2009, his career began in 2001 as a cruise ship entertainer.
