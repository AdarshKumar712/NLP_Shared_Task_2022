Two unexpected entrants were noted, one tow truck to pick up a Tournament of Roses Hall of Fame fire engine that overheated near Mar Vista Avenue, and another to mop up a small oily mess the engine left behind.\n\nMembers of the Pasadena Celebrates 2020 float during the 131st Rose Parade in Pasadena, CA., on Wednesday, Jan. 1, 2020.

(Photo by Keith Durflinger, Contributing Photographer)\n\nEarly predictions of rain and nasty wind never materialized. Instead, the parade welcomed the New Year on a postcard-perfect Pasadena day.\n\nThe verdict from the hundreds of thousands who lined the traditional route? \u201cBetter than last year,\u201d agreed Pasadena residents Raquel Garcia and Alfonso Zavala, perched in prime viewing spots on Colorado Boulevard.\n\nThe Pasadena pair particularly enjoyed this year\u2019s musical roster, which boasted more Latin-American bands than ever before. That wasn\u2019t strategic, said Laura Farber, the Tournament of Roses\u2019 first Latina president, with all the bands chosen solely on merit.\n\nAmong the brassy ensembles: Musicians from West Harrison High School, in Gulf Port, the first Mississippi band to perform in the parade in 30 years. Proud mom Mandy Geddings scurried about on the sidelines as the band trooped by, calling out to her daughter and snapping cell phone photos.\n\n\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d she said, gathering her breath. \u201cIt makes all those years and all that work of being a band parent all worth it.\u201d\n\nThe Pasadena City College Honor Band marched through with four students from Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, who performed among 70-some other top Southern California student musicians. The four students were selected prior to the Nov. 14 shooting at the school but said marching in the parade helped them cope with the trauma spurred by the shocking campus attack.\n\n\u201cIt was good to get back to being with people,\u201d Saugus junior Jason Treanor said. \u201cWe could be social and not be stuck at home, dwelling on what happened.\u201d\n\nThe band was bookended by the tournament\u2019s beaming Royal Court and a float that proved to be 100 years in the making.\n\nThe seven-member court sat on a tiered float with Rose Queen Camille Kennedy sitting up high with the six princesses on the levels below. Kennedy, a self-described history buff and thespian, reveled in her role, taking a particular interest in the court\u2019s volunteer work.\n\nFollowing the Pasadena City College Honor Band came a float from Pasadena Celebrates 2020, adorned in such quotes as \u201cEqual Rights for All\u201d and \u201cLifting as We Climb\u201d \u2014 all surrounding a mock Statue of Liberty and accompanied by a throng of suffragists. Titled \u201cYears of Hope. Years of Courage,\u201d the float celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.\n\nThe parade\u2019s top honor for floats, the 2020 Sweepstakes Trophy, went to the UPS Store entry, \u201cStories Change Our World,\u201d featuring whimsical monkeys and parrots set against a patch of of tropical trees.\n\nWhile that float, and most others, were crafted by professionals, the Downey Rose Float Association took home the top award among the floats built by volunteers. Featuring a floral garden, a small pagoda and a bridge running over a river of blue roses, the float\u2019s defining elements were large origami cranes.\n\nDowney volunteers spent weeks folding 10,000 small paper cranes ahead of the event. They were ultimately distributed to nonprofits, according to a news release from the float\u2019s sponsor, PIH Health.\n\nFor the first time, the parade featured a mid-parade \u201chalftime show\u201d with a live-action production number from Disney\u2019s \u201cFrozen.\u201d Portraying such characters as Anna, Elsa and Olaf, the performance featured players from the production currently on stage at the Hollywood Pantages, just a few months before the Los Angeles-based crew takes its show on the national road, a spokeswoman for the tournament said.\n\nThe elaborate performance was one of three major musical moments in the parade. Also included:\n\nThe Rose Parade Opening Spectacular, starring Ally Brooke, Emilio Estefan, Farruko, myriad dancers and the Chino Hills High School Drumline. They performed an original choreographed song, \u201cReach for the Stars.\u201d\n\nThe parade\u2019s closing show, \u201cWhere Flowers and Football Meet!\u201d featured a song from Los Lobos and American Idol alum Alejandro Aranda, also known as Scarypoolparty.\n\nLegendary 88-year-old actress Rita Moreno \u2014 one of three grand marshals, all Latinas chosen by Farber \u2014 proved a crowd favorite as she energetically danced her way down Colorado Boulevard in the back of a historic car. Some declared her a \u201ca national treasure.\u201d\n\nFans also sung the praises of her two co-marshals, actress Gina Torres and Olympic gold medalist Laurie Hernandez.\n\n\u201cWe thought we had a fantastic parade today,\u201d Tournament of Roses Chief Executive David Eads said. He lauded the floats and the musical performances, as well as the unbeatable weather.\n\nThere were no arrests during the parade itself, police said and only three people were cited for drunken behavior the night before. That\u2019s down from last year\u2019s seven citations.\n\n\u201cThere were no issues at all,\u201d Lt. Pete Hettema of the Pasadena Police Department said \u201cAs far as law enforcement, we had a good day.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Top Stories WDN", "Top Stories PE", "Top Stories Breeze", "Top Stories RDF", "Rose Parade", "Top Stories Sun", "Top Stories LADN", "Top Stories PSN", "Top Stories SGVT", "Top Stories LBPT", "Top Stories OCR"], "authors": ["Bradley Bermont", "Bradley Bermont Is A Reporter In Los Angeles.
