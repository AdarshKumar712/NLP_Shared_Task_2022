For instance, the Orionid meteor shower can be found in the sky when stargazers have a good view of the Orion constellation.\n\n[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]\n\nHow to Watch\n\nThe best way to see a meteor shower is to get to a location that has a clear view of the entire night sky. Ideally, that would be somewhere with dark skies, away from city lights and traffic. To maximize your chances of catching the show, look for a spot that offers a wide, unobstructed view.\n\nBits and pieces of meteor showers are visible for a certain period of time, but they really peak visibly from dusk to dawn on a given few days. Those days are when Earth\u2019s orbit crosses through the thickest part of the cosmic stream. Meteor showers can vary in their peak times, with some reaching their maximums for only a few hours and others for several nights. The showers tend to be most visible after midnight and before dawn.\n\nIt is best to use your naked eye to spot a meteor shower. Binoculars or telescopes tend to limit your field of view. You might need to spend about half an hour in the dark to let your eyes get used to the reduced light. Stargazers should be warned that moonlight and the weather can obscure the shows. But if that happens, there are usually meteor livestreams like the ones hosted by NASA and by Slooh.\n\nWhile the International Meteor Organization lists a variety of meteor showers that could be seen, below you\u2019ll find the showers that are most likely to be visible in the sky this year.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Nicholas St. Fleur"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "All year long, Earth passes through streams of cosmic debris.
