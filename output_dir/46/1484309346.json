Now, the Australian company has just unveiled another beautiful design, the Sadie, which is its first eco-retreat in Victoria. Tucked in the foothills of the Great Dividing Range, the solar-powered cabin is the ideal spot for reconnecting with nature in the new year.\n\nLike all of CABN\u2019s projects, the Sadie is designed to go completely off the grid while still offering the ultimate in comfort for guests who are looking to immerse themselves in nature. Located on a remote property in Daylesford, the cabin is less than a 1.5 hour drive from Melbourne. Guests staying at the tiny cabin will enjoy the secluded area, which is surrounded by lush forest and unspoiled nature.\n\nRelated: These Australian tiny cabins are designed to help us disconnect\n\nWith a master bedroom and a comfy day bed, the cabin can accommodate up to four guests. In addition to the two sleep spaces, there is a main living area complete with the company\u2019s signature, massive window that frames views of the forested landscape. This window is accompanied by a handful more, all of which brighten the space with natural light during the day.\n\nDespite its small size, the cabin has more than enough amenities to make guests feel at home. The bathroom sports a simplistic design of unfinished wood and has enough space for a shower and a composting toilet. For meals, there is a fully equipped kitchen and an outdoor grill. Guests can also enjoy a nice glass of wine while lounging around the firepit, provided its not bushfire season, of course.\n\nAlthough the cabin, which starts at $200 per night, is located in a remote forest seemingly at the end of the earth, in reality, the cabin retreat is in Daylesford, which has plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. Additionally, there are plenty of local wineries in the area to tour.\n\n+ CABN\n\nImages via CABN", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["off-grid tiny cabin", "off-grid cabin", "tiny cabin", "off-grid", "digital detox", "cabn", "", "eco friendly cabins", "off grid cabins", "off grid retreats", "solar-powered cabins", "tiny cabins"], "tags": ["off-grid cabins", "cabin retreat", "tiny cabin", "composting toilet", "solar-powered"], "authors": ["Nicole Jewell"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "CABN has unveiled the Sadie.
