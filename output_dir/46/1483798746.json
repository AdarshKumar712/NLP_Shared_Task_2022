So at first sight [Glen Akins]\u2019 LED decorated Christmas tree looks pretty enough, but isn\u2019t particularly unusual. But after reading his write-up you\u2019ll discover there\u2019s far more to the project than meets the eye, and learn a lot about the technologies behind it that has relevance far beyond a festive light show.\n\nThe decoration is powered exclusively from power-over-Ethernet, with a PIC microcontroller translating Art-Net DMX-over-Ethernet packets into commands for the LED string. The control board is designed from the ground up and includes all the PoE circuitry, and the write-up gives a very thorough introduction to this power source that takes the reader way beyond regarding PoE as simply another off-the-shelf black box. Along the way we see all his code, as well as learn a few interesting tidbits such as the use of a pre-programmed EEPROM containing a unique MAC address.\n\nSo if your house has CAT5 wiring and you want an extra dimension to your festive splendour, you\u2019ve officially got a whole year to build your own version.
