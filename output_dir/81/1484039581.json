With it, comes new innovations in every major field, from technology to medicine \u2014 and cosmetic procedures are no exception.\n\nWith that, Life & Style spoke exclusively with board-certified plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe to get his professional opinion on what the biggest plastic surgery trends for 2020 will be. Dr. Rowe, who is based in NYC, detailed three buzzworthy procedures.\n\nFirst up, Botox cream. \u201cOne of the newest innovations in cosmetic surgery that\u2019s currently being tested in the European market is Botox cream, and it will be available in the US in 2020. This non-invasive iteration of Botox involves applying a cream, under the care of a physician, to the skin that relaxes the facial muscles and diminishes wrinkles caused by repetitive facial motions,\u201d explains Dr. Rowe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite revolutionary, as there are no shots, bruising or downtime involved, which are the most common complaints about standard neuromodulators,\u201d he continues. \u201cI can tell Botox cream will be popular, as patients are always looking for the effects of Botox without the needles, and this product offers similar results.\u201d\n\nNeedle-free Botox? Yes, please! Second on the list, breast implant removal. \u201cA growing trend in the industry is women opting to remove their implants either altogether or trading them in for smaller implants due to the concern over potential side effects some breast implants can have, such as Breast Implant Illness (BII) or cancer,\u201d details Dr. Rowe.\n\n\u201cBreast Implant Illness can refer to a wide variety of symptoms women with breast implants can experience as a result of having them, such as headaches, depression, chronic pain, brain fog, chest pain and much more. Additionally, there\u2019s a major societal shift where women are valuing a more natural-looking body shape and are choosing to get their implants removed or swapped out for smaller ones purely for aesthetic purposes.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Anastasia Karanikolaou/Instagram\n\nOne such celebrity includes Kylie Jenner\u2019s BFF Anastasia Karanikolaou. The 22-year-old influencer took to Instagram on December 2, 2019, to reveal she \u201cswitched\u201d her breast implants for \u201csmaller ones.\u201d\n\nAs for the third trend? Dr. Rowe includes nonsurgical penis augmentation. \u201cMen are increasingly getting plastic surgery and the procedure that grows rapidly in popularity is penis augmentation, a non-surgical injection procedure with little downtime that improves self-confidence, as well as his and his partner\u2019s pleasure,\u201d Dr. Rowe says.\n\n\u201cThe number of patients I see for this is up 25 percent over last year,\u201d he adds. \u201cI do about 30 of them a month. It definitely helps that they\u2019re more widely acceptable for men to go under the knife, minimally invasive and temporary, in case they have any cold feet.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t get enough celebrity content?
