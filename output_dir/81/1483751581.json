His production didn\u2019t warrant the team jumping through hoops. In the end, slowed further by a makeshift offensive line, the hero actually became a hindrance, forcing the Rams into an unsettling limbo while waiting for the burst that rarely came.\n\nAdvertisement They enter this offseason desperately needing to revitalize a scoring attack that precipitously fell from to 12th in NFL history to 11th in the league, meaning there\u2019s only one thing left to do with their declining star.\n\nRams Rams will need a new formula to get back to playoffs Rams Rams will need a new formula to get back to playoffs For the first time under coach Sean McVay, the Rams will miss the playoffs and will try to figure out what moves they can make to become contenders again. The Rams need to trade Todd Gurley.\n\nIt is not going to be easy. It\u2019s not going to be pretty. They won\u2019t reap a huge return.\n\nAnother team will have to agree to assume a chunk of the $60-million contract extension Gurley signed two summers ago. That narrows the field.\n\nAdvertisement Another team will have to believe that Gurley, even if he passes the requisite physical, can overcome the restrictions caused by his arthritic left knee. That narrows the field even further.\n\nGurley would be a nice fit for a playoff club looking for a specialty complementary backfield piece who still can throw out a stiff arm and carry a tackler a couple of yards into the end zone.\n\nThere are not many of those teams. The Rams need to find one. This will be a tough sell. The Rams need to sell it hard. This might take some time. The Rams need to do it before next season.\n\nRams Rams have plenty of roster decisions to make as they evaluate season Rams Rams have plenty of roster decisions to make as they evaluate season From Andrew Whitworth to Dante Fowler and Greg Zuerlein, the Rams have to figure how to reconfigure their roster so they can get back into the playoffs next season. More Coverage Chargers would be \u2018weird\u2019 without Philip Rivers, but there\u2019s no rush to decide future They cannot endure another autumn of Waiting For Todd, Hoping For Todd, Testing Out Todd, Talking About Todd \u2026 then looking up one day to see Gurley ranks 37th in the league at 3.8 yards per carry and they\u2019re out of the playoffs.\n\nThey can\u2019t play another game after which coach Sean McVay calls himself an idiot for not running Gurley, and Gurley doesn\u2019t disagree with him. Yet the real idiots were those of us who thought this odd arrangement could work. It couldn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t.\n\nThe load-management stuff turned out to be a load of you-know-what. When they finally unleashed Gurley in the final seven games of the season, they went 4-3. In their two biggest games during that stretch, against the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers, he accounted for 86 total yards on 29 touches.\n\nTwo seasons after being named NFL offensive player of the year, one season after leading the league in rushing touchdowns, Gurley finished this season as the league\u2019s 20th ranked running back, failing to gain 100 yards in any game.\n\nDuring his annual postseason interview session Tuesday, I asked Rams general manager Les Snead if Gurley was the same running back as in the past.\n\nAdvertisement \u201cThis year he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Snead acknowledged.\n\nTodd Gurley picks up yards during a game against the Bears on Nov. 17 at the Coliseum. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) He later clarified his statement to note that Gurley\u2019s performance was vulnerable to many factors, including an injury-riddled offensive line and defenses that focused on him.\n\n\u201cIf a runner doesn\u2019t have space early in the down \u2026 to accelerate \u2026 maybe there was less room this year,\u201d Snead said. \u201cYou felt that as you juggled the O-line, as teams adjusted to try to stop the run.\u201d\n\nSnead also noted that just because Gurley gained only 857 yards \u2014 nearly 500 yards fewer than his peak season in 2017, with nearly one yard fewer per carry \u2014 doesn\u2019t mean his greatness is finished.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen players have years that were less than the past come back and actually get back to where they were,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Snead\u2019s initial point was valid. Gurley was not Gurley. Can the Rams really afford to take the chance that he will ever be Gurley again?\n\nThe answer is no. The Rams can\u2019t afford to be content with 9-7. They can\u2019t afford the sort of inertia that will drive away their hard-won fans, not now.\n\nThey are moving into a new stadium. Their two cornerstone players \u2014 Aaron Donald and Jared Goff \u2014 are moving into the primes of their career. They have a roster still loaded with players just one year from appearing in the Super Bowl. They\u2019re in a suddenly strong division where simply a winning record will not guarantee the playoffs.\n\nChargers Chargers would be \u2018weird\u2019 without Philip Rivers, but there\u2019s no rush to decide future Chargers Chargers would be \u2018weird\u2019 without Philip Rivers, but there\u2019s no rush to decide future The Chargers must choose whether to bring back quarterback Philip Rivers next season, but Anthony Lynn is in no rush to make that decision or others. Advertisement They need to get better, and stay better, but how? They don\u2019t have the salary-cap space to add top free agents. They don\u2019t have a first-round draft pick for a couple of years. They don\u2019t have a lot of options other than draft well in later rounds and hope their current group of kids will grow up.\n\nThey need a quick jolt, the recharging of what was once a nearly unbeatable battery, and trading Gurley would provide that shock.\n\nIt would create cap space. It might net another late-round draft pick or two. Most important, it would clear out the backfield and allow Snead to plug in a veteran running back \u2014 or two \u2014 to consistently re-open the playbook for Goff.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible, then you weren\u2019t paying attention late in the 2018 season to the acquisition of a guy named C.J. Anderson. There might not ever be a replacement for a prime Gurley, but the Rams have proven there are certainly viable and more consistent substitutions for the current Gurley, and who knows, maybe Darrell Henderson also starts figuring it out.\n\nSome member of the community-minded Rams front office might worry about the fallout from trading Gurley, but they must understand something. He is not Clayton Kershaw. He is not Mike Trout. Gurley began his career in St. Louis, he starred here for a couple of years, but his quiet demeanor has kept him from making the necessary quick Los Angeles connection. Here\u2019s guessing most Rams fans would understand.\n\nWill Snead actually pull the trigger? Isn\u2019t this the same guy whose bold trades helped land them in the Super Bowl?\n\nWhen asked Tuesday whether any Rams player besides Goff and Donald were untouchable, Snead played coy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into that \u2026 because it can be misconstrued in many ways,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019d rather go, \u2018Hey, let me and our staff sit together and try to come up with the best plan on that.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat best plan should already be obvious. Trade Todd Gurley.\n\nLINK ORIGINAL: Latimes\n\nEntornointeligente.com", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["They", "Todd Gurley", "Rams", "NFL"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:01:15 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "es", "meta_favicon": "https://www.entornointeligente.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-logo_entornointeligente-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "es_ES", "type": "article", "title": "Column:\u00a0Rams have only one option left with Todd Gurley: Trade him", "description": "Entornointeligente.com / They tried resting him, and it didn\u2019t work.
