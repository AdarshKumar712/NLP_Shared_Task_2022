That would be a personal and professional embarrassment for a lot of reporters and editors, some of whom are currently in the middle of defending against lawsuits by the Covington teens.\n\nThe New York Times, for example, published an entire profile describing the Black Hebrew Israelites and their tactics in friendly, playful terms, including \u201cgamely engage,\u201d \"blunt and sometimes offensive,\u201d and \u201cattention-grabbing,\u201d but all for the purpose of \u201cdrawing listeners near.\u201d The profile is even sure to mention that a popular rapper once mentioned the group by name in a song.\n\nIt is still possible that Tuesday\u2019s shooting inspires a broader conversation about gun violence and the dangers posed by radical hate groups like the Black Hebrew Israelites.
