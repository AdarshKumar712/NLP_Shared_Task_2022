Kennedy proposed in the 1960s catalysed new technology such as the MRI scanner and satellite dishes, we want our Earthshot challenges to create a new wave of ambition and innovation around finding ways to help save the planet,\" says the official website.\n\nThe palace says William and a global alliance of philanthropists and organizations will work together to \"inspire the the planet\u2019s greatest problem solvers to solve Earth\u2019s greatest problems: the emergencies facing our natural world.\" The BBC says specific challenges will be launched, aiming to find at least 50 solutions to problems facing the planet. The palace says prizes \"could be awarded to a wide range of individuals, teams or collaborations\u2014scientists, activists, economists, leaders, governments, banks, businesses, cities, and countries\u2014anyone who is making a substantial development or outstanding contribution to solving these environmental challenges.\" Winners will get a financial award as well as public recognition for their projects that will, hopefully, inspire businesses and governments to join in the work.
