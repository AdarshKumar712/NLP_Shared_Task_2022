Sivan told a press conference.\n\n\"We are targeting the launch for this year but it may spillover to next year,\" Sivan said.

Up to three astronauts are to take part in the mission, which will be one of the landmark projects scheduled for the 75th anniversary of India's independence from British rule.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 10:25:07 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "India plans to make a fresh attempt to land an unmanned mission on the moon in 2020 after a failed bid last year, the head of the country's space programme said Wednesday.
