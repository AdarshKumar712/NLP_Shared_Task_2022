The tour will feature three Colonial Medical Insurance One-Day Internationals and three Sandals T20 Internationals from January 7 to 19.\n\nPenney has a strong record as a successful coach with various teams around the world. He is also a former player for Warwickshire County Cricket Club where he played 158 first-class matches and 291 List A matches in a career which spanned close to two decades. He has worked with several international teams as well with franchise teams. He was Head Coach of Sri Lanka, fielding coach of India, and consultant coach to the Netherlands.\n\nHe also served as assistant coach at King\u2019s XI Punjab, Deccan Chargers and Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League; as well as assistant coach with the St Lucia Zouks and St Kitts & Nevis Patriots in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL). Most recently he was part of the Barbados Trident coaching staff during their successful campaign in the 2019 CPL.\n\nWest Indies Head Coach, Phil Simmons said: \u201cTrevor is an excellent coach and has demonstrated this everywhere he has worked. He has huge experience with Sri Lanka and India at the highest international level, and in most T20 leagues around the world including the CPL. He brings enormous energy and is very well respected by all the players.\u201d\n\nPenney said: \u201cI\u2019m thrilled and excited to be given this opportunity to work with this brilliant bunch of cricketers and staff led by Kieron Pollard and Phil Simmons. I\u2019ve been lucky enough over the last few years to work with several members of the squad and the Caribbean is like \u2018home away from home\u2019 for me being involved in the CPL.\n\n\u201cWe have two big T20 World Cups coming up (in Australia 2020 and India 2021) and it\u2019s my aim to try and improve everybody and be as good as we can and hopefully win those two major ICC events for the great people of the West Indies.\u201d\n\nMATCH SCHEDULE\n\nSaturday, Jan 4: warm-up vs CWI President\u2019s XI \u2013 Three Ws Oval, Barbados\n\nTuesday, Jan 7: 1st Colonial Medical Insurance ODI \u2013 Kensington Oval, Barbados\n\nThursday, Jan 9: 2nd Colonial Medical Insurance ODI \u2013 Kensington Oval\n\nSunday, Jan 12: 3rd Colonial Medical Insurance ODI \u2013 Grenada National Stadium, Grenada\n\nWednesday, Jan 15: 1st Sandals Resorts T20I \u2013 Grenada National Stadium\n\nSaturday, Jan 18: 2nd Sandals Resorts T20I \u2013 Warner Park, St Kitts\n\nSunday, Jan 19: 3rd Sandals Resorts T20I \u2013 Warner Park\n\nTEAM MANAGEMENT\n\nPhil Simmons (Head Coach)\n\nRawl Lewis (Team Manager)\n\nRoddy Estwick (Assistant Coach)\n\nTrevor Penney (Assistant Coach)\n\nMonty Desai (Batting Coach)\n\nRonald Rogers (Strength & Conditioning Coach)\n\nDenis Byam (Physiotherapist)\n\nA.R.
