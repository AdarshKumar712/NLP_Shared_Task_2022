engineering faculty at Texas A&M University at Qatar brought together experts and practitioners from the United States, Europe and Qatar to focus on ensuring delivery of electric power in Qatar safely and reliably.\n\nPresented in partnership with VITO Middle East and Energyville, with funding support from the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), the Workshop on Safe and Reliable Electrical Distribution Systems for Qatar shared best practices, lessons learned and new technologies that are ready for application to enhance the safety and reliability of the electricity distribution systems in Qatar.\n\nWorkshop chair and associate professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Program at Texas A&M at Qatar Dr. Robert S. Balog , said that most of the electrical distribution system in Qatar is relatively new, certainly compared with US and European systems where there are well-known problems due to the aging infrastructure. But as solar energy becomes more widespread and electric vehicles gain traction, what will happen here in Qatar when equipment ages or is pushed beyond its intended design\n\nThe workshop aimed to leverage expertise at Texas A&M at Qatar and VITO to identify potential problems and develop paths and partnerships to form and implement Qatar-specific solutions.\n\nHowever, Balog said, more work may be needed to customize these technologies into solutions specific for Qatar, thereby necessitating a research ecosystem built around technology transfer to industry and the design, development, deployment and service of these technologies.\n\nDean of Texas A&M at Qatar, Dr. Cesar Octavio Malave, said, \u201cTexas A&M at Qatar is proud to have a strong partnership with academic institutions and local industry, as well as several government entities.\n\nOur mission is to play a key role in creating sustainable solutions to real-world challenges by generating new knowledge through research and collaborative partnerships, and then disseminating that knowledge to the rest of the world through scientific publications and workshops such as this one.\n\nTexas A&M at Qatar is committed to expanding the human capital of the State of Qatar that is essential to fuel innovation and new thinking.\u201d\n\nShare this post\n\n\n\n\n\nRead also\n\nRead More Ooredoo launches New Year offers for Shahry and Qatarna customers 01 Jan 2020 - 9:06 Both new customers signing up for a new Shahry 5G or Qatarna 5G pack, and existing customers upgrading to a new Shahry 5G or Qatarna 5G pack, can choose an Add-on pack \u2013 either extra data, local minutes or international minutes, depending on pack \u2013 absolutely free for three months.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Texas", "A&M", "University", "workshop", "focuses", "", "on", "electrical", "power", "infrastructure", "in", "Qatar"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Dean of Texas A&M at Qatar, Dr. Cesar Octavio Malave, said, \u201cTexas A&M at Qatar is proud to have a strong partnership with academic institutions and local industry, as well as several government entities.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/images/front/favicon.png?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "yandex-verification": "a7f51a0324104d5e", "keywords": "Texas, A&M, University, workshop, focuses, , on, electrical, power, infrastructure, in, Qatar", "description": "Dean of Texas A&M at Qatar, Dr. Cesar Octavio Malave, said, \u201cTexas A&M at Qatar is proud to have a strong partnership with academic institutions and local industry, as well as several government entities.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Dean of Texas A&M at Qatar, Dr. Cesar Octavio Malave, said, \u201cTexas A&M at Qatar is proud to have a strong partnership with academic institutions and local industry, as well as several government entities.", "title": "Texas A&M University workshop focuses  on electrical power infrastructure in Qatar", "site": "@peninsulaqatar"}, "og": {"title": "Texas A&M University workshop focuses  on electrical power infrastructure in Qatar", "url": "/article/01/01/2020/Texas-A-M-University-workshop-focuses-on-electrical-power-infrastructure-in-Qatar", "type": "article", "description": "Dean of Texas A&M at Qatar, Dr. Cesar Octavio Malave, said, \u201cTexas A&M at Qatar is proud to have a strong partnership with academic institutions and local industry, as well as several government entities.", "site_name": "The Peninsula Qatar", "locale": "en_us"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1664155270569632}, "DC.date.issued": "2020-01-01 09:12:00"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/01/01/2020/Texas-A-M-University-workshop-focuses-on-electrical-power-infrastructure-in-Qatar"}
