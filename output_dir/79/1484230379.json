It opened to the public earlier after becoming legal in 2019.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the fun colors on the table, the chips, the chairs,\u201d said Harrah\u2019s Hoosier Park, Vice President of Operations Todd Berendji.\n\nAll bets are on for the first time in the state, live and legal. There a variety of games to choose from, roulette, craps, blackjack, Mississippi Stud, and three-card poker.\n\nJanuary 1, 2020, marks the start of live table betting in the Hoosier state. The first to roll the dice on this special occasion was Pacers Point Guard Victor Oladipo.\n\n\u201cToday is a combination of at least 10 years of trying to find some kind of happy medium where we could bring table games to the community of Anderson, Indiana,\u201d said Berendji.\n\nBerendji says it\u2019s been a long time coming from hiring to training to recruiting. Indiana Grand in Shelbyville has also been doing the same. Berendji says Hoosiers asked and they received.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019ve heard, something that we\u2019ve wanted and something that rounds out the casinos for us,\u201d said Berendji.\n\nSomething he thinks will bring people from all over the state. State legislators are expecting table betting to bring nearly 3 million people to the Hoosier state every year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really grateful for Caesars for investing the amount of money they\u2019ve put into doing this for our community. Look at it, it\u2019s a huge huge crowd, people are excited its lots of fun,\u201d said Anderson Resident, Cindy Lanane.\n\nLots of fun that is expected to bring around 600 jobs from both locations. In Anderson, more than 200 have been hired for table games alone. The new element also adds to revenue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely increase revenue at both of our properties and we hope to increase the revenue here so we can support more of Anderson, Indiana, said Berendji.\n\nAnd the biggest highlight for Lanane wasn\u2019t playing on the live table it was who she played with.\n\n\u201cI got to play craps with Victor Oladipo,\u201d said Lanane.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["news", ""], "tags": ["Problem Solvers"], "authors": ["Darius Johnson"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "ANDERSON, Ind. --Some kicked off 2020 Wednesday afternoon at Harrah\u2019s Hoosier Park in Anderson for the first day of live table betting.
