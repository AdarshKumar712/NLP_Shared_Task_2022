To get the type of talent they did in Alberta\u2026it was just phenomenal,\u201d Drummer Chad Melchert explained.\n\nThe team is currently touring Canada, after completing more than 70 shows across the United States.\n\n\u201cWe do our show every day and we get on a bus and we go to sleep. We\u2019ve been very fortunate to see so many cities and meet so many great people. If this is the rock star life, then I\u2019ll take it!\u201d Melchert said.\n\nCheering from the sidelines are Queen\u2019s Brian May and Roger Taylor, who act as music supervisors.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cWe get video messages from them, wishing us luck on the tour,\u201d Melchert said.\n\n\u201cI would never have dreamed that would\u2019ve happened when I was listening to Queen as a kid. These guys, they revamped the music for us to play. It\u2019s pretty special.\u201d Tweet This\n\nMelchert, who lives in Morinville, said the Edmonton area is a hotbed of talent.\n\n\u201cYou can do anything from anywhere. Edmonton is a great place to do it. We have a great cultural scene. I\u2019m very proud to be from here.\u201d\n\nFor Edmonton actor Brian Christensen, performing at the Jubilee Auditorium feels like a homecoming.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen so many shows at the Jubilee. I would always think about what it would be like to be on the stage,\u201d Christensen said. Tweet This\n\n\u201cI came and saw The Lion King at the Jubilee a few years ago and I was close to the front of the stage. While they were doing bows and everyone was clapping, I turned around and faced the audience to see what it would be like to be on the stage.\u201d\n\nBeing on the stage is a powerful moment for many in the show, \u201cunder pressure\u201d to make it come alive.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an underbelly of arts in Edmonton and Calgary. We\u2019re all just waiting for an opportunity to show the rest of the country and the world what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Christensen said.\n\nREAD MORE: Edmonton man attends 27th Rolling Stones concert\n\nWhen the tour is over, Melchert will return to his regular gig playing with country singer Gord Bamford.\n\n\u201cAlberta is Alberta to me. It\u2019s really cool to work with a group of Albertans and Canadians. To have that Alberta connection is really cool. It\u2019s really comforting on the road.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Edmonton Theatre", "880 Edmonton features", "Jubilee", "Musical Theatre", "Performing arts", "Play", "Queen", "We Will Rock You", "Canada"], "tags": ["Musical Theatre", "We Will Rock You", "Edmonton Theatre", "Performing arts", "Queen", "880 Edmonton features", "Play", "Jubilee"], "authors": ["Morgan Black", "Global News", "Posted December", "Updated December"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A North American tour is making a few stops in Alberta, bringing many cast and crew members home for a performance.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/134ef81f5668dc78080f6bd19ca2310b?s=32", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#133F6F", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Alberta-based talent on tour backed by members of Queen - Edmonton | Globalnews.ca", "description": "A North American tour is making a few stops in Alberta, bringing many cast and crew members home for a performance.", "keywords": "Edmonton Theatre, 880 Edmonton features, Jubilee, Musical Theatre, Performing arts, Play, Queen, We Will Rock You, Canada", "news_keywords": "Edmonton Theatre, 880 Edmonton features, Jubilee, Musical Theatre, Performing arts, Play, Queen, We Will Rock You, Canada", "article": {"tag": "Canada"}, "og": {"title": "Alberta-based talent on tour backed by members of Queen", "description": "A North American tour is making a few stops in Alberta, bringing many cast and crew members home for a performance.", "type": "article", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/6351804/alberta-based-talent-on-tour-backed-by-members-of-queen/", "site_name": "Global News", "image": "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/we-will-rock-you-thumbnail.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"title": "Alberta-based talent on tour backed by members of Queen", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/6351804/alberta-based-talent-on-tour-backed-by-members-of-queen/", "description": "A North American tour is making a few stops in Alberta, bringing many cast and crew members home for a performance.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@globalnews", "image": "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/we-will-rock-you-thumbnail.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 318812448281278, "pages": 91251252807}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/6351804/alberta-based-talent-on-tour-backed-by-members-of-queen/?ia_markup=1"}, "application-name": "Global News", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://globalnews.ca/feed/;icon-uri=https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/134ef81f5668dc78080f6bd19ca2310b?s=16"}, "canonical_link": "http://globalnews.ca/news/6351804/alberta-based-talent-on-tour-backed-by-members-of-queen/"}
