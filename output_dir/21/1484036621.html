children should eat the same things they eat. That&#x27;s because the Toronto mom was surprised by the added sugars she found in products designed for infants and toddlers.</p>  <p>&quot;Those yogurt drinks were shocking. Low fat, all sugar,&quot; said Casgrain.</p>  <p>A recent study published in the <a href="https://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(19)31340-1/fulltext" target="_blank">Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</a> backs that up. It found that nearly 61 per cent of infants (6-11 months) and 98 per cent of toddlers (12-23 months) consumed added sugars as part of an average daily diet.</p>  <p>The added sugars were mainly found in flavoured yogurts and fruit drinks.</p>  <p>&quot;We wanted to understand what the consumption of added sugars were among infants and toddlers. It&#x27;s a group that&#x27;s not very well studied, so we wanted to add to the research base,&quot; said lead investigator Kirsten Herrick, with the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.</p>  <div><span><figure class="imageMedia image full"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholderImage" style="padding-bottom:60.97%"></div><img alt="" srcSet="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3899736.1481896966!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/healthmatters-limiting-sugar-20140303.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3899736.1481896966!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/healthmatters-limiting-sugar-20140303.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3899736.1481896966!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/healthmatters-limiting-sugar-20140303.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3899736.1481896966!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/healthmatters-limiting-sugar-20140303.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3899736.1481896966!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/healthmatters-limiting-sugar-20140303.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3899736.1481896966!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/healthmatters-limiting-sugar-20140303.jpg"/></div><figcaption class="image-caption">Nutrition experts warn us to try to limit our intake of added sugars, but they are everywhere: in breakfast cereals, baked goods, even yogurt and pasta sauces.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Jonathan Hayward/Canadian Press)</figcaption></figure></span></div>  <p>Herrick&#x27;s team analyzed data from 1,211 young children.

It could be table sugar, honey, maple syrup or fruit concentrate. And it&#x27;s &quot;everywhere in the food system,&quot; she said, from fruit drinks and baked goods, to yogurts.</p>  <p>Jess Haines, an associate professor of applied nutrition at the University of Guelph, isn&#x27;t surprised by the findings.</p>  <p>&quot;Kids eat like we do. And adults, both in the U.S and Canada, we eat a fair bit of sugar,&quot; she said.</p>  <p>Haines said the university came to similar conclusions in its long-term <a href="https://guelphfamilyhealthstudy.com/" target="_blank">Guelph Family Health Study</a>, where researchers looked at various routines of children between 18 months and five years of age. When it came to diet, it found that 54 per cent of them exceeded the six teaspoons of sugar per day.</p>  <div><span><figure class="imageMedia image full"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholderImage" style="padding-bottom:66.77%"></div><img alt="" srcSet="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5403101.1576788048!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/jess-haines-with-the-university-of-guelph.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5403101.1576788048!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/jess-haines-with-the-university-of-guelph.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5403101.1576788048!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/jess-haines-with-the-university-of-guelph.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5403101.1576788048!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/jess-haines-with-the-university-of-guelph.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5403101.1576788048!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/jess-haines-with-the-university-of-guelph.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5403101.1576788048!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/jess-haines-with-the-university-of-guelph.jpg"/></div><figcaption class="image-caption"> Jess Haines is an associate professor of applied nutrition at the University of Guelph.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Craig Chivers/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></div>  <p>Haines says that all this added sugar can have long-term health effects, starting with cavities.</p>  <p>&quot;We also see that when kids have higher intakes of sugar that&#x27;s sustained over their lifetime, we can see an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes later in life.&quot;</p>  <p>As a parent herself, Haines understands that many babies and toddlers can be picky eaters.
