They have allowed racism in the Labour Party to be \u2026 normalised. They have failed us when we needed them most. They enabled Mr Corbyn and his friends to make us a target.\u201d \u200b\n\nIn the latest salvo in the increasingly bitter battle to succeed Corbyn, Mr Lavery used an article in the Daily Mirror to warn against a return to what he termed the \u201cbland centrism\u201d of pre-2015 leaders such as Ed Miliband.\n\nThe Wansbeck MP has said he is \u201cseriously considering\u201d throwing his hat into the ring for the leadership contest due to get under way formally later this month.\n\nHis entry would risk splitting the left-wing vote with Rebecca Long Bailey, who has so far been viewed as the \u201ccontinuity Corbyn\u201d candidate.\n\nOnly shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and economy spokesperson Clive Lewis have so far declared their intention to stand in what is expected to be a wide field vying to replace Corbyn.\n\n\u2018For Labour to win again we need to understand why we lost,\u2019 says Lavery (Chris McAndrew/UK Parliament) More\n\nMr Lavery left no doubt in his article that he would stick to the programme \u2013 set out by Mr Corbyn \u2013 of nationalisations and tax hikes for corporations and the rich.\n\nHe said that the offer of a second referendum on Brexit was to blame for driving voters away, and accused the \u201carchitects of our defeat\u201d of attempting to rewrite history.\n\n\u201cTo survive, we must understand why we lost and articulate a bold vision for the future,\u201d wrote Mr Lavery.\n\n\u201cIt seems ridiculous to point out it was not our policies that led to defeat.\n\n\u201cFor some, that would be a neat conclusion allowing them to return to a bland centrism of 2015. But it isn\u2019t true.\n\n\u201cLabour lost because of our Brexit position, infighting, a collapse of industry in our communities and a lack of trust in our ability to deliver.\u201d\n\nTalk of a second referendum was seen by many traditional Labour voters as \u201ca way to foist Remain upon them\u201d, he said. \u201cCommunities represented by Labour for generations felt abandoned. It is time to outline a positive vision of the future outside of the EU.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["leadership contest", "Neil Coyle", "Jeremy Corbyn", "Ian Lavery", "antisemitism", "Clive Lewis", "Ruth Smeeth", "Labour", "Emily Thornberry"], "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 11:29:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A potential left-wing candidate for the Labour leadership has come under fire after claiming that Brexit, and not Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policies, was to blame for the party\u2019s landslide defeat in last month\u2019s election.Party chair Ian Lavery said Labour had to earn its \u201cright to exist\u201d by rebuilding the trust", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@yahooNewsUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A potential left-wing candidate for the Labour leadership has come under fire after claiming that Brexit, and not Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policies, was to blame for the party\u2019s landslide defeat in last month\u2019s election.Party chair Ian Lavery said Labour had to earn its \u201cright to exist\u201d by rebuilding the trust", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ky2.SiGyso5AYrrvyc62Tg--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/1a4c87030abc4604dff0121011e13b03", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ky2.SiGyso5AYrrvyc62Tg--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/1a4c87030abc4604dff0121011e13b03"}, "title": "Ian Lavery: Labour leadership hopeful says party\u2019s offer of a second Brexit referendum was to blame for landslide election defeat"}, "summary": "Latest News, World & UK News Headlines", "robots": "noindex", "news_keywords": "Jeremy Corbyn, Ian Lavery, Brexit, Labour, Jewish Labour Movement, Party chair, Neil Coyle, Ruth Smeeth", "googlebot": "noindex", "bingbot": "noindex", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=96a13164-09ff-3863-8180-4dd0c14dcb70&src=web", "description": "A potential left-wing candidate for the Labour leadership has come under fire after claiming that Brexit, and not Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policies, was to blame for the party\u2019s landslide defeat in last month\u2019s election.Party chair Ian Lavery said Labour had to earn its \u201cright to exist\u201d by rebuilding the trust", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ky2.SiGyso5AYrrvyc62Tg--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/1a4c87030abc4604dff0121011e13b03", "description": "A potential left-wing candidate for the Labour leadership has come under fire after claiming that Brexit, and not Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policies, was to blame for the party\u2019s landslide defeat in last month\u2019s election.Party chair Ian Lavery said Labour had to earn its \u201cright to exist\u201d by rebuilding the trust", "title": "Ian Lavery: Labour leadership hopeful says party\u2019s offer of a second Brexit referendum was to blame for landslide election defeat", "url": "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/ian-lavery-labour-leadership-hopeful-112900326.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 115060728528067}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=96a13164-09ff-3863-8180-4dd0c14dcb70&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=96a13164-09ff-3863-8180-4dd0c14dcb70&src=web"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/ian-lavery-labour-leadership-hopeful-112900326.html"}
