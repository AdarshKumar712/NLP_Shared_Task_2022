But till date, no action has been taken in these orders and LIP will soon file a contempt petition in the Punjab And Haryana high court The government had recently decided to decision ease case on an individual basis to ensure that the panchayats get their dues. It had been proposed to insert Rule 12-B in the \u2018Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Rules, 1964\u2019 to provide special provision for transfer of \u2018Shamlat lands\u2019 (consolidation of landholdings for common use) for development of industrial infrastructure projects.However, Bains said the LIP has decided to launch a statewide campaign against these amendments and will visit all villages where attempts are being made to encroach upon the common land. He said the party will erect special flags on these lands and fight against mutation of these properties.Meanwhile, Bains reiterated that they have supported the cause raised by Shiromani Akali Dal veteran leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and will stand by him.In regard with the hike in power cost, Bains said Captain Amarinder has failed to fulfil the poll promise of providing power at Rs 5 a unit and instead he was blaming the SAD-BJP government for having signed the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with the private players. The government could have scrapped these PPAs and started afresh to provide relief to the people of the state, he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Ludhiana news", "Ludhiana latest news", "Ludhiana news live", "Ludhiana news today", "Today news Ludhiana", "Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa", "Simarjit Singh Bains", "shiromani akali dal", "Punjab and Haryana high court", "patiala", "Industrial Infrastructure"], "tags": ["Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa", "Shiromani Akali Dal", "Delhi Earthquake", "Chennai Rains", "Bangalore Rains", "Srinagar encounter", "Mumbai Rains", "Simarjit Singh Bains", "Punjab And Haryana high court", "Mumbai Floods", "industrial infrastructure", "Madras High Court", "Delhi Pollution"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "PATIALA: While Punjab cabinet recently gave in-principle approval to amend the Punjab Village Common Land (Regulation) Rules, 1964, to create land ban.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "PATIALA: While Punjab cabinet recently gave in-principle approval to amend the Punjab Village Common Land (Regulation) Rules, 1964, to create land ban.", "keywords": "Ludhiana news, Ludhiana latest news, Ludhiana news live, Ludhiana news today, Today news Ludhiana,Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa,Simarjit Singh Bains,shiromani akali dal,Punjab and Haryana high court,patiala,Industrial Infrastructure", "og": {"title": "Simarjit Singh Bains to challenge land banking bill to be introduced by Punjab government | Ludhiana News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/simarjit-singh-bains-to-challenge-land-banking-bill-to-be-introduced-by-punjab-government/articleshow/73058316.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73060216,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-392080,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "PATIALA: While Punjab cabinet recently gave in-principle approval to amend the Punjab Village Common Land (Regulation) Rules, 1964, to create land ban.", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/simarjit-singh-bains-to-challenge-land-banking-bill-to-be-introduced-by-punjab-government/articleshow/73058316.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73060216,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-392080,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "Simarjit Singh Bains to challenge land banking bill to be introduced by Punjab government | Ludhiana News - Times of India", "description": "PATIALA: While Punjab cabinet recently gave in-principle approval to amend the Punjab Village Common Land (Regulation) Rules, 1964, to create land ban.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/simarjit-singh-bains-to-challenge-land-banking-bill-to-be-introduced-by-punjab-government/articleshow/73058316.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 26781952138, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0", "robots": "NOODP"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/simarjit-singh-bains-to-challenge-land-banking-bill-to-be-introduced-by-punjab-government/articleshow/73058316.cms"}
