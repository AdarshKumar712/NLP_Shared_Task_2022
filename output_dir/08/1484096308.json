While dozens of Democrat governors quickly moved to assure the federal government that they would keep taking in and resettling these refugees, others on the Republican side hesitated. On Monday, one of those Republicans came to a decision: Gov. Mike Parson of Missouri told the State Department that his state would continue to welcome refugees.\n\n\u201cMissouri has a long and rich history of immigration, dating back to America\u2019s earliest explorers, fur traders, and missionaries,\u201d Parson said in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \u201cToday, Missouri\u2019s population includes thousands of refugees who have become vital members of our communities.\u201d\n\nAccording to Parson, Missouri has resettled more than 18,000 refugees from 45 countries since 2002.\n\n\u201cMissouri will continue to work hard to ensure refugees become a thriving part of our communities, and I am confident this demonstration of compassion will mark the first step in these immigrants becoming patriotic and productive fellow Americans,\u201d Parson wrote.\n\nParson said he would continue to work with five agencies who have helped to resettle refugees in St. Louis, Springfield, and other Missouri cities.\n\n\u201cThese groups do an excellent job of transitioning newly settled populations, ensuring they are educated, trained and prepared to assimilate into their community,\u201d Parson said.\n\nWhile we didn\u2019t exactly hear any cheers coming up from the people that voted Parson into office, Anna Crosslin of the International Institute of St. Louis was certainly happy to hear the news.\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly excited and gratified to learn that Missouri will remain a welcoming state for refugees from war-torn countries around the world since Governor Parson has given consent for continued resettlement,\u201d said Crosslin. \u201cRefugees are important assets to our communities, culturally and economically. With the right kind of resettlement assistance from agencies and our faith communities, these newcomers quickly become workers, shop owners, neighbors and friends.\u201d\n\nJust look at how quickly they can replace the native-born population! It\u2019s wonderful!\n\nWell, just goes to show you (again) that just because you\u2019ve got an (R) next to your name, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re working for the good of the American people. Maybe someone should primary this fool.\n\n\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 18:22:57 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://totalconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/favicon.jpg", "meta_data": {"og": {"image": {"identifier": "http://totalconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/parson.jpeg", "width": 800, "height": 532}, "title": "Missouri\u2019s GOP Governor Says State Will Keep Resettling Refugees - Total Conservative News", "type": "article", "description": "Several months ago, President Donald Trump put the power of discernment back in the hands of the people when he gave each state the right to decide whether or not they would continue to accept refugees welcomed into the United States.
