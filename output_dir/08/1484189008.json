The new year brings with it new life and new opportunities, and for many it is a good time to reflect on ways to improve and to set goals to attack with renewed focus.\n\nAfter a decade of irrelevance the Pistons are nearing a low-point for the franchise and need to take a hard look in the mirror. Here are three New Year\u2019s resolutions the Pistons should pledge to adhere to over the coming months.\n\nI will not play Blake Griffin until he is healthy\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a medical degree or advanced basketball expertise to see that Blake Griffin is not healthy. He is moving slowly, often with a limp, has no lift around the rim, and even his three-point shots are flat due to a leg that is clearly not fully recovered. Griffin has career low numbers in just about everything, shooting an abysmal 24.3 percent from three-point range and 35.2 percent overall and scoring just 15.5 points per game.\n\nHis PER is nearly twenty points below his career average and even a casual fan could use the eye test to conclude that Griffin just isn\u2019t right. With a long injury history Griffin is unlikely to ever be 100 percent again but the Pistons should sit him until he is close. There are several reasons this resolution makes sense:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["NBA All-Star Weekend"], "authors": ["Aaron Ferguson", "Steven Bryant", "Paul Kasabian", "Nicolas Henkel", "Steven Garcia"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "With both a brand new year and a brand new decade here in the NBA, the Detroit Pistons should have a few New Year's Resolutions.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://pistonpowered.com/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "With both a brand new year and a brand new decade here in the NBA, the Detroit Pistons should have a few New Year's Resolutions.", "DC.date.issued": "2020-01-01T14:00:18-05:00", "generator": "WordPress 4.9.13", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@PistonPowered", "title": "3 New Year\u2019s Resolutions for the Detroit Pistons", "description": "With both a brand new year and a brand new decade here in the NBA, the Detroit Pistons should have a few New Year's Resolutions.
