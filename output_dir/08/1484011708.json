Basically, Government debt is the money owed by the central government to its creditors. There are two types of government debt: net and gross. Gross debt is the accumulation of outstanding government debt which may be in the form of government bonds, credit default swaps, currency swaps, special drawing rights, loans, insurance and pensions. Net debt is the difference between gross debt and the financial assets that government holds. The higher the debt-to-GDP ratio, the less likely the country will pay its debt back, and more likely the country is to default on its debt obligations.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Euro Area Government Debt To GDP", "Chart Graph", "Data", "Historical Data"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Contact Tradingeconomics.Com"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Government Debt in the Euro Area was last reported at 85.1 percent of the country\u00b4s GDP.
