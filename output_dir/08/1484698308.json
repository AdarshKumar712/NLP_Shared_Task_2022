She can stay out of the public eye as long as she wants.\u201d\n\nGoldman added that despite Maxwell going into hiding, she remains sure she won\u2019t face consequences for allegedly procuring underage women for Epstein.\n\n\u201cGhislaine is so confident that she\u2019ll be back that she\u2019s still texting friends in different social circles while she\u2019s in hiding,\u201d Goldman said.\n\n\u201cShe obviously has some serious dirt on someone to be so sure of herself in the circumstances,\u201d she added.\n\nNotably, despite Maxwell maintaining her innocence, she was was apparently \u201crelieved\u201d after learning of Epstein\u2019s suspicious death from his Manhattan jail cell, because the disgraced pedophile wouldn\u2019t be able to turn on her.\n\n\u201cShe was more relieved than anything,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cIt may have placed her more in the spotlight but at least he couldn\u2019t turn on her.\u201d\n\nThe FBI reportedly is aware of Maxwell\u2019s whereabouts and is \u201cbuilding a case against her,\u201d according to lawyer Spencer Kuvin, who is representing several of Epstein\u2019s victims.\n\n\u201cI think ultimately they are building a case and know where she is and they\u2019re just not letting on, much like they did with Mr Epstein, who, when he stepped foot in the US, they just arrested him,\u201d Kuvin said last month. \u201cNobody knew that, they didn\u2019t broadcast it, they didn\u2019t tell anyone he was traveling here, they just did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnytime she travels, the federal government is going to know where she is because there are flight logs required for every type of travel, whether it\u2019s private jet or commercial, the federal government, through the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration], has flight logs and international organizations also have flight logs,\u201d he added.\n\nAnother source close to Maxwell told The Sun that if she goes down, she\u2019s taking a lot of powerful people down with her.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an incredibly intelligent, cunning character and you can bet she\u2019ll have a lot of tricks up her sleeve still \u2013 even though she\u2019s up to her neck in trouble through her association with Epstein,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s going down, you can bet a lot of others will be going down with her.\u201d\n\nBelow: Shock videos show young girls dressed as stewardesses being used to lure other young women into the elite world of private executive jet travel while enticing men to join their club.\n\ninfowars.com/untouchable-ghislaine-maxwell-has-serious-dirt-on-elites-confident-wont-face-charges-for-epstein-pedophile-network/", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.teaparty.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Favicon-Tea-Party.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "google-site-verification": "BUmroTlpSK6UfDeL-RF65T8u9-kL5ZhBtj6sufpwNGY"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.teaparty.org/untouchable-ghislaine-maxwell-has-serious-dirt-on-elites-confident-wont-face-charges-for-epstein-pedophile-network-423021/"}
