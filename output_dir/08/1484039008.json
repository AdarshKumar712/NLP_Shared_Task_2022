They also stated that there was a police presence around the group, which seemed to anger the party even more that much needed public resources had been used to protect such an \u2018outrageous demonstration\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post received hundreds of shares and comments, with one claiming: \u201cIts not normal that these women are lying on the floor as if they were dead and little children are passing and watching something they can\u2019t even understand. Mind-blowing.\u201d\n\n\n\nGeplaatst door VOX Alicante \u2013 Ciudad op Zondag 29 december 2019\n\nAnother simply said the act was \u201cShameful\u201d whilst one user responded and said: \u201cAs a woman I am ashamed to see this, long live the freedom of expression but not this. I find it to be ridiculous and it is not something I want my children to see.\u201d\n\nOthers made light of the situation, stating \u201cWhat a way to relieve a hangover\u201d with another stating that they should be swept up with a broom and cleared from the streets with one person agreeing that the fire brigade should \u201cshoo them away.\u201d\n\nAlthough it is not known exactly why this \u2018naked protest\u2019 took place, some believed it to be an action from a group of activists who wanted to give visibility to gender-violence in Spain. The cases of women subject to domestic violence across the country has risen to dramatic proportions over the last few years, with many groups hoping to show the plight of abused women in a range of demonstrations.\n\nHowever, the person managing the Vox Alicante Facebook account disagreed, and said that they were informed by the police that the protest was against animal cruelty, an equally alarming issue where the growing number of abused animals is now being highlighted across the country.\n\nFor those that simply do not agree that the protest was appropriate to be carried out in broad daylight on New Year\u2019s Day, it has seemed to garner exactly the attention that it sought.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Spain news", "newspaper", "Spain", "Spanish News", "Euro Weekly News", "latest spain", "Outrage as Spain\u2019s largest department store comes under siege from naked bodies"], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "AN UNFAMILIAR and unexpected site appeared outside Spain's largest department store today (January 1), causing a wave of outrage in the local Spanish", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "AN UNFAMILIAR and unexpected site appeared outside Spain's largest department store today (January 1), causing a wave of outrage in the local Spanish", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Outrage as Spain\u2019s largest department store comes under siege from naked bodies - Euro Weekly News Spain", "description": "AN UNFAMILIAR and unexpected site appeared outside Spain's largest department store today (January 1), causing a wave of outrage in the local Spanish", "url": "https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2020/01/01/outrage-as-spains-largest-department-store-comes-under-siege-from-naked-bodies/", "site_name": "Euro Weekly News Spain", "updated_time": "2020-01-01T19:27:41+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/81250975_1174168759456041_6252398851605397504_n.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/81250975_1174168759456041_6252398851605397504_n.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 600}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/EuroWeeklyNews", "tag": "Spanish News", "section": "Spain", "published_time": "2020-01-01T15:59:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T19:27:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "AN UNFAMILIAR and unexpected site appeared outside Spain's largest department store today (January 1), causing a wave of outrage in the local Spanish", "title": "Outrage as Spain\u2019s largest department store comes under siege from naked bodies - Euro Weekly News Spain", "site": "@euroweeklynews", "image": "https://www.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/81250975_1174168759456041_6252398851605397504_n.jpg", "creator": "@euroweeklynews"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "theme-color": "#d33"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2020/01/01/outrage-as-spains-largest-department-store-comes-under-siege-from-naked-bodies/"}
