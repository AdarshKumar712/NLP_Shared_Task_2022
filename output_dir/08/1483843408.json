It states that the two countries must inform each other of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the agreement on the first of January of every calendar year.\n\nBoth India and Pakistan possess nuclear weapons and, along with Israel and South Sudan, they are not parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\n\nLast year, when relations between the two south Asian countries reached a nadir, leaders from Pakistan threatened India with nuclear attack while Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also announced his country might consider changing its nuclear weapons doctrine by doing away with a \u201cno first use policy\u201d in the future.\n\nIndian Army Chief MM Naravane on Tuesday also emphasised that If Pakistan does not stop \"its policy of state-sponsored terrorism\", India reserves the right to preemptively strike at the sources of the terror threat.\n\n\"This intent has adequately been demonstrated in our response during surgical strikes and Balakot operation\", the Naravane said.\n\nIn the midst of heightened tensions between India and Pakistan after the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status in August 2019, Pakistan recalled its diplomat and also sent back India\u2019s representative from Islamabad.\n\nThe Imran Khan-led Pakistan government raised the issue at every international forum, giving a clarion call to the world leaders to intervene for the benefit of the region.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Nuclear Attack", "Nuclear Weapons", "India Pakistan Rivalry", "Nuclear Installation", "Disputed Kashmir", "Indian state of Jammu and
