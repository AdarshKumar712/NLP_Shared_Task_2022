The Seahawks defeated the Eagles 17-9. (Photo: Jerry Habraken, Delaware News Journal)\n\nNeedless to say, it didn't go well as the Eagles committed five turnovers \u2013 four by Wentz with two lost fumbles and two interceptions \u2013 in their 17-9 loss.\n\nThe Eagles fell to 5-7 after losing the following week to Miami. They haven't lost since, winning four straight games despite a brand new cast of skill position players, most of whom the Seahawks haven't seen when the two teams play on Sunday in the NFC Wildcard Round of the playoffs.\n\nSEASON SAVIORS: Ranking the Eagles' 10 former practice squad players by their importance\n\n\"I think it\u2019s been different bodies out there, different guys making the plays, but Coach (Doug Pederson) has been putting together an awesome game plan each week and executing it and calling it really well, so I can just play fast and take what the defense gives me,\" Wentz said.\n\n\"And guys have been making plays. I\u2019ve said that over and over now. It\u2019s someone different every week. We saw Boston Scott last week. What was he, the (NFC) offensive player of the week? How cool is that? It\u2019s finding ways to get the ball in playmakers hands and it\u2019s my job to distribute it.\"\n\nSEAHAWKS AGAIN: Eagles to face Seahawks in NFL playoff game, with chance to avenge regular-season loss\n\nScott didn't touch the ball at all in that first game against Seattle. Yet last Sunday against the Giants, Scott took over when Miles Sanders left with an injury in the second quarter and had 138 yards from scrimmage and scored three touchdowns in the Eagles' 34-17 win.\n\nIt's the same way with Ward. The first game against Seattle was only his second game on a game-day roster after spending parts of each of the last three seasons on the Eagles' practice squad.\n\nWard had his first NFL reception in that game, finishing with 6 catches for 40 yards. He has been the Eagles' leading receiver since, with 28 receptions, along with 254 yards and a touchdown. A week later, Hollins was released, while Jeffery has since gone on injured reserve, and Agholor has missed the last four games.\n\nEagles. Phillies. College and high school sports.

They have the same-style type of guys of really exciting football players. They know how to use their guys. We\u2019re just going to expect them to continue to do what they do.\"\n\nBut that has taken some time.\n\nThe Seahawks game was really the first time Wentz was playing with a new set of skill position players. That has continued to evolve as the weeks have gone on. Yet the Eagles have adjusted in must-win games in order to make the playoffs.\n\n\"We\u2019ve had some moving parts,\" Scott said. \"Guys have gone down. Guys have had to step up. At the end of the day, I feel like Carson has been putting us in good situations. It doesn\u2019t really matter who\u2019s in there. He\u2019s kind of making that thing go. He\u2019s our leader, and we have confidence in him, and he\u2019s been putting us in positions to succeed.\"\n\nIn the last few days alone, Brooks went on injured reserve with a shoulder injury; tight end Zach Ertz missed last week's game with hip and back injuries and might not return this week; and Johnson has missed the last three games with a high-ankle sprain, and it's not known if he can return this week, either.\n\nCLOSE\n\nIn that first game, rookie Andre Dillard, who had played left tackle ever since he began playing football, played right tackle and was benched at halftime for Halapoulivaati Vaitai, and Matt Pryor got into his first-ever NFL game at right guard.\n\nPryor played in the second half against the Giants last Sunday, and would be prepared to start if needed again Sunday.\n\nThe Seahawks have dealt with a similar situation over the past few weeks, when they lost 3 of their last 4 games. Their top three running backs in Chris Carson (1,230 yards rushing), Rashaad Penny (129 yards rushing vs. the Eagles) and C.J. Prosise have all suffered season-ending injuries.\n\nThe Seahawks last week signed veteran running back Marshawn Lynch. He hadn't played at all this season until last Sunday night in Seattle's 26-21 loss to San Francisco.\n\n\"We have to just deal with what\u2019s been dealt to us,\" Carroll said. \"Just make the adjustments and count on the guys to come through and make the plays, and play like the guy who just left. I know (the Eagles) have done a great job of that, overcoming tremendous odds. We\u2019re up against a little bit now.\n\n\"Obviously, there\u2019s a big survival challenge for both teams.\"\n\nInjury update\n\nBoth Johnson and Ertz were limited participants in practice Wednesday, which was a walkthrough session. Eagles coach Doug Pederson said Ertz has not been cleared for contact, so unless that changes by Sunday, he won't play. Johnson has missed three straight games with an ankle injury.\n\nWR Nelson Agholor, who has missed 5 of the last 6 games with a knee injury, didn't practice. Neither did Sanders. Pederson said a decision on Sanders will be made later in the week.\n\nEagles sign a WR\n\nThe Eagles placed Brooks on injured reserve Wednesday and signed WR Shelton Gibson. Gibson was the Eagles' fifth-round pick in 2017. He was waived in August, and spent the season on the Cleveland Browns' practice squad. Gibson has 3 career catches for 59 yards in 2017 and 2018.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.
