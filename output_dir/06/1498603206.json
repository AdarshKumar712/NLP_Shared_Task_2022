Kristi Noem said the storms, tornadoes and flooding that devastated communities across the state was one of the biggest challenges she faced in her first year in office, in a wide-ranging interview in which she also promised to focus on growing the economy and improving her working relationship with lawmakers in the new year.\n\nThe first-term Republican governor called it \u201ca difficult year, all in all, for the state\u201d due to flooding that strained state resources and had her administration working overtime and traveling thousands of miles to respond to disasters. Noem said she had successes, naming her work to encourage foster families, address drug addiction and spread broadband internet access in rural areas.\n\nAnd she also called herself \u201cteachable,\u201d a nod to some lawmakers who said she failed to communicate well on some policy decisions.\n\nThe former congresswoman took office in January last year, and almost as soon as the Legislature ended found herself leading the state\u2019s response to severe storms in March and April that laid the foundation for what seemed a year of flooding.\n\nSouth Dakota recorded the highest amount of precipitation in its history, beating the previous mark set in 1915. By the end of November, South Dakota already had more than 30 inches of precipitation, topping 1915\u2019s mark of just under 28 inches, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Floods and tornadoes caused millions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage and the state led the nation in unplanted farmland.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re focused on getting priorities and the state budget passed, and immediately went into getting people through a crisis situation and helping them recover,\u201d Noem said.\n\nThe state got four presidential disaster declarations, in addition to the Oglala Sioux Tribe receiving one for storms and flooding. Noem\u2019s administration is offering loans to counties, towns and tribes to fund recovery.\n\nNoem acknowledged concerns about more flooding in 2020 with the forecast calling for a wet winter. That could add to the difficulty for farmers, who left nearly 4 million acres unplanted. The slump in the state\u2019s largest industry affected South Dakota\u2019s economy and budget.\n\nNoem said she\u2019ll respond by focusing on \u201cgrowing our economy together\u201d next year.\n\nWhen asked to assess her first year in office, Noem declined to grade herself. She said she wanted to remain \u201cteachable\u201d and acknowledged she could do a better job communicating \u201cso that people know not just what we\u2019re doing, but why and the reason behind it.\u201d\n\nLegislative leaders from both parties said they were sometimes frustrated by a disjointed relationship between Noem\u2019s administration and the Republican-dominated legislature. Senate Majority Leader Kris Langer, a Republican from Dell Rapids, said she felt Noem\u2019s second session would be smoother, with legislation on mental health and addiction treatment in the works and both Noem and majority Republicans in support.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Troy Heinert, D-Mission, worried that the recent departure of the governor\u2019s chief of staff would be a setback heading into the session.\n\nNoem drew national attention in November for the state\u2019s \u201cMeth: We\u2019re on it\u201d campaign, which received some snickers on social media. She defended the campaign, saying it was achieving its goal of drawing attention to a serious problem. Noem said she knew the campaign was \u201cprovocative,\u201d but was surprised by the amount of attention it received. She plans to follow the $1.4 million ad campaign with funding for addiction treatment and law enforcement.\n\nTo get that funding, the legislature will have to pass it in the budget. The session begins on Jan. 14 when Noem will deliver her second State of the State address.\n\n\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Steve Groves", "Associated Press - Updated", "Week Ago", "Posted Jan"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"description": "Overview of South Dakota events in 2019", "image": "https://plainsman.com/uploads/images/2020/01/91226e7f28ed3898fa8b20239312b788.jpg", "title": "Noem: Weather among biggest challenges in first year", "site_name": "Huron Plainsman", "type": "article"}}, "canonical_link": ""}
