The weapon was deployed with a missile division in the Orenburg region 900 miles southeast of Moscow.\n\nAvangard is a nuclear-armed boost-glide system. The glider is boosted high into the atmosphere atop a Sarmat ICBM, and then glides down to its target at what Russia claims is a speed of Mach 27. The weapon was spurred by Moscow\u2019s fears that the U.S. missile defense program will eventually be capable of intercepting and destroying conventional Russian ICBMs, and thus encourage America to launch a first strike without fear of Russian nuclear retaliation. But while conventional ICBM warheads descend from space at Mach 20-plus, they follow predictable ballistic trajectories: a winged hypersonic glider can maneuver within the atmosphere to avoid interception.\n\nPutin \u201chas the Avangard\u2019s ability to evade U.S. missile defense systems,\u201d noted the Moscow Times. \u201cRussia said it showed the missile system to U.S. inspectors last month as part of a bilateral arms control treaty ahead of its deployment.\u201d\n\n\u201cOfficials say the ICBM flies 27 times faster than the speed of sound. During the last known tests that took place in December 2018, the Avangard hit a practice target 6,000 kilometers [3,728 miles] away.\u201d\n\nPutin recently claimed that \u201cthis weapon of the future can penetrate both existing and any future missile defense systems.\u201d Other Russian hypersonic weapons include the nuclear-armed Khinzal air-launched missile, and the Zircon anti-ship missile.\n\nInterestingly, Putin also described Russia being the first nation to deploy hypersonic missiles as being \u201ca unique situation in our contemporary history where they\u2019re trying to catch up.\u201d Which suggests that Putin considers it the norm for Russia to be trying to catch up in the arms race.\n\nRead the original article.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Michael Peck"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 08:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Moscow might not even need them.
