It was a contest of momentum against the Flames, with the Blackhawks jumping out to an early four-goal lead before watching their hosts put up a big rally.\n\nA goal in the closing moments of the second period and two more in the third got the lead down to one, but fittingly Patrick Kane was able to seal the Blackhawks\u2019 victory.\n\nArguably the team\u2019s player of the decade, the forward completed his four-point night with his second goal into the empty net to complete the victory. It was the team\u2019s third-straight victory and puts the Blackhawks over the .500 mark at 18-17-6 as 2019 comes to an end.\n\nWith a couple of memorable saves along the way, Robin Lehner turned in another yeoman\u2019s effort in net, stopping 41-of-44 shots to give the Blackhawks one more win in an incredible decade.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["blackhawks", ""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Wgn Web Desk"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "CALGARY - Over the past few days, many reflected back on what's been the greatest decade in the history of Blackhawks' hockey.
