the U.S. embassy in Baghdad fired tear gas to disperse Iraqi protesters who gathered at the walls of the compound for a second day to show support for a powerful Iranian-backed Shiite militia.\n\nDozens of protesters and supporters of the Hashd Shaabi militia set up camp outside the gates of the embassy on Wednesday, one day after thousands converged on Baghdad\u2019s heavily fortified Green Zone to decry U.S. strikes that killed at least 25 militiamen on the weekend.\n\nSeveral protesters set fire to the outside wall of the embassy, where heavily armed U.S. forces were seen standing on the roof of the building, witnesses said.\n\nSome protesters suffered breathing problems from the tear gas, the witnesses added.\n\nThe U.S. strikes in Iraq and Syria on Sunday targeted the Kataib Hezbollah militia group, which was blamed for an attack last week that killed a U.S. citizen.\n\nKataib Hezbollah, a part of the Hashd Saabi umbrella group, is independent from the Hezbollah group in Lebanon that is trained and financed by Iran.\n\nChanting \u201cDeath to America,\u201d angry protesters on Tuesday broke into the U.S. embassy compound and set fire to one of its gates.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has blamed the attack on Iran and said the country will \u201cpay a very big price.\u201d\n\nTehran has blasted Washington\u2019s \u201cirrational response\u201d to the protests and denied any involvement.\n\nTrump spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel-Mahdi by phone on Tuesday and \u201cemphasised the need to protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper called on the government of Iraq to \u201cfulfil its international responsibilities\u201d to protect US citizens in the country.\n\nWashington has announced that it will immediately deploy 750 soldiers to Iraq \u201cas an appropriate and precautionary action.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["News Agency Of Nigeria"],
