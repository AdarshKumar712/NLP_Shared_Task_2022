This is bittersweet because our group is growing \u2013 but that means there are more people affected by suicide.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, he hopes to extend coverage of James\u2019 Support Group meetings to Tain, Dingwall and Aviemore with a breakfast club event, aimed at helping men to talk more, to be held at Ross County FC.\n\nA Games, Giggle and Craic evening in Cromarty drew a full house and plans are afoot for a second one.\n\nMr Mullery added: \u201cRoss County FC fans may well have noticed our stand at the car park entrance on many home matches. We will be at most home games to the end of March which sees the end of the peak period for suicides.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Latest News", "Community"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "An Inverness suicide support group plans to expand to meet demand.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01Z14:30:00.0000000+00:00", "tag": "Community"}, "original-source": "https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/news/suicide-support-group-has-been-a-bittersweet-success-188886/", "og": {"url": "https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/news/suicide-support-group-has-been-a-bittersweet-success-188886/", "locale": "en_GB", "description": "An Inverness suicide support group plans to expand to meet demand.", "title": "Suicide support group has been a \u201cbittersweet\u201d success", "type": "article", "site_name": "Inverness Courier", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/_media/img/LDB6KYWO9A95AY1NE13K.jpg", "width": 1572, "height": 1080}}, "description": "An Inverness suicide support group plans to expand to meet demand.", "keywords": "Latest News, Community"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/news/suicide-support-group-has-been-a-bittersweet-success-188886/"}
