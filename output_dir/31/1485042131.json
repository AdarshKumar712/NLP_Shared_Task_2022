I apologise for the bad example given yesterday,\" the head of the Catholic church said before celebrating Mass at the Vatican.\n\nTwitter enthusiasts commented with abandon on the pontiff's prompt riposte to the woman.\n\nFrancis had greeted children before the Nativity scene on Saint Peter's square and was turning away when the woman who had crossed herself then cried out something, pulled on his hand and almost caused him to fall.\n\nThe 83-year-old pope grimaced before managing to break free by slapping her hand twice.\n\nHe continued his tour, walking with some difficulty while maintaining a slightly greater distance from visitors, and gradually relaxed again as he came into contact with other children.\n\nTwitter comments were mostly supportive of the pontiff's instinctive reaction.\n\n\"HE IS HUMAN.. Been (sic) a Pope doesn't make you immune to Pain or avoid Reaction to pain,\" one typical comment read.\n\nIn his first Mass of the New Year, the pontiff later denounced \"all violence against women\" as \"a profanation of God, born of a woman.\"\n\nFrancis also said women were \"the source of life\" but deplored that they were constantly \"offended, beaten, abused and forced into prostitution\" and forced to \"supress the life they carry within\" them.\n\nHe emphasised that the \"rebirth of humanity began with a woman,\" and bemoaned that women's bodies were \"sacrificed on the profane altars of advertising, profit, pornography.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 11:56:01 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Pope Francis apologised Wednesday for his widely-viewed slap of a woman who had grabbed his hand as he greeted Catholic faithful on New Year's Eve.
