Knowing that you were supposed to have a good new year and then something like this happens without expecting it? No one could've imagined it,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to police, Juana fled the scene shortly after. Juana was charged with first-degree murder and tampering with evidence.\n\nNo arrests have been made yet. This is Roswell\u2019s ninth homicide of 2019 within city limits.\n\nAnyone with information about Juana\u2019s whereabouts is asked to call the Roswell Police Department at (575) 624-6770.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "\"We were fine.
