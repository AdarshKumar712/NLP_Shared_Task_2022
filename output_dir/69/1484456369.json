When the bag is upright, the legs retract and lay snug against the bag.\n\nGolfers prefer stand bags when they are walking on the course. That's because the retractable legs allow the bag to remain upright on turf, whereas cart or staff bags are designed to be used on flat surfaces, such as the back of a riding cart. But if you walk the course, there's no need for your clubs to stay on the cart path when you're teeing off or lining up a putt.\n\nMany stand bags come equipped with backpack-style shoulder straps that distribute the weight across both shoulders. Stand bags weigh about 5 pounds or lighter. Some even have additional ergonomic features, such as a hip pad to prevent the bag from rubbing you the wrong way as you walk.\n\nIt also should be noted that stand bags can be used with push/pull carts or strapped to the back of a riding cart. But you should take particular care when doing so, especially with push or pull carts, to make sure the legs don't get damaged in trying to secure it with straps.\n\nThe global Golf Stand Bag market is valued at xx million US$ in 2018 and will reach xx million US$ by the end of 2025, growing at a CAGR of xx% during 2020-2025.
