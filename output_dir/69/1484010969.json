And while limited special pricing was $170 for ladies and $190 for men, regular prices have reached $200 for women and $220 for gents.\n\nFinancial consultant and economist Jeremy Stephen told Barbados TODAY the New Year\u2019s Eve celebration was simply one of those things people would spend on even if they were concerned about low income throughout the year.\n\nHe explained that while people would be more \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d towards some products or services at other times of the year, they tend to spend on special occasions.\n\n\u201cThey obviously chose what is cheaper while sacrificing quality in the short-term, with hopes that income will rise in time, but when it comes to items like New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations, there are some factors that fall into place that are interesting,\u201d said Stephen.\n\n\u201cPrice no longer really is the determinant, but rather the fact that you are shopping an exclusive type of event \u2013 something that is supposed to be once in a blue moon, something that is supposed to give certain glitz and glamour,\u201d he added.\n\nIn giving a short analysis of the kind of spending expected for the one night of celebration, Stephen further explained: \u201cIt is all about the emotional ties or feelings that you get with a New Year\u2019s Day celebrations. That is what they are thinking about and that is what people pay for.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, they react more so to the crowd that they are going to be with and less so to the price.\u201d\n\nSome of the more affordable celebrations will take place at various clubs and bars.\n\nThe Truth Lounge in Maxwell is promising live performances with a general admission cost of $35, while UWI, BCC & Ross University students will pay $25 with identification.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dukes Night Lounge in Holetown will be hosting its \u201cdrinks free\u201d New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations for general admission of $80.\n\nWith several people reporting that they will be going out for an Old Year\u2019s Night dinner, several establishments have also been advertising specials.\n\nThe 6 Mix Bar on the south coast, will be offering an open kitchen, live deejay and free champagne party, for a price of $100 per person or $180 per couple, that will include house drinks and party favours.\n\nMeanwhile, the Horny Ram Pub, in Trents, St James will be serving up a three-course menu with complimentary drinks and a live deejay, for a cost of $275 per person.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Marlon Madden"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Many Barbadians will once again be forking out hundreds, and possibly thousands, of dollars to attend\u00a0New Year\u2019s Eve\u00a0celebrations to ring in 2020, as they put aside any economic concerns they may have had throughout the year.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cropped-logo-150x150.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1386333611", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.luovalabs.barbadostodaymobile", "google-site-verification": "tv6HaZJva6u6f8lwfpLqmQ5hBqYUg7fqvhonjYsxXzo", "description": "Many Barbadians will once again be forking out hundreds, and possibly thousands, of dollars to attend\u00a0New Year\u2019s Eve\u00a0celebrations to ring in 2020, as they put aside any economic concerns they may have had throughout the year.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "No cost too high . . .
