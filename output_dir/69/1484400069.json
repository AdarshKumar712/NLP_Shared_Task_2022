The second hottest year was 2013, followed by 2005, 2018 and 2017.\n\nThe data, from the bureau\u2019s long-term ACORN-SAT data, will be used as part of the bureau\u2019s annual climate statement due for release on 9 January.\n\nProf Mark Howden, the director of the ANU Climate Change Institute, said the continued rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, caused mainly by burning fossil fuels, was the underlying driver of the heat.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that greenhouse gas emissions are changing the radiation balance of the Earth. Other contributors are minor in comparison.\u201d\n\nHe said two other climate systems had also played a role in delivering the record hot year.\n\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole system had drawn moisture away from the centre of the continent, causing extra heat to build there. Another system known as the Southern Annular Mode had also contributed to the heat.\n\nData from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology shows 2019 was the hottest year on record. Data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology shows 2019 was the hottest year on record.\n\nThe data also shows that 2019 was the hottest year on record for New South Wales, with temperatures 1.95C above the long-term average, beating the previous record year, 2018, by 0.27C.\n\nWestern Australia also had its hottest year, with temperatures 1.67C above average, beating the previous 2013 heat record by 0.58C.\n\nThe Northern Territory and South Australia both had their second hottest years, with 2019 coming in fifth hottest for Victoria and sixth hottest for Queensland, according to the data. Tasmania had a relatively cool year, but was still 0.41C above the long-term average.\n\nThe previous summer of 2018-19 was the hottest on record. The spring of 2019 also delivered the worst bushfire weather since at least 1950, when the Forest Fire Danger Index data began.\n\nOn Wednesday 18 December, Australia experienced its hottest day on record with an average maximum temperature of 41.9C (107.4F), beating the previous record by 1C that had been set only 24 hours earlier.\n\nDr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales specialising in extreme events, said 2019 had started hot, with the previous summer being the hottest on record.\n\nClimate patterns behind Australia's bushfires, heat and drought set to improve Read more\n\nShe said: \u201cThe extremes have been seen in lots of heatwaves and, of course, the bushfires, that are a consequence of the very hot and dry conditions.\u201d\n\nShe said while natural climate cycles had pushed temperatures higher, \u201cclimate change has given them a boost\u201d.\n\n\u201c2019 would not have been pleasant anyway, but climate change has made it worse. We are focusing now on the bushfires, but the underlying heat has been driving these conditions for much of the year.\n\n\u201cClimate change isn\u2019t the outright cause, but it\u2019s an undeniable contributor to this extreme year on all accounts.\u201d\n\nA bureau spokesperson said it would provide official comment on the 2019 temperatures in its annual climate statement on January 9 that would include a \u201ccomprehensive analysis of the year\u2019s weather events and climate context, including any records of note\u201d.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Australia weather", "Drought", "Bushfires", "Australia news", "Climate change", "Environment", "Natural disasters and extreme weather"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Graham Readfearn"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Bureau of Meteorology data shows average temperature record across the country beat previous high of 2013", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/fee5e2d638d1c35f6d501fa397e53329/152x152.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Bureau of Meteorology data shows average temperature record across the country beat previous high of 2013", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Graham Readfearn", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91ae83450cf3e6634e2be4bc0fb3e2b071546ba1/0_120_3588_2153/master/3588.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e9fa0c7a7d789d7b5554e058a2ffd459", "keywords": "Australia weather,Drought,Bushfires,Australia news,Climate change,Environment,Natural disasters and extreme weather", "news_keywords": "Australia weather,Drought,Bushfires,Australia news,Climate change,Environment,Natural disasters and extreme weather", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/02/2019-australia-hottest-year-record-temperature-15c-above-average-temperature", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91ae83450cf3e6634e2be4bc0fb3e2b071546ba1/0_120_3588_2153/master/3588.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=429ba73dae43c503fba06400288500f2", "description": "Bureau of Meteorology data shows average temperature record across the country beat previous high of 2013", "type": "article", "title": "2019 was Australia's hottest year on record \u2013 1.5C above average temperature", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/graham-readfearn", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Australia news", "published_time": "2020-01-02T01:17:26.000Z", "tag": "Australia weather,Drought,Bushfires,Australia news,Climate change,Environment,Natural disasters and extreme weather", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T01:45:38.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://australia-news/2020/jan/02/2019-australia-hottest-year-record-temperature-15c-above-average-temperature?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://australia-news/2020/jan/02/2019-australia-hottest-year-record-temperature-15c-above-average-temperature?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/02/2019-australia-hottest-year-record-temperature-15c-above-average-temperature", "iphone": "gnmguardian://australia-news/2020/jan/02/2019-australia-hottest-year-record-temperature-15c-above-average-temperature?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91ae83450cf3e6634e2be4bc0fb3e2b071546ba1/0_120_3588_2153/master/3588.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=9fa63c67fedbc589caf0c46a68a20a83", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@readfearn", "dnt": "on"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/02/2019-australia-hottest-year-record-temperature-15c-above-average-temperature"}
