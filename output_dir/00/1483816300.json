Everyone has the right to say that any law is wrong. Since the state felt that this (CAA) is unconstitutional, the Assembly urged the Centre to back it back since it can not strike the law down,\" he told ANI.\n\nHe said that the Assembly resolution was not against the law. \"The Assembly has not taken any unlawful step. They (the Centre) are attacking the Constitution which can not be allowed,\" Karat said.\n\nThe Kerala Assembly passed the resolution seeking withdrawal of the Citizenship Amendment Act on Tuesday.\n\nIrked over the development, BJP MP and spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao demanded Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's resignation, saying he does not have trust in the Constitution.\n\n\"CAA is a central law passed by both Houses of Parliament. If you are passing a resolution against it that means you are making a mockery of the Indian Constitution. In this case, Pinarayi Vijayan should resign from the (state) government and say I don't have trust in the Constitution,\" Rao said.\n\nReacting to the opposition to the resolution, Vijayan on Wednesday said: \"The resolution passed by Kerala (Assembly) is against the unconstitutional Act passed by the Centre. It has been noticed by the whole country.\"\n\nHe said that any challenges arising out of the move will be \"faced together by Kerala\".\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Politics of India", "Left-wing politics", "Malayali people", "Prakash Karat", "Communist Party of India", "Political parties by country", "Kerala Legislative Assembly", "spokesperson", "Pinarayi Vijayan", "Central government", "Chief Minister", "Kerala Assembly", "GVL Narasimha"], "tags": ["Law Crime"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Read more about Kerala Assembly's anti-CAA resolution a request to Centre: Prakash Karat on BJP's objection on Business Standard.
