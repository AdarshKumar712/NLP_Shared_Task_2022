No such thing. Western journalists and opinion leaders are in no mood for peace and reconciliation. It wasn\u2019t the Steinmeyer Formula or the Minsk Agreement that kept coming up at the recent hearings on Capitol Hill, but rather the Javelin missiles, of course. The main concern in the West was that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky might appear weak in the 9 December meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia or even could \u201ccapitulate\u201d completely.\n\nIn that respect, the Western media seemed to be channeling the zeitgeist from Kyiv, where crowds were apparently on call, lest the comedian turned president of Ukraine not show adequate spine. Led by the defeated incumbent Petro Poroshenko, protesters were perhaps poised for Maidan 2.0 if that proved necessary. Fortunately, it did not, and all the journalists could go back to writing about various conspiracies, whether Rudolph Guliani\u2019s most recent visit to Kyiv or the latest murder spectacle. Peace negotiations \u2013 what a quaint and silly idea. Why even bother?\n\nMeasured as a meeting that aired grievances candidly and got both sides rather red in the face, the Paris Summit in the Normandy format (with Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany all represented) seems to have succeeded. A writer in the Kyiv Post channeled a rather smug \u201ctold you so\u201d attitude immediately after this first Zelensky-Putin encounter, explaining that the possibility of genuine peace in the Donbass is simply up to the Russian president, \u201cBut it appears that he does not want to\u201d make peace. The author explains: \u201cZelensky returned to Kyiv with what many saw as no victory and no loss, \u2018a draw\u2019 \u2026 The reaction in Ukraine seems to be that the political newcomer, president since May, did what he could \u2014 neither capitulating nor delivering a breakthrough.\u201d This Ukrainian reporter does admit that the prisoner swaps, along with the pull back of troops from the front line, as well as the new crossing points for civilians do amount to something achieved. But the article also notes that sparks flew aplenty over the issue of Ukrainian control of the border between Donbass and Russia, and concludes by quoting a Brussels specialist, who observes that Putin\u2019s goal is \u201cis to keep Ukraine in trouble and himself in power.\u201d\n\nThe single substantial analysis to run in the New York Times after the summit did not highlight any of the progress outlined above, but predictably focused on the negative. There were the usual tropes about \u201cappeasement,\u201d of course. The Russian president is said by these DC establishment \u201cexperts\u201d to require a war to keep himself in power, and that the Kremlin will \u201cnever abide a stable, prosperous \u2026 Ukraine.\u201d These authors bemoan increasing \u201cUkraine fatigue\u201d in the West, as if only more military aid for Kyiv will bring about peace. Most galling is the critique of the actual peacemakers: both French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel, who are derided as arrogant and also na\u00efve for striving to end the war. This follows an infuriating pattern of Americans pretending that they understand European security better than do Europeans themselves. With irretrievably hawkish establishment foreign policy views like these predominating in DC and flourishing in the American press, no wonder U.S.-European relations are in a deep crisis.\n\nAnd that hostile feeling is generally reciprocated in Moscow, logically enough. One Russian perspective on the discordant meeting in Paris was that the war will be dramatically intensified by the United States and its allies, which are said to be intending to declare the Donbass \u201cmilitias to be \u2018terrorist groups\u2019 and our country their \u2018sponsor\u2019 [\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a \u2018\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438,\u2019 \u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0443 \u2013 \u0438\u0445 \u2018\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c\u2019], concluding that the Donbass militias will then be \u201cdestroyed.\u201d Another Russian article appearing after the summit said that Kyiv is preparing to resolve the Donbass issue by force, so \u201cDonbass veterans are ready to fight back against NATO \u2018peacekeepers.\u2019 [\u0412\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044b \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0431\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044b \u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442\u043f\u043e\u0440 \u2018\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0430\u043c\u2019 \u041d\u0410\u0422\u041e].\u201d A slightly less hawkish appraisal appeared under the headline \u201cThe War in Donbass is not stopped,\u201d wherein the author asks incredulously \u201cWhat can be achieved in a situation, when Kyiv is basically not ready to make compromises [\u0427\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0442\u044c \u2026 \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043f\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043a \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043c]?\u201d A common theme, echoing Putin\u2019s agitated responses, was the frustration that Zelensky was walking back the progress from previous rounds of negotiations, known as the Minsk Accords. Interestingly, and quite contrary to conventional Western assessment of the Russian press as state-controlled, one Russian headline appeared that excoriated Putin for his supposedly \u201cquiet capitulation,\u201d before the Ukrainians.
