Al Green: The \u2018genesis\u2019 of Trump\u2019s impeachment began when he was \u2018running for office\u2019\n\nOne of the most vocal pro-impeachment Democratic voices on Capitol Hill said the \u201cgenesis\u201d of President Trump\u2019s impeachment began long before the Ukraine scandal.\n\nRep. Al Green, D-Texas, one of the first lawmakers to push for Trump\u2019s impeachment, appeared on MSNBC on Monday and was confronted about the president, and how his allies have weaponized Green\u2019s outspokenness against Democrats.\n\n\u201cPolitical expediency and insincerity \u2014 those are two charges that have been leveled against Democrats during this entire affair, particularly since September when the formal impeachment inquiry started, and you play a starring role in those charges,\u201d MSNBC host Chris Hayes said to Green.\n\n\u201cThe argument goes like this of House Republicans and Trump and his allies: the Democrats wanted to impeach Donald Trump from day one, they cast about looking for a set of facts that they could plausibly use to do it, and all of it was pretextual and reverse-engineered to get to this point, and Exhibit One: Congressman Al Green, who [has] been calling for the man\u2019s impeachment for two years now,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your response to that charge?\u201d\n\nGreen didn\u2019t deny the charge being made against him.\n\n\u201cWell, the genesis of impeachment, to be very candid with you, was when the president was running for office and he had members of his own party to talk about his unfitness to hold office,\u201d Green told Hayes, later citing rhetoric from Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah; Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., from the 2016 election. \u201cSo the president didn\u2019t have the luxury of persons from his party having been on his side as it were throughout this entire ordeal.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thepiratescove.us/wp-content/themes/violator-11/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.5", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Rep Al Green Admits Impeachment Was Always The Democrat Goal", "url": "https://www.thepiratescove.us/2020/01/01/rep-al-green-admits-impeachment-was-always-the-democrat-goal/", "description": "The impeachment theater of the Democrats was always political, it was always unhinged, and it began even before Trump was elected Rep.
