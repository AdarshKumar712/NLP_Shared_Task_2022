Peter King for supporting Rep. Tom Suozzi\u2019s bill that would raise the deduction cap for state and local property taxes from $10,000 to $20,000 [\u201cHouse passes bill to ease deduction cap,\u201d News, Dec. 20].\n\nKing\u2019s comments expressing disappointment with Republican colleagues who voted against the measure rang particularly true. In noting their lack of support despite the fact that high-tax regions like Nassau and Suffolk counties get back less than they contribute to the federal government and thereby subsidized their states for the past 50 years, King said they were undermining the middle class.\n\nSadly, my congressman, Lee Zeldin, voted against the bill because of the provision that would raise the top tax rate for individuals earning more than $518,400 from 37% to back to 39.6%. He justified his vote by saying he didn\u2019t want raise taxes on individuals and small businesses. I don\u2019t think I have friends or neighbors who earn more than $518,400 per year, and if I did, I don\u2019t think that adding 2.6% to their tax bill would have a devastating impact on them or the economy. In casting his vote against the bill, Zeldin turned his back to the majority of the people he represents. Shame on him.\n\nEd Swensson,\n\nLake Grove\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a far-right conservative to believe that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the State Legislature share in the blame for our high taxes and the SALT cap [\u201cLong Island needs SALT cap relief,\u201d Editorial, Dec., 23].\n\nThe governor has projected a $6 billion deficit and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie\u2019s solution is more taxes, not a reduction in spending. As long as New York continues to tax and spend without restraint, don\u2019t expect sympathy from Congress with regard to SALT.\n\nHoward Lindenauer,\n\nSign up for The Point Go inside New York politics.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez teamed up with others to block Amazon\u2019s plan in Long Island City, many of us were upset that as many as 40,000 jobs would not come to New York City, and that needed transit improvements in the area would still not be funded. We understood why she doesn\u2019t like Amazon \u2014 but strongly disagreed with her crass actions.\n\nIf, at the time, some of us thought she disliked the middle class, we really didn\u2019t say much. But knowing that she voted to maintain President Donald Trump\u2019s huge tax increase on the middle class in states like New York, it\u2019s become clear that she has declared war on the middle class. She says she voted against the SALT bill to not help the rich. Most New Yorkers hurt by this tax increase are not rich. We don\u2019t have huge houses or high income. For my family, the 2018 tax effect was to have us pay several thousand dollars more in taxes \u2014 money we couldn\u2019t afford to lose. And now she has done her worst to hurt us.\n\nRon Troy,\n\nEast Northport", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Newsday Readers"], "publish_date": "Mon Dec 30 10:30:44 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Although he doesn\u2019t represent my district, I\u2019d like to thank Rep.
