Regardless of what side of the political aisle you find yourself, respect should always be given to all elected officials and confirmed jurists, regardless of how they voted or ruled.\n\nOne Emory University and Old Navy alum, Duy Nyugen, went as far as to say that Scalia didn\u2019t deserve the honor and respect he is given after his death because according to Nyugen, he \u201cdidn\u2019t earn it while living.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Scalia didn\u2019t want people to trash his memory, maybe he should have tried harder at not being a dick,\u201d added Nyugen\n\nHmm? I am not sure why \u201cLittle Duy\u201d would post something so vulgar or offensive, but maybe he is deflected away from a \u201cshortcoming\u201d he may have?\n\nEnter more frustrated kids.\n\nNicholas Van Erp, Brad Storch, Connor Peth, and others, decided to turn to the same toilet bowl they appear to think from.\n\nLet\u2019s just remember that in 1986, Judge Antonin Scalia was confirmed by the U.S. Senate 98-0. That\u2019s 98-0.\n\nAnd you know what, current 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden was part of the Senate Democratic Caucus who voted that day. Ouch!\n\nBiden once said that Justice Scalia was \u201cone of our most influential justices.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Javier Manjarres Is A Nationally Renowned Award-Winning South Florida-Based Political Journalist Owns Diverse New Media", "Corp.
