(Glenn Puit/Las Vegas Review-Journal)\n\nA report of shots fired prompted an extensive police response to an apartment complex in northwest Las Vegas early Wednesday, with police eventually learning a man was hospitalized because of an assault during a New Year\u2019s party.\n\nLas Vegas police Lt. David Gordon said police were called at 5:30 a.m. to Atlas Apartment Homes at 5067 Madre Mesa Dr., off North Decatur Boulevard, for a report of shots fired.\n\n\u201cWhen officers arrived several people with various family relations told a convoluted story, with some hearing gunshots,\u201d Gordon said.\n\nPolice were later told a male victim was possibly run over by a vehicle. One man was rushed to the hospital with serious injuries to his face.\n\nA preliminary investigation, however, indicates the man was assaulted during a party, but there were no shots fired. The victim was at University Medical Center with injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nContact Glenn Puit at gpuit@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0390.
