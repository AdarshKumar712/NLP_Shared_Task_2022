These policies include labeling a number of Palestinian political and resistance factions, such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Al-Aqsa-Brigade-Fatah, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Popular Front \u2013 General Command as terrorist groups and organizations. In addition, the policies require Palestinian civil society to play the role of security accomplice against its people through the so-called procedures of \u201cvetting\u201d and \u201cscreening\u201d.*\n\nDirector of the Badil Center, Nidal Al-Azzeh, told PNN that institutions of all kinds refuse to sign the annexes sent by the European Union, which include new conditions placed on the funding provided by the union.\n\nNidal stressed Badil\u2019s rejection of the annex contents, which classifies five Palestinian political forces as \u201cterrorist organizations\u201dadding that center received funding for a project with a value of one million two hundred thousand dollars which they withdrew for their refusal to sign the conditional papers, saying they affected the Palestinian history, cause and resistance of the people.\n\nAl-Azzeh indicated that the organization went to the PLO and the Palestinian Authority, and demanded that they issue a position to prevent Palestinian institutions from signing and accepting this statement.\n\nHe also called on the Palestinian street to be part of this opinion that affects the Palestinian national fabric.\n\nPalestinian institutions called on the European Union and donor institutions to abolish this condition from any contracts with Palestinian civil society institutions.\n\nIn a statement, Badil called on Palestinian civil society organizations to abstain from signing any conditional funding agreement that includes the anti-terrorism policies, and institutions that have signed such contracts, to terminate such agreements immediately. It also called upon international civil society, especially those movements and organizations in solidarity with the Palestinian people and their rights, to condemn the conditional financing policy and pressure the European Union and its donor institutions to abolish this unjust condition.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Dec 30 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://english.pnn.ps/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Al-Azzeh: Civil society institutions reject conditioned funding by EU - PNN", "type": "article", "description": "PNN/ Bethlehem/ Palestinian civil society organizations announced their absolute rejection of politi", "url": "http://english.pnn.ps/2019/12/30/al-azzeh-civil-society-institutions-reject-conditioned-funding-by-eu/", "site_name": "PNN", "image": "http://english.pnn.ps/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/\u0642\u0645\u0629-\u0623\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0629-\u0637\u0627\u0631\u0626\u0629-\u0641\u064a-\u0628\u0631\u0648\u0643\u0633\u0644-\u0644\u0628\u062d\u062b-\u062a\u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0627\u062a-\u062e\u0631\u0648\u062c-\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627-\u0645\u0646-\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\u062d\u0627\u062f-\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0628\u064a-660x330-1.jpg"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 1.0.2", "viewport": "width=1045"}, "canonical_link": "http://english.pnn.ps/2019/12/30/al-azzeh-civil-society-institutions-reject-conditioned-funding-by-eu/"}
