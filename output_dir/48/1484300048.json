Read More\n\nSECUNDERABAD: The second largest cantonment of the country, Secunderabad , was ranked as the worst performer among all 62 cantonment boards surveyed in the Centre\u2019s Swachh Survekshan League 2020 (SS League 2020) rankings.The ministry of housing and urban affairs released results of the last two quarters beginning April in New Delhi.The SS League 2020, which monitors cleanliness in cities/cantonment boards, allotted 2,000 marks for each quarter. According to the results, the Secunderabad Cantonment Board ( SCB ) secured 136.83 marks in the first quarter and 10.61 marks in the second quarter, thereby ending in the last spot in both quarters.With 1187.39 marks, the St. Thomas Mount cantonment in Tamil Nadu secured the first spot in the first quarter and Delhi cantonment stood at the top by securing 1368.55 marks in the second quarter. The evaluation was done based on services provided, observation and citizen feedback through outbound phone calls.With a 42-square kilometre area and population of nearly four lakh residents, the SCB is the second largest cantonment in the country. However, it failed to compete with other cantonments which are significantly smaller with predominant army presence.Dehu road in Pune, Nainital, Wellington, Shimla are among those who have emerged among the top 20 cantonments in the country in the SS League 2020.Residents claim that the SCB\u2019s ranking has been affected due to its failure in collecting garbage, not providing adequate public toilets and poor solid waste management.\u201cEven today, many colonies in SCB wards don\u2019t have public bins, forcing people to throw garbage on roads. This garbage is often not picked up by the SCB cleaners. Apart from this, there are insufficient public toilets,\u201d said Sudha Konidela, a resident of Vasavi Nagar Colony.Residents blamed SCB for not making enough efforts in taking up developmental works in the areas under its limits. \u201cFor years, the SCB has been crying over shortage of funds. Basic issues related to road repair, water and cleanliness have not been addressed due to shortage of funds. The rankings look poorly on the cantonment,\u201d said Jeetendra Surana, secretary of All Cantonments Citizens Welfare Association.Admitting its inability to perform well in the rankings, the SCB authorities passed the buck to the Centre over its failure in clearing dues. \u201cSince we are yet to receive Rs 550 crore from the Centre, we are unable to meet even basic needs of the residents. We are unable to pay our contractors, sweepers. Therefore, we are falling back in terms of cleanliness,\u201d said J Ramakrishna, SCB vice-president.Ramakrishna said paucity of funds forced the board to seek help. \u201cSo far, we were self-sustaining. However, for the first time in the history, we were forced to go for aided board as the gap between residents\u2019 needs and availability of funds is only increasing by the day. The Centre should distribute funds proportionately to enable us to perform our basic civic activities,\u201d said Ramakrishna.The performance of cities in SS League 2020 is crucial to their ranking in Swachh Survekshan 2020 due to the 25% weightage of the quarterly assessment to be included in the annual survey scheduled to commence from January 4 till January 31, 2020.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Hyderabad news", "Hyderabad latest news", "Hyderabad news live", "Hyderabad news today", "Today news Hyderabad", "Secunderabad news", "Secunderabad Cantonment Board", "secunderabad", "scb", "Hyderabad news"], "tags": ["Delhi Earthquake", "Chennai Rains", "K Chandrasekhar Rao", "Hyderabad Metro", "Bangalore Rains", "Mumbai Rains", "Mumbai Floods", "GHMC", "Asaduddin owaisi", "Delhi Pollution", "KT Rama Rao"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The second largest cantonment of the country, Secunderabad, was ranked as the worst performer among all 62 cantonment boards surveyed in the Centre\u2019s", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The second largest cantonment of the country, Secunderabad, was ranked as the worst performer among all 62 cantonment boards surveyed in the Centre\u2019s", "keywords": "Hyderabad news, Hyderabad latest news, Hyderabad news live, Hyderabad news today, Today news Hyderabad,Secunderabad news,Secunderabad Cantonment Board,secunderabad,scb,Hyderabad news", "og": {"title": "Clean-up time: Secunderabad Cantonment Board hits bottom in Swachh League 2020 ranking | Hyderabad News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/clean-up-time-scb-hits-bottom-in-swachh-league-2020-ranking/articleshow/73062549.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063367,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-262894,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "The second largest cantonment of the country, Secunderabad, was ranked as the worst performer among all 62 cantonment boards surveyed in the Centre\u2019s", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/clean-up-time-scb-hits-bottom-in-swachh-league-2020-ranking/articleshow/73062549.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063367,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-262894,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "Clean-up time: Secunderabad Cantonment Board hits bottom in Swachh League 2020 ranking | Hyderabad News - Times of India", "description": "The second largest cantonment of the country, Secunderabad, was ranked as the worst performer among all 62 cantonment boards surveyed in the Centre\u2019s", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/clean-up-time-scb-hits-bottom-in-swachh-league-2020-ranking/articleshow/73062549.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 26781952138, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0", "robots": "NOODP"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/clean-up-time-scb-hits-bottom-in-swachh-league-2020-ranking/articleshow/73062549.cms"}
