Filmmakers Benny and Josh Safdie have infused Uncut Gems with an impressively stylish sensibility that\u2019s reflected in its myriad of attributes, with, especially, Daniel Lopatin\u2019s ominous score and Darius Khondji\u2019s lush, captivating visuals effectively perpetuating the Safdies\u2019 visceral sensibilities. And although the picture boasts an absolutely spellbinding turn from Sandler, with the actor delivering an impressively transformative performance, Uncut Gems\u2018 episodic structure paves the way for an exceedingly erratic midsection that\u2019s rarely as engrossing and tense as one might\u2019ve anticipated \u2013 with the film\u2019s arms-length atmosphere compounded by the protagonist\u2019s somewhat inexplicable behavior (ie why doesn\u2019t he just stop?) The ongoing inclusion of admittedly absorbing sequences (eg Howard attempts to repair a security door in his shop) proves effective at buoying one\u2019s interest on a fairly regular basis, at least, and yet Uncut Gems\u2018 lack of connective tissue ensures that the whole thing hardly concludes on the taut note that the Safdies have clearly intended \u2013 which is a shame, certainly, given that the movie does boast a whole handful of better-than-average elements. (Sandler is indeed just that good here, despite the always-distracting fake teeth.)\n\n** out of ****", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Adam Sandler", "Benny and Josh Safdie"], "authors": ["David Nusair"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 5.0.8"}, "canonical_link": "https://reelfilm.com/uncut-gems/"}
