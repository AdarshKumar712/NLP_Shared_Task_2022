On the debate stage in December the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren attacked the mayor regarding fundraisers including a now infamous occasion in a Napa Valley wine cave.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s time as mayor of a small city in northern Indiana ended on New Years\u2019 Day, leaving him free to concentrate on a Democratic primary in which he has surged from unknown to top-tier contender.\n\nHe leads polling averages in Iowa, the first state to vote, and is second in New Hampshire, the next target in the race for the nomination to face Donald Trump in November.\n\nHowever, the realclearpolitics.com national polling average for the Democratic field, which is still an unwieldy 15 candidates strong, puts Buttigieg 20 points behind the frontrunner, former vice-president Joe Biden.\n\nThe Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, second nationally, 10 points adrift of Biden, had the largest fundraising haul in the third quarter, raising $25.2m.\n\nWarren \u2013 third nationally, seven points up on Buttigieg \u2013 has both said she will not hold any fundraisers and accused the mayor of being influenced by big donors.\n\n\u201cWhen a candidate brags about how beholden he feels to a group of wealthy investors,\u201d she said in a December speech, \u201cour democracy is in serious trouble.\u201d\n\nThe Pete Buttigieg pile-on revealed: he is no political messiah | Richard Wolffe Read more\n\nSanders has also attacked. Last month, the senator told the Guardian support Buttigieg was receiving from billionaires was \u201cexactly the problem with American politics\u201d.\n\nButtigieg has opened fundraisers to the press and disclosed the identities of top donors. But he has also insisted Democrats need to fundraise from anyone, so they can remain competitive against Trump, who has amassed a formidable war chest.\n\nOn Tuesday, Buttigieg closed out 2019 with a series of appeals for donations. On Twitter, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve taken our message about the purpose of the presidency and the possibilities for our politics from obscurity to the top tier of our country\u2019s political process.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of work ahead of us. But unlike a year ago, we\u2019ll do it with strong, national grassroots support.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Pete Buttigieg", "Indiana", "US politics", "US elections 2020", "US news"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Buttigieg\u2019s successful fundraising efforts have drawn criticism from Democratic 2020 candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/fee5e2d638d1c35f6d501fa397e53329/152x152.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Buttigieg\u2019s successful fundraising efforts have drawn criticism from Democratic 2020 candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Martin Pengelly", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0383e77fafd542e0155cdccb531bdfd6ae3f77f8/0_125_2966_1781/master/2966.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3e528a288413bfc162072464cb9a623a", "keywords": "Pete Buttigieg,Indiana,US politics,US elections 2020,US news", "news_keywords": "Pete Buttigieg,Indiana,US politics,US elections 2020,US news", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/01/pete-buttigieg-campaign-raised-247m-in-fourth-quarter", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0383e77fafd542e0155cdccb531bdfd6ae3f77f8/0_125_2966_1781/master/2966.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=610f742d545a662509c8c38bdf1b28d1", "description": "Buttigieg\u2019s successful fundraising efforts have drawn criticism from Democratic 2020 candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders", "type": "article", "title": "Pete Buttigieg campaign raised $24.7m in fourth quarter", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-pengelly", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "US news", "published_time": "2020-01-01T16:10:08.000Z", "tag": "Pete Buttigieg,Indiana,US politics,US elections 2020,US news", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T16:10:09.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2020/jan/01/pete-buttigieg-campaign-raised-247m-in-fourth-quarter?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2020/jan/01/pete-buttigieg-campaign-raised-247m-in-fourth-quarter?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/01/pete-buttigieg-campaign-raised-247m-in-fourth-quarter", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2020/jan/01/pete-buttigieg-campaign-raised-247m-in-fourth-quarter?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0383e77fafd542e0155cdccb531bdfd6ae3f77f8/0_125_2966_1781/master/2966.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=a052add5dd577351fe5752d0c9b5e9fd", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@MartinPengelly", "dnt": "on"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/01/pete-buttigieg-campaign-raised-247m-in-fourth-quarter"}
