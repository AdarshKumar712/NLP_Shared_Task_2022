We\u2019ve worked hard to get to\n\nwhere we are now and we will continue to unleash the greatest racing spectacle on the planet through everything we do.\n\n1950-2020 \u2013 Formula 1\u00ae presents a new logo to celebrate 70 years of the greatest\n\nracing spectacle on the planet Date 1 January 2020 We will celebrate this achievement in lots of ways throughout 2020 and the new logo is just the start of these celebrations.\n\nA lot has happened over the 70 years. 33 drivers have been world champion, 108 have won Grands Prix, while to date, 764 drivers and over 150 teams have taken part. All these achievements have required a stage and a setting in the form of a race track, the ever present arena where teams and drivers can go head to head in the championship battle.\n\nThe two lines in the new logo and interlinked design allow this mark to honour those tracks. Another aim of this design is to allow broadcasters, promoters, sponsors and teams to inject their own colours into the mark providing a level of personalisation in celebrating the anniversary across Formula 1. In addition to the numeric mark, we\u2019ve also designed a word one as shown below.\n\nOur past fuels our future and the new logo celebrates a milestone while also looking ahead. Celebrating 70 years is about making the past part of the present, while our sport looks to the future, which it does with confidence and pride.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["FORMULA 1", "motorsport", "FIA Formula One World Championship"], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 06:47:34 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-Biz-Icon-01-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "http://www.bizbahrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/F1-logo.jpg", "width": 741, "height": 486}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "1950-2020 - Formula 1\u00ae presents a new logo to celebrate 70 years of the greatest racing spectacle on the planet - bizbahrain", "description": "Today marks the start of a special year for Formula 1. 2020 is the seventieth anniversary of the FIA Formula\u00a0One World Championship\u2122, the competition that represents the pinnacle of motorsport and we wanted to\u00a0celebrate it with a special logo, unveiled today and which from 6th January will be visible on all Formula 1\u2019s\u00a0digital platforms.
