capitals for spectacular fireworks displays that lit up the skies over landmarks like Big Ben in London, the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the Parthenon in Athens and the Kremlin in Moscow.\n\nIn Australia, a million revellers thronged Sydney harbour and nearby districts to watch more than 100,000 fireworks explode above the city, even as thousands of people along the country\u2019s eastern seaboard sought refuge from the bushfires on beaches.\n\nThousands in Hong Kong welcomed 2020 on neon-lit promenades in the picturesque Victoria Harbour, breaking into pro-democracy chants shortly after the countdown to midnight.\n\nHong Kong authorities cancelled the main midnight fireworks display for the first time in a decade, citing security concerns. A \u201cSymphony of Lights\u201d took place instead, involving projections on the city\u2019s tallest skyscrapers, while smaller-scale pyrotechnics were launched from waterfront rooftops.\n\nIn Japan, people took turns striking Buddhist temple bells, in accordance with tradition.\n\nSydney decided to press ahead with its fireworks despite calls by some members of the public for the display to be cancelled in solidarity with fire-hit areas in New South Wales, of which the city is the capital.\n\nSydney Mayor Clover Moore said planning had begun 15 months ago and that the event also gave a boost to the economy.\n\nSome towns in eastern Australia cancelled their New Year\u2019s celebrations as naval vessels and military helicopters helped firefighters rescue people fleeing the fires, which have turned swathes of New South Wales into a raging furnace.\n\nThe fires have killed at least 11 people since October, two of them overnight into Tuesday, destroyed more than 4 million hectares (10 million acres) and left many towns and rural areas without electricity or mobile coverage.\n\nElsewhere, revellers from Auckland, New Zealand, to Pyongyang, the capital of isolated North Korea, welcomed the new year with fireworks displays.\n\nBut amid the celebrations of a new year and decade, old tensions threatened to flare up. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Wednesday his country would keep developing nuclear programmes and introduce a \u201cnew strategic weapon\u201d in the near future, after the United States missed a year-end deadline to restart denuclearisation talks.\n\nProtests, Brexit\n\nIn Hong Kong, rocked by months of sometimes violent pro-democracy demonstrations, protesters were urged to wear masks at a New Year rally called \u201cDon\u2019t forget 2019 - Persist in 2020,\u201d according to social media posts.\n\nSome 6,000 police were deployed and Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, appealed for calm and reconciliation in her New Year\u2019s Eve video message.\n\nThe protests began in June in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, and have evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.\n\nThousands of Indians ushered in the year by demonstrating against a citizenship law they say will discriminate against Muslims and chip away at India\u2019s secular Constitution.\n\nThe demonstrations came despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s attempts to dampen protests that have run for nearly three weeks.\n\nIrshad Alam, a 25-year-old resident of the Shaheen Bagh area of New Delhi, stood with his 1-year-old child in his arms and his wife by his side. He said he had been participating in the protest every day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s freezing here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are still here because we care about this movement.\u201d\n\nMore than three years after the UK voted to leave the European Union, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, fresh from winning a parliamentary majority in last month\u2019s election, promised in his New Year\u2019s message to \u201cget Brexit done before the end of this month.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we say goodbye to 2019, we can also turn the page on the division, rancour and uncertainty which has dominated public life and held us back for far too long,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nIn New York, large crowds were gathering ahead of the annual New Year\u2019s Eve ball drop over Times Square.\n\nFind latest and upcoming tech gadgets online on Tech2 Gadgets.
