Elizabeth Warren slammed Buttigieg for attending a fundraiser in a wine cave.\n\n\"The mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and $900-a-bottle wine,\" Warren said. \"He had promised that every fundraiser he would do would be open-door, but this one was closed-door. We made the decision many years ago that rich people in smoke-filled rooms would not pick the next president of the United States. Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Michelle Mark"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The figure is a remarkable one for a candidate who had very little national name recognition when he started his presidential bid early last year.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "//www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "title": "Pete Buttigieg raised $24.7 million in the final quarter, bringing his total 2019 haul to $76 million", "date": "2020-01-01", "news_keywords": "Pete Buttigieg, 2020 election, Fundraising, Michelle Mark", "description": "The figure is a remarkable one for a candidate who had very little national name recognition when he started his presidential bid early last year.", "author": "Michelle Mark", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Politics", "og": {"title": "Pete Buttigieg raised $24.7 million in the final quarter, bringing his total 2019 haul to $76 million", "description": "The figure is a remarkable one for a candidate who had very little national name recognition when he started his presidential bid early last year.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/pete-buttigieg-raised-247-million-in-final-quarter-2020-1", "image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5e0cda7a855cc2128363b1b2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "Pete Buttigieg raised $24.7 million in the final quarter, bringing his total 2019 haul to $76 million", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-01", "sailthru.tags": "Pete Buttigieg, 2020 election, Fundraising, Michelle Mark", "sailthru.description": "The figure is a remarkable one for a candidate who had very little national name recognition when he started his presidential bid early last year.", "sailthru.author": "Michelle Mark", "sailthru.verticals": "politics, news", "sailthru.image.full": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5e0cda88855cc217ce18ff12?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5e0cda88855cc217ce18ff12?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@PoliticsInsider"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"masthead": "variant", "commerce-menu-on-post": "variant", "bi6-under-bullets": "variant"}, "viking-id": "5e0ce13b855cc220925d1452", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/pete-buttigieg-raised-247-million-in-final-quarter-2020-1"}
