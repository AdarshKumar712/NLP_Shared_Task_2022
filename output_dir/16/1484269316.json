I typically don\u2019t like to make resolutions for the new year because they tend to feel like promises I\u2019ll break to myself around month three or four.\n\nBut in light of it being a new year and a new decade, I thought it made sense to set some goals for the health of my skin, hair, and nails. So I\u2019m starting off the 2020\u2019s with these 15 resolutions in a concerted effort to do better when it comes to my beauty habits. And this time I plan to make it through the entire year.\n\nWash my face twice daily. Celebrities like Ciara and La La Anthony pressed how necessary it is to wash your face in the morning and night. And based on the glow of their skin I would certainly take their advice. Washing at night is intuitive, but not in the morning. So I\u2019ve built a wake up routine to keep me on track. I\u2019m already starting to see a difference.\n\nTrim my hair every quarter. Hair growth guru Whitney Eaddy explained that excessive trimming is actually bad for hair growth. \u201cFor my clients, I say once a quarter, for some, every three and a half months. I have a proprietary trim that I developed because cosmetologists are taught to cut for shape, but not actually retention,\u201d she told ESSENCE. So I\u2019m taking my cues from her and her growing hands, and only trimming four times a year, and keeping that appointment.\n\nLearn to apply false lashes. I\u2019m very transparent about the fact that I am awful at putting on falsies. I can apply magnetics but not lashes that require glue. That limits the different styles I can wear. Right now I have several pairs of false lashes from brands such as KISS, Sephora, Absolute New York, and more. I\u2019m not willing to consistently pay for lash extensions so this is the year I master this.\n\nUse hair masks. With my low porosity hair it\u2019s always a process finding the right products. And even when I like a product I typically have to deep condition with a heat cap every time I wash with it. For that reason I\u2019ve stayed away from extra steps, like masks. But masks can be great for hydrating thirsty strands, and even for deep conditioning. This year I\u2019ll make sure I find the right masks, and start to reap their benefits for the sake of my strands.\n\nDrink more water. Every year I say I\u2019ll drink more water and every year I fail. It\u2019s mainly because I don\u2019t drink a lot of liquids overall. But your skin will always benefit from an abundance of clean water. It goes hand in hand with washing your face twice a day.\n\nDrink less wine. This goes hand in hand with drinking more water. I love wine, but alcohol undoubtedly ages your skin. If I can replace some of my wine with water I\u2019ll be on my way to truly making 40 look like the new 20.\n\nExperiment with hair color. It\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve colored my hair in an attempt to get it back to its virgin state. But when I see celebs like Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B sporting brightly colored tresses I get a little nostalgic. I don\u2019t necessarily need to dye my curls, but this year I want to explore more colored units, hair gels, and temporary color sprays.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nInvest in eco-friendly brands (specifically ones who cut down on plastic use). We had significant conversations about climate change in 2019 and it shook me. I realized that I needed to do more in my daily life to combat environmental issues. Most plastics are non-recyclable and they dominate when it comes to our beauty product containers. It\u2019ll take more work on my part to find the brands and products that use alternatives, but well worth it.\n\nDo more natural DIY skincare. One of my face washes contained something called sodium lauroamphoacetate. When I looked it up I still didn\u2019t understand what it was made of and why I needed it in my facial cleanser. That was one of 10 chemicals that I couldn\u2019t pronounce in this one product. It made me yearn for the days of avocado and banana masks to keep my breakouts at bay. So in 2020 there will be more of that, and less PEG 120 methyl glucose dioleate.\n\nDon\u2019t sweat the small stuff. Stress leads to breakouts, and breakouts stress you out. This year I\u2019m committing to spending less time worrying about the little daily stressors. This is a lofty goal for someone who lives in a city of more than 8 million people. More people, more problems. But I\u2019m also not going to obsess about the occasional pimple on the cheek, gray hair sprouting at the hairline, or quickly disintegrating manicure.\n\nTreat my edges like a newborn baby. I\u2019m going to feed them only the best stuff. I\u2019m going to care for them like they\u2019re delicate. I will massage them gently, and make sure I\u2019m doing the most to care for them daily. This year my edges will grow for me!\n\nBe consistent with supplements. I\u2019ve seen firsthand the benefits of supplements when I use them as directed, and consistently. It can feel like an extra thing to do in the morning but once you work it into your schedule it becomes second nature. I want enviable skin, hair, and nails for the next decade.\n\nAsk more questions. I\u2019m a journalist so I\u2019m always asking lots of questions, all the time. But when I\u2019m talking to brands about their ingredients claims I could stand to ask their reps more questions, not just my dermatologist. It\u2019s never enough to just know what\u2019s in your products, but it\u2019s imperative to know exactly what they do, and if they\u2019re worth what you\u2019re paying.\n\nEat less carbs. I love my pizza, pasta, breads, and chips, but all that stuff turns to sugar and sugar gives me pimples and rough skin. While health and beauty go hand in hand in many ways this is completely for skincare purposes. What you eat can show up on your face. A sugary face might sound like a sweet dream, but it\u2019s really an exfoliating nightmare.\n\nUse less products overall. It\u2019s so important to find what works for you and stick to those products. While I\u2019m never going to stop trying products (I\u2019m a beauty editor and a product lover), I\u2019ll be better about not switching my main items so often. This will keep the clogged pores away for face and hair.\n\nShare :", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Beauty", "new year beauty resolutions", "2020 beauty resolutions", "new years resolution"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "New year, new decade.
