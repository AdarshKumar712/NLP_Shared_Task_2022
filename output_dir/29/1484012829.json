Can a gun-wielding teacher really be expected to act in a regulated way to an individual threatening to shoot students and staff members?\n\nIt seems to me that too many \"decision makers\" overlook the importance of applying the tenets of social emotional learning in all situations.

The use of guns and other means of perpetrating acts of violence on the innocent are only symptomatic of troubled youth and a troubled society.\n\nProtecting our students while they are in school does not necessitate arming teachers and turning our school communities into the Old West. To my way of thinking, that's Barney Fife mentality at best.\n\nDouglas R.
