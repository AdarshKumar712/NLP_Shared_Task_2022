Road and Saint Aidan's Road.\n\nIt is unclear at this stage whether the woman had been crossing the road when she was struck.\n\nThe collision happened at 6.30pm on the road opposite Moorhill Primary School.\n\nThe woman was hit by a car, believed to be a silver VW Golf.\n\nShe died at the scene, say Staffordshire Police, as officers appealed for witnesses.\n\nPolice arrested a 27-year-old man from Cannock, at around 2.45am on New Year's Day, on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop.\n\nHe remained in custody for questioning today.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe woman's family have been informed and will be offered support from specially-trained officers, the force has said.\n\nReporter Dayna Farrington was at the scene today:\n\nThe woman, who was driving a mobility scooter at the time, was involved in a collision with a car, believed to be a silver VW Golf.\n\n\n\nDespite the best efforts of emergency service staff, she sadly died at the scene.

bang.\n\nAdvertising\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can say is that the ambulance and police response was amazing.\n\n\"They really tried to save her - they were doing CPR for 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n\"They arrived here so quick - there were three or four ambulances.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how it happened.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the lady but I think she used to be on her scooter around here with her granddaughter on her lap - I can\u2019t imagine how the family feels.\u201d\n\nTaped off\n\nOne Pye Green Road resident said: \u201cWe heard lots of fireworks going off and then just as they stopped we heard a really loud noise.\n\n\u201cThe road was all taped off last night. We couldn\u2019t get out the house for a few hours.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who the lady is. I stand out here and talk to everyone who goes past and I can\u2019t think who it could be.\"\n\nAnother added: \u201cWe came out the house and could see the lady lying in the road further down. The only thing we heard was a loud thud.\n\n\u201cThey had lots of police taking pictures of the area and forensics.\n\n\u201cThe road used to be a 20mph and it\u2019s near the school. The road has got worse since they built the new estates.\u201d\n\nThe collision happened at around 6.30pm on New Year's Eve\n\nPaul Wright said: \u201cWe were out having a meal in Ironbridge at the time it happened.\n\n\"Our doorbell camera went off - so I looked and texted my neighbour to ask what happened, and they said someone had been killed.\n\n\u201cOur camera started recording when the ambulances were outside and then it shows more police coming.\n\n\u201cWhen we realised what had happened we tried to come after we saw it but they would not let us in the road.\n\n\"They walked us around to our house and we had to park down the road.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the lady going past on her mobility scooter but we don\u2019t know her.\n\n\u201cAny other time we would have been in the house, as we are always in.\u201d\n\nIf anyone witnessed the collision or has any information that could help with the police investigation, including relevant dash cam footage, call 101 quoting incident 590 of December 31.\n\nAlternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or at crimestoppers-uk.org", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Dayna Farrington"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A woman on a mobility scooter has died after a suspected hit-and-run crash in Cannock prompting a police investigation.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/pb/resources/favicon-es.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "wBs4lXcL3o2OJ760vq8D8EjRvWpujRCD3Qwq6NdgnxM", "twitter": {"image": "https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/90h8WVjOD3hX0j1IBH6KQHGepHs=/1200x0/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-expressandstar-mna.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWA3XBC765HLJLGWZ2WOCNQBJQ.jpg", "site": "ExpressandStar", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Arrest made as woman on mobility scooter dies after 'hit-and-run' crash", "description": "A woman on a mobility scooter has died after a suspected hit-and-run crash in Cannock prompting a police investigation."}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Arrest made as woman on mobility scooter dies after 'hit-and-run' crash", "description": "A woman on a mobility scooter has died after a suspected hit-and-run crash in Cannock prompting a police investigation.", "image": "https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/90h8WVjOD3hX0j1IBH6KQHGepHs=/1200x0/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-expressandstar-mna.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWA3XBC765HLJLGWZ2WOCNQBJQ.jpg", "url": "https://www.expressandstar.com/news/crime/2020/01/01/woman-on-mobility-scooter-dies-after-hit-and-run-crash-in-cannock/"}, "pb": {"page-type": "story"}, "fb": {"app_id": 123889550967511}, "description": "A woman on a mobility scooter has died after a suspected hit-and-run crash in Cannock prompting a police investigation.", "author": "Dayna Farrington", "pb-site": "/news/crime", "story": {"": {"premium-flag": "Free"}}, "dfp": {"page-type": "story", "slot": "/news/crime", "story": "[\"IUDARLPMB5BRLJ2XXPY2NU6ZZU\",\"/news/crime/2020/01/01/woman-on-mobility-scooter-dies-after-hit-and-run-crash-in-cannock/\"]", "sites": "[\"/news/crime\",\"/news\",\"/news\",\"/news/local-hubs/staffordshire/cannock\",\"/news\",\"/news/local-hubs\",\"/news/local-hubs/staffordshire\",\"/news/local-hubs/staffordshire\",\"/news\",\"/news/local-hubs\",\"/news/local-hubs\",\"/news\",\"/top-stories/homepage\",\"/top-stories\",\"/top-stories\"]"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.expressandstar.com/news/crime/2020/01/01/woman-on-mobility-scooter-dies-after-hit-and-run-crash-in-cannock/"}
