Some residents on social media said they were turning their lights on inside their homes.\n\nIt had lightened up somewhat by noon.\n\nThere is also a smell of smoke in the city and in other parts of the South Island.\n\nPhoto: ODT / Gerard O'Brien\n\nOne asthma sufferer told the Otago Daily Times they would not be venturing outside today because of the risk the smoke would cause respiratory issues.\n\nPaul Bonner told the ODT that smoke was covering mountain tops in Queesntown and made for hazy-yellow skies in Cromwell.\n\nHe said smoke could be smelt and tasted in Queenstown, which could be problematic for asthmatics.\n\nResidents in Christchurch and Akaroa also shared images of yellow-hazy skies.\n\nHere's our resident Kereru in Green Island. pic.twitter.com/jC7f131gK1 \u2014 Brad Phipps (@bradphippsnz) December 31, 2019\n\nBush fire smoke has arrived in Wanaka.

Visibility in the smoke haze is as low as 10km in the worst affected areas. Southwesterlies are expected to gradually flush the smoke laden air away from late today ^AC pic.twitter.com/C5k0D4xvyu \u2014 MetService (@MetService) December 31, 2019\n\nA SnapitHD webcam captured the hazy sunrise over Wanaka this morning which many others across the country also experienced. This is due to smoke from the Australian bush fires being carried across the Tasman by an unbroken northwest flow. ^AC pic.twitter.com/Bo5T8LgOuJ \u2014 MetService (@MetService) December 31, 2019\n\nIt will move up the North Island in a few days but linger over the country until the weekend when a front will sweep it away.\n\nThe visiting smoke won't affect temperatures, but the northwest winds also visiting from across the Tasman may make overnight temperatures warmer.\n\n- This story first appeared on the Otago Daily Times website with additional reporting from the NZ Herald.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Radio New Zealand", "RNZ", "Public Radio", "News", "Current Affairs", "Audio", "Podcasts"], "tags": ["environment", "Otago"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 13:23:47 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Residents in parts of the South Island woke to strange yellow skies as smoke from Australia's bushfires drifts over New Zealand.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/x/favicons/apple-icon-57x57-eefff803139f2489c8070daecf6456be0034dd1dfc326746b70d9eb8e8232199.png", "meta_data": {"Generator": "ELF", "description": "Residents in parts of the South Island woke to strange yellow skies as smoke from Australia's bushfires drifts over New Zealand.", "keywords": "Radio New Zealand, RNZ, Public Radio, News, Current Affairs, Audio, Podcasts", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "EAL": "news:406523", "og": {"site_name": "RNZ", "url": "https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/406523/australia-fires-sending-pretty-hefty-smoke-new-zealand-s-way", "type": "article", "title": "Australia fires sending 'pretty hefty smoke' New Zealand's way", "description": "Residents in parts of the South Island woke to strange yellow skies as smoke from Australia's bushfires drifts over New Zealand.", "image": "https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/219261/eight_col_dark_dunedin.jpg?1577837431"}, "fb": {"admins": 1076742843, "pages": 116876028325133}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T13:23:47+13:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T13:23:47+13:00", "section": "New Zealand"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@rnz_news", "title": "Australia fires sending 'pretty hefty smoke' New Zealand's way", "description": "Residents in parts of the South Island woke to strange yellow skies as smoke from Australia's bushfires drifts over New Zealand.", "image": "https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/219261/eight_col_dark_dunedin.jpg?1577837431"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/x/favicons/ms-icon-144x144-cd317fd008139bc4fce0a2a9dd8c1ef48d95cf17810bfcb9b1336042f8203b2a.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/406523/australia-fires-sending-pretty-hefty-smoke-new-zealand-s-way"}
