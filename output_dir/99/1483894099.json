Sivan told a press conference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are targeting the launch for this year but it may spillover to next year,\" Sivan said. Indian sources said authorities had set November as a provisional target for launch.\n\nIndia seeking to become only the fourth nation after Russia, the United States and China to put a mission on the moon's surface and boost its credentials as a low-cost space power.\n\nThe country's Chandrayaan-2 module crash-landed on the moon's surface in September.\n\nSivan said the new propulsion module, lander and surface rover would cost about US$35 million, with a significantly higher outlay for the launch itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that India had chosen four candidate astronauts to take part in the country's first manned mission into orbit, pledged to take place by mid-2022.\n\nThe four are to start training in Russia later this month.
