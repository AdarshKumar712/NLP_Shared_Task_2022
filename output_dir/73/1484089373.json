Is immediately released by judgeJazz ShawPosted at 8:01 am on December 31, 2019New York City continues to descend into chaos under the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio, particularly when it comes to the rule of law. We\u2019ve already witnessed multiple instances of people dumping buckets of water on police officers as they perform their duties. There are weekly \u201cprotests\u201d in Brooklyn, where marching vandals chant \u201cF*** the Police\u201d and demand that the cops be banned from subway stations so they can more easily commit crimes. And in the latest incident, a suspect sucker-punched a member of the NYPD right in front of other officers. And thanks to the lax rules being pushed by City Hall, the suspect was back out on the street almost immediately.
