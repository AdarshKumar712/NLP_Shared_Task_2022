Do you have a plan in the works for working on that, as I believe it would help them establish residency and the first step towards possible citizenship.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, yes and yes,\u201d Biden answered. \u201cAnd, by the way, I\u2019m going to fundamentally change the immigration policy we have.\u201d\n\nIn a 2007 Democratic presidential primary debate, then-Sen. Biden replied \u201cno\u201d when asked if he supported granting drivers licenses to illegal immigrants.\n\nBiden cited his wife\u2019s recent trip to hand out Christmas presents to children in Mexico who were awaiting the processing of their asylum cases in the U.S., saying the children are living in \u201chobbles.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bizarre,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re ripping children from the arms of their mothers.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to sing the praises of DREAMers, saying \u201cthey\u2019re already Americans, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nThe remarks can be heard in the video below, just past the 17-minute mark:\n\n2020 candidate Joe Biden campaigns in Derry, New HampshireL IVE HAPPENING NOW: 2020 candidate Joe Biden campaigns in Derry, New Hampshire. https://abcn.ws/2K0BLjq Posted by ABC News on Monday, December 30, 2019\n\nBiden openly denounced the idea of hesitating to cross the southern border simply because it\u2019s a violation of the law.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I will do is send \u2014 I mean within the first couple of weeks, we already have it written \u2014 a bill to the U.S. Congress providing a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cSecond thing, I would surge, surge, to the border,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019d eliminate the proposal that \u2014 [President Trump] has as a fancy name but saying you can\u2019t come and make your asylum claim in the United States.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to talk about spending U.S. tax dollars in Central American countries \u2014 many of which are wholly corrupt \u2014 to improve conditions there to the point where migrants will have no reason to come to America.\n\nBiden\u2019s proposal on immigration includes a $4 billion assistance package south of the border, to include El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.\n\nIn addition to changing the policy on asylum, his plan would increase the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. and does not include funding for a border wall.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Tom Tillison", "Michelle Malkin", "Dennis Prager", "Stephen Moore", "Tucker Carlson", "Neil Patel", "Terence Jeffrey", "Chuck Norris", "John R.
