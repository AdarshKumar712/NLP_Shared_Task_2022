"Advertisement\n\nOne of the biggest peacetime evacuations in Australian history is under way as devastating bushfires threaten a 250km stretch of the south-east coastline.\n\nCatastrophic conditions which fanned blazes on the New South Wales south coast and in eastern Victoria on Wednesday will return on Saturday as the mercury hits 46C.\n\nThe NSW Rural Fire Service has told people to flee the area from Bateman's Bay down to the state border - as a navy landing ship prepares to evacuate people trapped in Mallacoota in eastern Victoria as roads are closed off.\n\n'If you are planning on visiting the South Coast this weekend, it is not safe. Do not be in the area on Saturday,' the service said.\n\nNSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance called it the 'largest evacuation of people out of the region ever' as a queue of cars clogged the highway toward Sydney while thousands fled.\n\nLocals and holidaymakers who decided to stay queued for hours for supplies as panic-buying emptied shelves at supermarkets which were powered by generators as electricity was turned off.\n\nAt 10am on Thursday the HMAS Choules and the MV Sycamore, a defence contracted training vessel, arrived off the coast of Mallacoota where 4,000 people are stranded - as troops in helicopters delivered food, water and medicine to isolated towns.\n\nThe ships will tomorrow morning carry hundreds from the town to either Western Port or Port Welshpool, depending on which has more favourable conditions.\n\nThose who choose to leave after three meetings with police and defence officials this afternoon and evening will be loaded at 7am via smaller boats.\n\nTourists and residents have been told to evacuate a 250km stretch of the New South Wales south coast as devastating bushfires threaten the area\n\nA firefighter sprays foam retardant on a back burn ahead of a fire front in the New South Wales town of Jerrawangala on January 1\n\nResidents met in the Mallacoota town hall on Thursday afternoon for an evacuation briefing by defence force officials\n\nLeft: Commanding Officer of HMAS Choules CMDR Scott Houlihan leading a liaison team to meet with community leaders in Mallacoota, Victoria.

The vessel was built by Swan Hunter in Wallsend, Tyne and Wear. She was named after Largs Bay in Ayrshire, Scotland. During her career with the RFA, Largs Bay served as the British ship assigned to patrol the Falkland Islands in 2008, and delivered relief supplies following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. When she was bought by Australia in 2011, she was re-named HMAS Choules. Advertisement\n\nMajor highways leading out of the leave zone, including the Princes Highway between Milton and Nowra, were reopened on Thursday. Falls Creek at Jervis Bay Road and Corks Lane at Milton has also reopened but with reduced speed.\n\nHowever, many people have struggled to flee as many petrol stations have either run out of fuel or are without power. Queues of cars have been seen at the remaining petrol stations around Batemans Bay that still have stock.\n\nTankers of 60,000 litres of fuel were brought in overnight to help with the disaster.\n\nVictorian Premier Daniel Andrews said in press conference on Thursday afternoon that 17 people are missing feared dead and one is confirmed dead after fires in Gippsland on Wednesday.\n\nTalking about the evacuation effort, he said the HMAS Choules was able to carry roughly 700 passengers at a time.\n\n'We think around 3,000 tourists and 1,000 locals are there. Not all of those will want to leave, not all can get on the vessel at one time,' he said.\n\n'Then there's a whole lot of planning going on about where that vessel will go, it will be a long trip, potentially a 10 or 12 hour trip to take them to another port and then to provide them with all the support they will need.'\n\nMeanwhile, Kosciuszko National Park is being evacuated ahead of Saturday. 'This is an essential measure to protect life,' National Parks and Wildlife has warned.\n\nHundreds of fires are burning out of control across the country in a horrific season which has killed 18 people, razed 1,298 homes and destroyed millions of hectares of land.\n\nThe NSW Rural Fire Service has told people to flee the area from Bateman's Bay down to the state border\n\nAn evacuation zone stretching more than 250 kilometers along the New South Wales South Coast has been set up as scorching temperatures and more devastating bushfires threaten the area\n\nThousands of people are stranded in the seaside town of Mallacoota (pictured trapped on the beach on Tuesday)\n\nThis picture taken on December 31, 2019 shows a firefighter hosing down trees and flying embers in an effort to secure nearby houses from bushfires near the town of Nowra on the NSW south coast\n\nBusiness owner Sally Anne Wilson (left) stands in front of her destroyed shop with her partner Christopher Lee in Cobargo, NSW, Wednesday, January 1, 2020\n\nOn Wednesday more than 300 residents were seen queuing outside a Woolworths in Ulladulla, NSW, which has experienced power outages\n\nThis satellite image shows the devastation of the fires devastating the coastal town of Batemans Bay, on the NSW south coast, early Wednesday morning as the blaze continues to spread\n\nHundreds of fires are still burning out of control across the country, destroying millions of hectares, killing 18 and leaving 1,200 homes destroyed, with catastrophic 46C weather forecast for Saturday\n\nWater supplies in towns in both Victoria and New South Wales have been affected by the fires.\n\nOn Tuesday boil notices were issued for Quaama, Cobargo, Bermagui, Beauty Point, Fairhaven, Wallaga Lake, Wallaga Lake Heights, Wallaga Lake Koori Village and Akolele after disinfection infrastructure was lost.\n\nPower was restored to 11,000 homes in New South Wales' South Coast on Wednesday but more than 30,000 people are still without electricity or internet.\n\nPeople who had suffered horrific burns or were injured in the fires were forced to wait for more than 24 hours until they were rescued by the Navy as roads remain closed.\n\nSince Monday, eight have been killed and four are missing feared dead in the fires in NSW and Victoria.\n\nOn Wednesday a 42-year-old man was rescued by a Navy helicopter from Cadgee, south of Moruya, and a 49-year-old woman and 23-year-old woman were rescued from Nowra.\n\nTourists walk through dense smoke from bushfires in front of the Batemans Bay bridge as cars line up to leave the town in New South Wales to head north on January 2\n\nTraffic has been barely moving as hundreds flee Batemans Bay in New South Wales before temperatures skyrocket on Saturday\n\nAUSTRALIA'S BUSHFIRE CRISIS AT A GLANCE NEW SOUTH WALES: -

Sussex Inlet man David Warner was among a group of locals who had travelled to Nowra by bus before the Princes Highway was blocked off on Tuesday. 'When we came in, everything was blue, it was all good and then 11 o'clock (there was) all these fires, smoke, sirens everywhere,' Mr Warner told AAP on Wednesday. 'I said, we're not going to get back.' Unlike those who had evacuated to Bomaderry Bowling Club, Mr Warner had nothing with him. He said those running the centre were very nice but 'none of us slept at all'. 'It was shocking,' he said. 'I will never forget this New Year's. 'It'll be stuck in my head 'til the day I die.' Near people and their pets - including dogs, cats and a tortoise - he watched Sydney's famous foreshore fireworks on a giant projection screen hanging at the front of the room as sausage sandwiches were served. 'I forgot it was New Year's actually because of all of what was going on,' Mr Warner said. Reality hit home on Wednesday as information from Sussex Inlet began filtering through the evacuation centre. The body of a yet-to-be-identified man was found about midday in a vehicle on Wandra Road. Sussex Inlet was a community where 'everyone knows everyone', Mr Warner said. 'I'm a bit upset about it because I don't know who it is, and we know a lot of people in Sussex,' he said. Crews on Wednesday built containment lines around the massive Currowan fire that impacted Sussex Inlet and other towns over a 100km stretch of the coast. A watch-and-act alert advises communities to monitor conditions, beware of falling trees and seek shelter as the firefront approaches.

Mick Roberts had not made contact with family for more than 24 hours and on Wednesday his niece Leah Parson confirmed he had been found dead at his Buchan home. 'He's not missing anymore,' Ms Parsons wrote on the East Gippsland fire season 2019-2020 Facebook page. 'His body has been found in his house..very sad day for us to srart (sic) the year but we're a bloody tight family and we will never forget our mate and my beautiful Uncle Mick.' Victoria Police said a person had been found dead in Buchan, but the cause of his death has not yet been confirmed. Earlier on Wednesday Premier Daniel Andrews said four people were still missing, but would not say what communities in East Gippsland the people belonged to. 'Everything is being done to try and establish the whereabouts of these people,' he told reporters at the Bairnsdale incident control centre. Mr Andrews lamented reports of Mr Roberts' death. 'It is of course the worst of all news, the notion that someone has lost their life,' he told ABC Gippsland. After spending more than a day on emergency alert, the bushfire threat in East Gippsland and at Corryong in northeast Victoria was downgraded to watch and acts. More than 500,000 hectares have been burnt, after three fires in East Gippsland combined on Tuesday. The blaze at Corryong has burnt at least 109,000 hectares. The total area burnt has exceeded that of the Black Saturday bushfires of February 2009. There were more than 40 fires still burning across Victoria at 9:30pm on Wednesday with 11 at the watch and act level. The risk of flare-ups elsewhere remains. Conditions are expected to worsen on Saturday and dry lightning has continued to spark new fires. Mr Andrews spent Wednesday in East Gippsland where he said emotions were running high. 'I spoke with people today and they just said it was hurricane-like, horrifying, terrifying, the most frightening experience of their life.' 'The next few days are going to be a lot of hard work and the next few months will be a very long and steady process of helping these communities to rebuild,' the premier said. So far, confirmed property losses are 24 structures at Buchan, 19 at Sarsfield, 10 at Mallacoota and up to 15 at Cudgewa. Power has been cut to more than 7000 properties at East Gippsland and more than 1800 in the northeast. AusNet said it could take days to restore power because it was unsafe to attend and assess the extent of damage. Phones remain cut across much of the region and people are struggling to communicate with loved ones and get the latest information on the fire risk. A boil water notice was put in place for Mallacoota, an isolated coastal holiday town near the NSW border, from Tuesday to reduce public health risks. A NSW police boat brought in water to Mallacoota on Tuesday and a Victoria water police boat is taking 1.6 tonnes of water on Wednesday. A barge from Melbourne with two weeks' supply of food, water and fuel is also making its way to the town. After a request from the premier on Tuesday, military personnel have begun helping with the relief effort, including undertaking rapid damage assessments. Aircraft including Black Hawk helicopters are expected to land in the east of the state on Wednesday with other aircraft and naval vessels due in coming days to move people out of the area. Naval vessels including HMAS Choules left Sydney bound for the East Gippsland coast on Tuesday evening and training vessel MV Sycamore has also been deployed.

The recent deaths include dairy farmer Patrick Salway, 29, and his father Robert, 63, who died trying to save their property in Cobargo, near Bega. A 70-year-old man was found dead outside a home at Yatte Yattah, west of Lake Conjola, on Tuesday night, while another man's body was found in a burnt vehicle on a road off the Princes Highway at Yatte Yattah Wednesday morning. The body of a man was found in a vehicle on Wandra Road at Sussex Inlet about 11.30am Wednesday but is yet to be formally identified, while a seventh body was found outside a home Coolagolite, about 10km east of Cobargo, on Wednesday. Beloved great-grandfather Mick Roberts, 67, from Buchan, in East Gippsland, was found dead at his home on Wednesday morning. On Sunday, young father and volunteer firefighter Samuel McPaul, 28, was fighting a blaze in Jingellic, in Green Valley, about 70km east of Albury on the border of NSW and Victoria, when the truck he was in rolled, killing him instantly. Two other firefighters died on December 19 after a tree fell on their truck while they were travelling through Buxton, south of Sydney. Andrew O'Dwyer, 36, and Geoffrey Keaton, 32, were later named as the volunteers involved in the tragic accident the following day. Both men were young fathers and had volunteered with the Horsley Park Rural Fire Service brigade for more than a decade. Two people also died in South Australian fires before Christmas, including 69-year-old engineer Ron Selth. His body was found in his Charleston home, which was destroyed by the Cudlee Creek blaze on December 21. Another person died in a fiery car crash on the same day. In early November, just weeks into the horror fire season which has been baring down on the nation for months, three people perished in northern NSW. George Nole's body was found in a burnt out car near his home in Glen Innes while 63-year-old Julie Fletcher's body was pulled from a scorched building in Johns River, north of Taree. Vivian Chaplain, a 69-year-old woman from Wytaliba, succumbed to her injuries in hospital after attempting in vain to save her home and animals from the blaze. The fourth victim was named just days later as 58-year-old Barry Parsons. His body was discovered in bushland on the southern end of the Kyuna Track at Willawarrin, near Kempsey, on November 13. 77-year-old Bob Lindsey and 68-year-old Gwen Hyde were found in their burned out property on October 9th.
