(AP Photo/John Raoux)\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Mac Jones threw three touchdown passes, Jerry Jeudy became the first Alabama player to top 200 receiving yards in a bowl game and the ninth-ranked Crimson Tide topped No. 17 Michigan 35-16 on Wednesday in the Citrus Bowl.\n\nJones connected with Jeudy for an 85-yard score on Alabama\u2019s first snap, DeVonta Smith and Miller Forristall added touchdown grabs in the second half for the Crimson Tide (11-2), which trailed 16-14 at the break. Najee Harris ran for 136 yards and two touchdowns for Alabama.\n\nJeudy finished with six catches for 204 yards. His previous career-high for yards was 147 set last season against Missouri, and the Alabama bowl record had stood for more than a half-century \u2014 Ray Perkins had 178 yards against Nebraska in the 1967 Sugar Bowl.\n\nJones \u2014 who took over as Alabama\u2019s starter when Tua Tagovailoa was lost for the season with an injury in November \u2014 completed 16 of 25 passes for 327 yards.\n\nShea Patterson completed 17 of 37 passes for 233 yards and a touchdown for Michigan (9-4), which dropped its fourth consecutive bowl game. Quinn Nordin kicked three field goals for the Wolverines, including a school-record-tying 57-yarder to end the first half and give Michigan the lead.\n\nThe Crimson Tide had two touchdown drives of 90 seconds or less \u2014 Jeudy\u2019s score on Alabama\u2019s first play and a long go-ahead touchdown grab by Smith early in the third quarter. They were quick-strike all season long, with 22 TD drives taking 1:30 or less and 38 TDs coming in 2:00 or less.\n\nAnd the last of those was the one that put this game away for Alabama with 10:01 left.\n\nFacing 3rd-and-11 from its own 8, Jones connected with Jeudy for 14 yards. On the next snap, Jones and Jeudy hooked up for 58 more yards. And the next snap was a 20-yard scoring pass to a wide-open Forristall.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMichigan: The Wolverines have dropped 16 straight road or neutral-site games against teams ranked No. 15 or higher in the AP poll, including all 10 under coach Jim Harbaugh. The last time the Wolverines won such a game was Jan. 3, 2012 over then-No. 11 Virginia Tech.\n\nAlabama: It was the 12th bowl or playoff-game win for Alabama coach Nick Saban. That tied him with Paul \u201cBear\u201d Bryant for the most in school history. And the Crimson Tide won their 27th consecutive game when allowing less than 40 points.\n\nPLAYING\n\nWR Henry Ruggs III \u2014 a 2020 first-round draft possibility if he skips his senior season \u2014 was injured with 9:30 left in the third quarter and limped off while being assisted by athletic trainers. The Crimson Tide had only two players skip the bowl game for draft preparation, cornerback Trevon Diggs and linebacker Terrell Lewis. Ruggs was part of a draft-possible group that decided to play, along with Jeudy and Harris.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nAlabama should stay in the top 10 for the 76th consecutive edition of the AP Top 25, moving into a tie for the fifth-longest streak in poll history.\n\nNORDIN\u2019S DAY\n\nAlong with the school-record-tying 57-yarder to end the half \u2014 Hayden Epstein also connected from 57 yards out in the first quarter at Michigan State on Nov. 3, 2001 \u2014 Nordin finished the day 3 for 3 on field-goal tries. It wrapped up a perfect season for kickers facing the Crimson Tide: They went 20 for 20 on field goals.\n\nSPECIAL GUEST\n\nMiami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross and members of the team\u2019s front office were on the field pregame, watching warmups. Ross is a prominent Michigan alum \u2014 there is a Stephen M. Ross Athletic Campus spanning 280,000 square feet in Ann Arbor. And the Dolphins are also one of the teams that seem likely to consider drafting Tagovailoa if he turns pro.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMichigan: Opens next season on Sept. 5 at Washington, the first meeting between those schools in 18 years. It begins a home-and-home, with the Huskies going to Ann Arbor on Sept. 11, 2021.\n\nAlabama: Opens next season on Sept. 5 against USC in Arlington, Texas. It\u2019ll be the ninth consecutive season in which the Crimson Tide open with a neutral-site game; they\u2019re 8-0 so far in those.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Woodtv.Com Staff", "Tim Reynolds", "Ap Sports Writer"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 21:54:51 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The ninth-ranked Crimson Tide topped No. 17 Michigan on Wednesday in the Citrus Bowl.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2019/06/apple-touch-icon-ipad-retina.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The ninth-ranked Crimson Tide topped No. 17 Michigan on Wednesday in the Citrus Bowl.", "google-site-verification": "gKj0lWijXfErJ6h4PEjVEDPLG59thjTVrZkmGuDONu0", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "fb": {"pages": 20114386235}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Michigan loses to Alabama in Citrus Bowl", "url": "https://www.woodtv.com/ncaa/ncaa-football/michigan-loses-to-alabama-in-citrus-bowl/", "description": "The ninth-ranked Crimson Tide topped No. 17 Michigan on Wednesday in the Citrus Bowl.", "site_name": "WOODTV.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2020/01/AP_20001729756789.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "secure_url": "https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2020/01/AP_20001729756789.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T21:54:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T21:54:52+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Michigan loses to Alabama in Citrus Bowl"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2020/01/AP_20001729756789.jpg?w=640", "alt": "Michigan Alabama Citrus Bowl"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Michigan loses to Alabama in Citrus Bowl", "description": "The ninth-ranked Crimson Tide topped No. 17 Michigan on Wednesday in the Citrus Bowl."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2019/06/apple-touch-icon-ipad-retina.png?w=152"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.woodtv.com/ncaa/ncaa-football/michigan-loses-to-alabama-in-citrus-bowl/"}
