A notification in this regard has been issued by the finance ministry.\n\nThe duty cut has been made under the ASEAN agreement and the India-Malaysia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (IMCECA), the notification added. Opposing the move, the Solvent Extractors\u2019 Association of India (SEA) said that after the reduction in import duty, the tax difference between CPO and refined palmolein has reduced from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent. \u201cThis will have serious impact on domestic palm oil refining industry and oilseeds farmers. We fear import of refined palmolien would increase and capacity utilisation of our industry would be affected leading to potential loss of employment,\u201d SEA Executive Director B V Mehta said in a statement.\n\nAfter a long time, the domestic oilseeds had started selling their produce above the minimum support price (MSP). \u201cLower import duty would make it difficult to defend MSP and the new found enthusiasm of the oilseed farmers would be dampened,\u201d he said. The country\u2019s edible oil imports are now touching 70 per cent of the consumption. The duty cut would be counterproductive and contrary to the government\u2019s stated objective of increasing domestic oilseed production, he added. Asserting that India too should protect the interest of farmers like Malaysia and Indonesia, the SEA said Indonesia from January 1 has imposed export duty of USD 50 on CPO and USD 30 on refined palmolien.\n\nSimilarly, Malaysia has imposed export duty of USD 31 on CPO and zero duty on refined palmolein which work out to be nearly 5 per cent on CPO value, thus effective duty difference is hardly 2.5 per cent only. \u201cWe strongly appeal to the government to increase the duty differential between CPO and refined palm oil to 15 per cent, by taking appropriate measures,\u201d the industry body added.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["sea executive director b v mehta", "solvent extractors' association of india", "malaysia", "comprehensive economic cooperation agreement", "minimum support price"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 21:11:23 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "After a long time, the domestic oilseeds had started selling their produce above the minimum support price (MSP).", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://images.financialexpress.com/2018/10/fe-fav-1.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1100", "ahrefs-site-verification": "00120a3a212c33eda15559fea6d0731769fd82f538180bd0a2dbe12991312ab4", "description": "After a long time, the domestic oilseeds had started selling their produce above the minimum support price (MSP).", "news_keywords": "SEA Executive Director B V Mehta , Solvent Extractors' Association of India, Malaysia, Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, minimum support price", "keywords": "sea executive director b v mehta , solvent extractors' association of india, malaysia, comprehensive economic cooperation agreement, minimum support price", "msvalidate.01": "CCA9DA5B985004F4462DA743E776C636", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.financialexpress.com/market/commodities/big-cut-on-import-duty-on-crude-and-refined-palm-oils-industry-says-move-to-hurt-domestic-refiners/1809857/", "site_name": "The Financial Express", "title": "Big cut on import duty on crude and refined palm oils; Industry says move to hurt domestic\u00a0refiners", "description": "After a long time, the domestic oilseeds had started selling their produce above the minimum support price (MSP).", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.financialexpress.com/2020/01/cats-81.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 660, "height": 440}, "updated_time": "2020-01-01T21:11:23+05:30"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@FinancialXpress", "title": "Big cut on import duty on crude and refined palm oils; Industry says move to hurt domestic\u00a0refiners", "description": "After a long time, the domestic oilseeds had started selling their produce above the minimum support price (MSP).", "creator": "@FinancialXpress", "url": "https://www.financialexpress.com/market/commodities/big-cut-on-import-duty-on-crude-and-refined-palm-oils-industry-says-move-to-hurt-domestic-refiners/1809857/", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.financialexpress.com/2020/01/cats-81.jpg", "width": 660, "height": 440}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T21:11:23+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T21:11:23+05:30"}, "google-site-verification": "gnihf3YiUuUdPvHPclHT6JNmAwi1ues6l85YQL-3g8I", "generator": "WordPress 4.9.4", "fb": {"pages": 157671354275436}, "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://www.financialexpress.com/market/commodities/big-cut-on-import-duty-on-crude-and-refined-palm-oils-industry-says-move-to-hurt-domestic-refiners/1809857/?ia_markup=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://images.financialexpress.com/2018/10/fe-fav-1.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.financialexpress.com/market/commodities/big-cut-on-import-duty-on-crude-and-refined-palm-oils-industry-says-move-to-hurt-domestic-refiners/1809857/"}
