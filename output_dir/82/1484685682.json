The Hollywood Foreign Press Association said Thursday that it wants the initiative to raise environmental awareness about food consumption and waste.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a way we can, not change the world, but save the planet, maybe we can get the Golden Globes to send a signal and draw attention to the issue about climate change,\u201d HFPA president Lorenzo Soria said. \u201cThe food we eat, the way we grow the food we eat, the way we dispose of the food is one of the large contributors to the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nThe annual awards ceremony will air on NBC from The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nSoria said there was some initial push back about changing the menu just about two weeks before the show, but the hotel eventually agreed on the new menu.\n\n\u201cPeople were basically saying it\u2019s too late, we\u2019re ready with all the orders, the holidays and all that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after we began discussions, meeting for one or two days, (the hotel) accepted the change completely. They started to experiment with how to do plant-based meals that was not just their symbolic steps, but also something that guests will enjoy.\u201d\n\nMatthew Morgan, executive chef at The Beverly Hilton, called the menu change initially surprising. But he ultimately understood it would send a positive message.\n\n\u201cIt was a little shocking when first mentioned, because of being very close to the actual Globes and having already decided on a menu,\u201d he said. \u201cBut once we thought about it and the message that it sent, we were really excited about it. That\u2019s something I stand behind myself.\u201d\n\nItems on the main entree include king oyster mushrooms scallops and wild mushroom risotto, along with roasted baby purple and green Brussels sprouts and carrots. A chilled golden beet soup will be served as an appetizer.\n\nHFPA partnered with Icelandic Glacial, a naturally alkaline and sustainably-sourced natural spring water. The water will be served in glass bottles to eliminate plastic waste in the ballroom and red carpet, which is reused at other events throughout the year.\n\nSoria called the food \u201cexcellent\u201d after a recent taste-testing.\n\nMorgan said making the change wasn\u2019t too difficult. He said the first course was already vegan and the main course was a vegan alternate in which they enhanced the dish to add some \u201cpop and color to the plate.\u201d\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Associated Press.
