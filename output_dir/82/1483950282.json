National Weather Service meteorologists said accumulating snow is expected in the western and central parts of the state, especially in the northern mountains. An accumulation of an inch or less is predicted for the Albuquerque metro on Thursday, with a little more than an inch expected in Santa Fe. A few additional inches are possible in the northern mountains. Rain mixed with snow is expected to spread across the eastern plains on Thursday.\n\nCold temperatures are expected to remain throughout the week, with a possible warming trend coming during the weekend. Temperatures are expected to be between 5 to 10 degrees below normal Tuesday into Wednesday. The weather service is urging residents to protect pipes, pets and plants over the next couple days. Highs in the 40s and lows in the mid and low 20s are expected through the remainder of the week in the Albuquerque metro. Low temperatures are expected to be in the teens or single digits in northern New Mexico.\n\nRoads are expected to be slick in the western part of the state and in the northern mountains Wednesday night into Thursday. Gusty winds could also make travel hazardous along the I-40 corridor in eastern New Mexico.\n\nCold, drier weather is expected Friday, with warmer temperatures Saturday and much of Sunday before another storm system moves across the state bringing more chances of snow late Sunday into Monday.\n\nADVERTISEMENTSkip\n\n................................................................", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Scott Turner", "Journal Staff Writer"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 New Year's Eve revelers can expect a chilly end to 2019.
