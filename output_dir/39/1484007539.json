It does not deal with conflicts between countries and it does not sue countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf and when it is opened, the General Prosecutor\u2019s office will manage an independent investigation with no inquiries, and which will be based only on proofs. In the court\u2019s process, according to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, every suspect enjoys the required legal guarantees, including the presumption of innocence from crime until his guilt is proven, and the right to a lawyer of his choosing.\u201d\n\nLast week, the ICC said it will launch a full investigation into war crimes in the Palestinian territories, a move welcomed by the Palestinian government.\n\nBensouda said the preliminary examination into war crimes, opened in 2015, had rendered enough information to meet all criteria for opening an investigation.\n\nOver 30 lawyers in the Palestinian occupied territories helped draft the fresh dossier.\n\nGaza, with a population of more than 1.8 million, has been under siege by the Israeli regime since June 2007. The blockade has caused a decline in the standards of living as well as unprecedented levels of unemployment and unrelenting poverty.\n\nA UN fact-finding mission said in March that Israeli forces committed rights violations during their crackdown against Palestinian protesters in the Gaza Strip last year that may amount to \u201cwar crimes,\u201d urging the regime\u2019s military to prevent its snipers from using lethal force against the demonstrators.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sun Dec 29 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://english.pnn.ps/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Bensouda: No charges against Israelis nor Palestinians yet - PNN", "type": "article", "description": "PNN/ Bethlehem/ Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) said that no charges have been", "url": "http://english.pnn.ps/2019/12/29/bensouda-no-charges-against-israelis-nor-palestinians-yet/", "site_name": "PNN", "image": "http://english.pnn.ps/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Fatou-Bensouda-660x330.jpg"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 1.0.2", "viewport": "width=1045"}, "canonical_link": "http://english.pnn.ps/2019/12/29/bensouda-no-charges-against-israelis-nor-palestinians-yet/"}
