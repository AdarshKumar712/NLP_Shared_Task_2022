There are some workers that are receiving only N7000 because the wage bill almost tallies with monthly allocation and the internally generated revenue (IGR) is declining.\n\n\u201cIn the next two weeks the public would know the outcome of the investigation, we would name all the officials involved and the banks that are aiding them in committing the fraud. We would submit the banks\u2019 names to the Central Bank of Nigeria for further disciplinary action.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, most of the directors in the ministry have over ten people that they employed illegally receiving more than twenty million naira on monthly basis.\n\nHe noted that one Hannatu Shehu Idris, a sister to the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was receiving not less than N250,000 every month without justifying the salary.\n\n\u201cAs of now, we have detected 4,972 ghost workers receiving salaries without justifying their salaries and this has to be stopped immediately,\u201d he lamented.\n\nThe commissioner noted that there are so many governmental agencies where such dubious activities were being carried on without the public knowing what was in the offing.\n\n\u201cWe are now set to expose their dubious activities because the state is getting better now than ever before,\u201d his said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["zamfara"], "authors": ["Ifeanyi Nwannah"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Zamfara State government has said it has suspended three directors and five officials of the state Ministry of Finance over an alleged appointment", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cropped-DAILY-POST-ICON-32x32.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Zamfara State government has said it has suspended three directors and five officials of the state Ministry of Finance over an alleged appointment", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Zamfara govt suspends three directors, five officials over alleged salary scam - Daily Post Nigeria", "description": "The Zamfara State government has said it has suspended three directors and five officials of the state Ministry of Finance over an alleged appointment", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2020/01/01/zamfara-govt-suspends-three-directors-five-officials-over-alleged-salary-scam/", "site_name": "Daily Post Nigeria", "updated_time": "2020-01-01T09:40:16+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/RLKdiQVm.jpeg", "secure_url": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/RLKdiQVm.jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyPostNigeria/", "tag": "zamfara", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T08:38:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T09:40:16+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 420332301344305}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Zamfara State government has said it has suspended three directors and five officials of the state Ministry of Finance over an alleged appointment", "title": "Zamfara govt suspends three directors, five officials over alleged salary scam - Daily Post Nigeria", "site": "@dailypostngr", "image": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/RLKdiQVm.jpeg", "creator": "@dailypostngr"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cropped-DAILY-POST-ICON-270x270.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://dailypost.ng/2020/01/01/zamfara-govt-suspends-three-directors-five-officials-over-alleged-salary-scam/"}
