Her son, Jesse Jakob Estala, 19, is blind and has a traumatic brain injury from a boating accident 10 years ago. Beakley needs an attorney who specializes in guardianships and long-term care for people with special needs. She would like a therapist who specializes in traumatic brain injuries for her son. She needs a more supportive couch, and gas cards, bus passes and hotel vouchers for travel to MD Anderson.

					<p><p>When the 12 featured Season for Caring families woke up this New Year&#8217;s Day, they saw new things that weren&#8217;t there last New Year&#8217;s. Comfortable beds for every family member from Factory Mattress. Laptops from an anonymous donor. Gifts given by school kids, Austin families or businesses. Items purchased by their local nonprofit agencies using Season for Caring money contributed by people throughout Central Texas.</p><br><p>They woke up with a new sense of hope, a new sense of security.</p><br><p>Since the 21st Statesman Season for Caring launched on Dec. 1, Central Texans have contributed $589,585 in monetary donations and $185,395 in in-kind goods and services, for a total of $774,980. Donations can continue to be made through Jan. 31. </p><br><p>The nonprofit organizations will use the monetary donations to help complete the featured families&#8217; wish lists first, but then will be able to help hundreds of other families throughout the year with basic needs such as groceries, medications, rent, utilities, bus passes and gas cards.</p><br><p>Since 1999, Season for Caring has given more than $13.4 million to local nonprofit organizations.</p><br><p>Unlike some years when most of the featured families&#8217; wish lists are close to being completed by New Year&#8217;s Day, many of the families have not seen an outpouring of in-kind donations this year. They have items both big and small remaining.</p><br><p>Kevin Moreno, 23, who has kept his family &#8212; including 19-year-old brother Dylan and 6-year-old sister Avia &#8212; from homelessness since he was 16, needs a second car and car repairs for the family&#8217;s current car. The Morenos also need a microwave, textbook expenses for Dylan, tuition for Kevin to go to college, living room furniture, a dining room table that seats six, a TV stand, wall shelving and organizational systems.

Her biggest needs are airline tickets to bring the rest of the family here, as well as help establishing permanent residency. She also needs a reliable car. The girls need bigger car seats, bedding, and gift cards for clothing. The family also needs many storage systems such as shelves, dressers and boxes for under the bed.
