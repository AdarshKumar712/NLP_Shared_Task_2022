vulnerable people living in South Africa.\n\nFrom ongoing attacks on women and children, to the apparent targeting of foreign nationals and the deployment of the army to the Cape Flats \u2013 violence grabbed the headlines and the attention of citizens in 2019, who registered their horror and marched in protest to make their voices heard.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa also cancelled travel plans and important economic forum appearances to address the nation, and come up with measures to show that the government was serious about the levels of angst in the country.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nCape Flats\n\nThere has been an all-out war on the Cape Flats for many years as gangs continue to fight it out for turf and power.\n\nThose who try to go about their daily lives often end up with the bullet wounds \u2013 unarmed men, women and children fall while walking or running to their homes, hiding away or playing outside.\n\nThis bloodshed is reflected in official crime statistics.\n\nThe Cape Flats is home to the Western Cape's 10 police precincts which have the highest attempted murder rates, contributing to 42% of the attempted murders in the province.\n\nFor years, many in the community, along with the City of Cape Town and the DA, have been calling for the army to intervene and help the police enforce law and order.\n\nTheir pleas were finally heard in July following a heightened spate of recorded murders. Police Minister Bheki Cele announced then that the army would be deployed to help stabilise ganglands in these 10 areas.\n\nThis was after Ramaphosa finally gave the go-ahead and wrote up the legally required letter to Parliament. He has since extended the deployment until March, 2020.\n\nBut there is still bloodshed.\n\nA night of horror unfolded in Delft in August when separate shootings left three people dead and several others injured.\n\nIn September, gunmen kicked down the door of a structure in Elsies River and mowed down three children and a teenager.\n\nLast month, three men and a woman were shot dead in their home in Mitchells Plain.\n\nAnd in December, notorious gang leader Rashied Staggie was gunned down outside his Salt River home in the early hours of a Friday morning.\n\nIt remains to be seen what long-term impact the army will have in Bishop Lavis, Mitchells Plain, Delft, Elsies River, Nyanga, Khayelitsha, Mfuleni, Philippi, Kraaifontein and Manenberg.\n\nCele proudly stated in September that the work of the police, together with the SA National Defence Force, had resulted in more than 1 000 arrests in gang-ridden areas.\n\nOf those, 806 were already in the system and were wanted for various crimes, including murder, attempted murder, hijacking and theft.\n\nPeople are still being killed and, as stated by the Institute for Security Studies' Dr Johan Burger, the army, due to leave in March, cannot do the police's job.\n\n#AmINext\n\nThe murder of University of Cape Town student Uyinene Mrwetyana, 19, at a Cape Town post office shocked the nation, coming at a time where many murders of young women were being reported.\n\nHorror killings hogged the headlines, such as that of South African boxer Leighandre \"Baby Lee\" Jegels, University of Western Cape student Jesse Hess, horse-riding enthusiast Meghan Cremer and Cape Town resident Lynette Volschenk, who was dismembered in her home.\n\nIn Mrwetyana's case, it emerged that post office employee Luyanda Botha lured her there on August 24 and when she didn't welcome his sexual advances, raped her and used a 2kg weight, used to weigh packages, to bludgeon her to death. He then hid her body in the office safe, before transporting it the next day, to be burnt and buried.\n\nThe nature of her murder, committed by a government employee in a public building in the afternoon, shocked the country. Women took to social media to express that they were not safe anywhere, not even in a public place or if they were equipped with self-defence skills.\n\nProtesters gather to hand over a memorandum of grievances during a gender-based violence demonstration outside Parliament. (Photo by Gallo Images/Ziyaad Douglas)\n\nThe senseless killings prompted the nationwide #AmINext movement, with victims of abuse calling out their alleged abusers, which was documented on a viral thread on Twitter.\n\n\n\nIt sparked marches and protests across the country against gender-based violence, including and especially at universities, where students demanded that campuses be made safer.\n\nEven international delegates attending the World Economic Forum in Cape Town were confronted with the chants of protesters who cried out for something to be done about the high rate of rapes and murders.\n\nRiot police were brought in as the group, many students, demanded to address Ramaphosa.\n\nIronically, their cries for an end to violence were met with a heavy-handed approach in the form of stun grenades and several arrests.\n\nLast month, Botha was sentenced to life in prison for murder, two life sentences for both counts of rape, and five years for defeating the course of justice, in terms of a plea and sentencing agreement.\n\nXenophobia\n\nAt around the same time, foreign nationals in Gauteng bore the brunt of sporadic violence across all three of the province's major metros.\n\nCommunities looted both foreign-owned and local shops while calling for an end to drug syndicates.\n\nTen of the 12 people killed in the ensuing violence were South Africans, and Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said the evidence did not show that foreign nationals were being targeted because of their nationality.\n\nShe reiterated that South Africa was not a xenophobic country.\n\nPressure was on Ramaphosa to give an official response to both the gender-based violence and the apparent xenophobic violence.\n\nMarchers against xenophobia in Johannesburg in April 2015. (PHOTO: Bridget Mnyulwa of Sonke Gender Justice)\n\nHe did so in an address to the nation on television, calling for calm and acknowledging that the period had been traumatic for the country.\n\n\n\nHe also opted out of the UN General Assembly in New York in September.\n\nUsing a provision in the Constitution normally called upon for State of the Nation Addresses, he held an extraordinary sitting of Parliament instead to tackle gender-based violence and femicide.\n\n\"There were 52 000 sexual offences reported in SA in 2018/19. Over the last weeks\u2026 we have been shaken by the brutal killings of women and acts of violence have just really exploded in this province,\" he told residents at Lusikisiki College in the Eastern Cape.\n\nThe result of the extraordinary sitting was a five-point emergency plan to be implemented over six months.\n\nPack up and go\n\nLater that month, Ramaphosa was booed while delivering a speech at a memorial for former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe in Harare.\n\nHe said Zimbabweans only accepted him after he offered an apology for the violence committed against foreign nationals.\n\n\"It was only when I said I regret what is happening in our country and offered an apology on behalf of all of us as SA, that is when they responded positively in accepting that apology. I have apologised on your behalf and I hope that will sink into our consciousness.\"\n\nHe added: \"The world expects us to behave in a way where we respect the rights of people from other nations.\"\n\nDesperate Nigerians living in South Africa, including some who were forced to close their businesses following the attacks on foreign nationals, signed up for free flights back to Nigeria, instead of taking the risk of staying.\n\nIn Cape Town and Pretoria, groups of foreign nationals pleaded with the United Nations in weeks of protests outside their regional offices to be taken to another country.\n\nWhere to next?\n\nWhile the government follows its plan to tackle gender-based violence, stories continue to emerge of women who are killed.\n\nLast month, 21-year-old Limpopo student Precious Ramabulana was stabbed 52 times after her attacker sneaked through the window of her rented room while she was asleep.\n\nHer alleged attacker, Aubrey Manaka, 28, has not yet pleaded to charges of rape, murder, housebreaking with intent to rob and aggravated robbery.\n\nCommemorations for 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women have done little to stem the bloodshed.\n\nTebogo Setlhare was arrested on November 25 for the murder of his girlfriend, Kgaugelo Tshwae, 28, in Mmakau village in the North West.\n\nHer burnt body was found after she apparently failed to return home from a holiday.\n\nAlso occurring during the 16 days, was the brutal attack on a woman from uMkhuze, allegedly by her husband.\n\nShe lost her arm and also had a cracked skull.\n\nA plastic and reconstructive surgeon said her life would never be the same.\n\nHe added that as a teacher, she \"needs a hand and one of her hands has lost function, but we will try to restore function to that hand. It will take multiple surgeries.\"\n\nWe do not know what 2020 holds, but 2019 has many lessons for South Africa.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["uyinene mrwetyana", "precious ramabulana", "lynette volschenk", "cyril ramaphosa", "leighandre jegels", "meghan cremer", "jesse hess", "johannesburg", "cape town", "polokwane", "port elizabeth", "crime", "rape", "gangs", "shootings", "gang violence", "gender based violence"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 07:21:11 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "From ongoing attacks on women and children, to the apparent targeting of foreign nationals and the deployment of the army to the Cape Flats \u00e2\u0080\u0093 violence grabbed the major headlines in South Africa in 2019.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "../../images/ios/bookapple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"description": "From ongoing attacks on women and children, to the apparent targeting of foreign nationals and the deployment of the army to the Cape Flats \u00e2\u0080\u0093 violence grabbed the major headlines in South Africa in 2019.", "article": {"published_time": "2020/01/01 07:21:11", "modified_time": "2020/01/01 07:21:11", "expiration_time": "2020/01/03 12:22:14"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "url": "https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/from-aminext-to-xenophobia-the-stories-that-rocked-sa-in-2019-20200101", "title": "From #AmINext to xenophobia, the stories that rocked SA in 2019", "site": "News24", "description": "From ongoing attacks on women and children, to the apparent targeting of foreign nationals and the deployment of the army to the Cape Flats \u00e2\u0080\u0093 violence grabbed the major headlines in South Africa in 2019.", "image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9319/ac912a5624e14cd4baf6766314867382.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "News24", "ipad": "News24"}, "id": {"iphone": 310970460, "ipad": 310970460}, "url": {"iphone": "https://itunes.apple.com/za/app/news24/id310970460?mt=8", "ipad": "https://itunes.apple.com/za/app/news24/id310970460?mt=8"}}}, "og": {"site_name": "News24", "title": "From #AmINext to xenophobia, the stories that rocked SA in 2019", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/from-aminext-to-xenophobia-the-stories-that-rocked-sa-in-2019-20200101", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9319/a55684d4a52c4998a2c26d32b74e627f.jpg", "height": 300, "width": 300}, "description": "From ongoing attacks on women and children, to the apparent targeting of foreign nationals and the deployment of the army to the Cape Flats \u00e2\u0080\u0093 violence grabbed the major headlines in South Africa in 2019."}, "fb": {"app_id": 2363277980, "page_id": 10227041841, "pages": 10227041841}, "verify-v1": "7Ni+Om+G5YH4bPtmBOm+5Qih2e8WRykbCvNJXRK9vbg=", "bitly-verification": "267098cc5a65", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "uyinene mrwetyana, precious ramabulana, lynette volschenk, cyril ramaphosa, leighandre jegels, meghan cremer, jesse hess, johannesburg, cape town, polokwane, port elizabeth, crime, rape, gangs, shootings, gang violence, gender based violence", "news_keywords": "uyinene mrwetyana, precious ramabulana, lynette volschenk, cyril ramaphosa, leighandre jegels, meghan cremer, jesse hess, johannesburg, cape town, polokwane, port elizabeth, crime, rape, gangs, shootings, gang violence, gender based violence", "articleid": "92f1e1cc-9dc8-4bef-8953-68a088aec6c7"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/from-aminext-to-xenophobia-the-stories-that-rocked-sa-in-2019-20200101"}
