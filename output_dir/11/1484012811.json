At 23 cents of every health care dollar, drug prices are the primary driver of health costs in the United States. Spending on drugs is expected to rise from $337 billion in 2015 to $560 billion in 2020. For businesses, insurance providers and taxpayers, the result is a health care system that is unsustainably expensive.\n\nIn each of the past five years, approximately 700 drugs, most of which are branded, have increased their prices by 10% or more. The most egregious examples include Evzio, an auto-injector used to treat opioid overdoses, which went up 652% between 2014 and 2017, and Wellbutrin XL, an antidepressant, which went up 596% in that time.\n\nInsulin prices are skyrocketing, too, as exposed in Megan Henry\u2019s Dec. 9 Dispatch article \u201cInsulin cost adds fear to lives of diabetics,\u201d which reported a 99% per person increase in the cost of insulin between 2012 and 2016, leading diabetics to experiment with drug rationing.\n\nLike many readers, I was moved by the experience of Mindi Patterson, who struggles to afford insulin needed for her husband and two sons, all of whom have Type 1 diabetes. Patterson already has lost her sister-in-law, Meaghan Carter, who died two years ago after rationing her insulin; Carter lost her job and her health insurance; as a result, she had to bear the cost of insulin on her own and she, like many other Ohioans, could not afford the $900 per month charged by drug companies for the medicine that would keep her alive.\n\nSadly, I\u2019ve read other stories in the past year about deaths due to rationed insulin. I expect you have too. These are not random tragedies. They are the result of a dynamic in which pharmaceutical companies can charge astronomical amounts for their products simply to increase their own profits.\n\nWhen the pharmaceutical industry raises the prices on these and other drugs, they don\u2019t have to worry about a competitor offering the same product for less. They don\u2019t need to ask for permission, and they don\u2019t have to justify it.\n\nWhy? Companies extend their patent protections \u2014 some multiple times \u2014 in order to ward off competition. By abusing the patent system, drugmakers can maintain monopolies on their products for 20 years or more, arbitrarily raising prices all the while.\n\nThe good news is that state and federal policymakers from across the political spectrum have started to take notice. Many states and even Congress have begun to reform the system and rein in the skyrocketing drug prices set by pharmaceutical companies.\n\nIn Ohio, state Sen. Hearcel Craig of Columbus and state Rep. Beth Liston of Dublin have introduced legislation that would limit a patient\u2019s insurance cost-sharing to $100 for a 30-day supply of insulin. I applaud these lawmakers for tackling this important issue.\n\nThe legislation, however, is incomplete. It is missing a critically important component to ensure Ohioans are fully protected from escalating price of insulin. The bill must also limit the drug manufacturer \u2014 who sets the price \u2014 from actually charging more than $100 for a month\u2019s supply.\n\nInsurance is a reflection of what it costs to purchase health care. Any legislation that deals with insurance costs without addressing the underlying price of that health care is an artificial solution and, in this instance, will actually incentivize drug manufacturers to continue to raise prices without any accountability.\n\nA front-end cap on the actual price of insulin and a back-end cap on the insurance price will ensure that patients are fully protected from unreasonable, life-threatening prices.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry claims its high prices are necessary to pay for research and development of new cures. However, according to the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, 90% of the largest drugmakers spend much more on advertising than they do on R&D.\n\nAddressing drug prices would ensure patients have access to lifesaving treatments. It would ensure individuals have access to affordable health coverage. It would reduce the ever-growing cost of health care in the U.S.\n\nMost importantly, it would save lives. No one should have to choose between paying her bills and accessing the medications she needs.\n\nMiranda Motter is president and CEO of the Ohio Association of Health Plans.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Drug prices are out of control.
