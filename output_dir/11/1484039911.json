Phoenix's skies were cloudy for 50% of November and December, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe Phoenix area saw more rain than usual this November, and it rained on Christmas Day for the first time in a decade.\n\nIsaac Smith, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said multiple weather systems moved through the area this fall and winter, bringing rainfall.\n\n\"That\u2019s definitely brought in a lot of cloud cover,\" he said.\n\nOn average, Phoenix is cloudy about 38% of the time during the last two months of the year.\n\nPhoenix is one of the sunniest cities in the United States, according to NOAA data. The city's average annual percent of sunshine is 85%, just 5% shy of the nation's sunniest city, Yuma.\n\nTucson and Flagstaff also are among the sunniest cities in the country.\n\nSmith said clouds will continue to move out of metro Phoenix on New Year's Eve, bringing clear skies for revelers ringing in 2020.\n\nReach the reporter at Lily.Altavena@ArizonaRepublic.com or follow her on Twitter @LilyAlta.\n\nSupport local journalism.
