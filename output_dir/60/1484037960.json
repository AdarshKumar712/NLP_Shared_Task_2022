This is a program model designed to go one step further in better assisting those who have served our country,\u201d said Sheriff Don Barnes. \u201cThe Sheriff\u2019s Department dedicates much time and resources to build diverse and effective programming for all inmates with the hope that when released from custody, individuals will not recidivate.\u201d\n\nOCSD Correctional Programs has partnered with 10 agencies to provide programming for HUMV, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Tierney Center for Veteran Services, Working Wardrobes and the Orange County Probation Department, among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nMore\n\nEmail\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\nPrint\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nPocket\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Veterans", "Crime", "OC Sheriff"], "authors": ["Art Pedroza", "The Exile"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 21:33:44 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The O.C.
