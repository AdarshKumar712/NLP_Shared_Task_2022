"ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nAt the end of this second decade of the new millennium, it\u2019s natural to draw up our lists indicating our favorite movies, music and draw up our prognostications about what last year\u2019s polls mean about this year\u2019s politics. Yet, strangely and horrifically, the last month of 2019 provides the best overall predictor for what\u2019s ahead in 2020.\n\nThe epidemic of attacks on Jewish people in New York City and the tri-state area is not an acute, unpredictable event, but a horrific outgrowth of Democratic Party and liberal establishment attitudes and policies. The bizarre inability of Democratic leadership to admit their culpability in the spread of anti-Semitism is not surprising.\n\nThe constant effort by the Democrats is focused on reinforcing their preferred narrative, that \u201cwhite supremacism\u201d is the scourge America is facing and President Trump is the leader of that menacing monster.\n\nIt is this narrative that is to take precedence over everything, even if it means serving up a completely bogus explanation of what is happening and why. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, Michigan Democrat, exposed this habitual narrative reaction to an event that transcends partisanship and horrifies every decent person \u2014 the anti-Semitic attack earlier in December on a Jersey City kosher supermarket.\n\n\u201cThis is heartbreaking. White supremacy kills,\u201d Ms. Tlaib declared in the since-deleted tweet. The suspects, in fact, were revealed to be African American, and part of the so-called Black Hebrew Israelites, who subscribe to an extreme anti-Semitism. Even knowing who the attackers were didn\u2019t stop Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, from deflecting and spinning.\n\nErielle Davidson at the Federalist noted, \u201cWhen questioned about the attack on the Jersey City kosher supermarket earlier this month, Mayor de Blasio ignored the motivations of the perpetrators, who belonged to a radical left-wing fringe group known as the Black Hebrew Israelites. Instead, he deflected in a bizarre maneuver, opting to discuss the scourge of white supremacy and private militias.\u201d\n\nJames Higgins, the organizer of \u201cThe Monday Meeting,\u201d the center-right coalition in New York, noted on Twitter, \u201cMight it be that progressive encouragement of \u2018The Squad\u2019 and of BDS is a dog whistle that has sent anti-Semitic hate crimes in New York City up 53% in one year?\u201d Might it, indeed.\n\nThere has been a hate crime against Jews every day in New York since Dec. 23, also the second day of Hanukkah. Any normal person, upon seeing their rhetoric targeting Jewish people manifesting in this manner would sit back in self-reflection, horrified at the result and contemplating how to stop the madness.\n\nBut not the Democrats. Instead, after the machete attack on the rabbi\u2019s house on Dec. 28, the seventh night of Hanukkah, in Monsey, New York, the reaction among many public and leading Democrats was like a template: Yes, they would lament the rise in hate crimes against Jews, but hey, don\u2019t look over here, it\u2019s because of that bad evil orange man in Washington, D.C.\n\nMr. de Blasio sat down for an interview with Fox News\u2019 Ed Henry the day after the Monsey attack. What viewers saw was a master class in the idiotic art of deflection as he blamed the \u201ctone\u201d coming out of Washington, including from the president. Bethany Mandel a contributor to the Washington Examiner, had perhaps the most illuminating response to this disgusting effort:\n\n\u201cThose who reflexively blame President Trump for any and all attacks, no matter how unrelated his administration, actions, or rhetoric are, have made a conscious choice: They would rather play politics than put an end to the violence. And worse, it seems they would like it to continue, in order to have more ammunition against the White House leading up to the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nThe frenzy to gaslight Americans into not believing their own eyes is not limited to the attacks on Jewish people. California Gov. Gavin Newsom continues to try to blame Mr. Trump and the federal government for the continuing collapse of civil society in California. Homelessness, drug use, tent cities, human excrement on the sidewalks and crime now define that previously great state.\n\nMedieval diseases such as typhus, typhoid fever, in addition to outbreaks of hepatitis A and tuberculosis, stalk the people of Los Angeles and San Francisco. Officials have recently issued concern that conditions could invite a return of the plague. It\u2019s all Bad Orange Man\u2019s fault, they tell us. We shake our heads and wonder what it will take for Democrats to admit their policies are failures and destroy people\u2019s lives.\n\nThen there\u2019s Baltimore, where despair, drugs and violence continue to condemn its residents.\n\n\u201cBaltimore could wrap up 2019 with its highest per-capita homicide rate on record as killings of adults and minors alike for drugs, retribution, money or no clear reason continue to add up and city officials appear unable to stop the violence,\u201d The Associated Press reported.\n\nAs National Review put it, \u201cBaltimore, a once-great American city, has all but imploded thanks to decades of corrupt leadership, crime, and the progressive policies now trumpeted by Democratic presidential hopefuls as solutions to the country\u2019s cultural and economic divisions.\u201d\n\nWhether it be New York, California, Baltimore or any other liberal city and state, these realities prove one thing: Policy and leadership matter. So one must ask: Why do the Democrats in these cities continue to deny the truth? Perhaps it\u2019s because the only thing they value is their own power, to be preserved at any cost.\n\nMake no mistake, what we can expect in 2020 is not complicated, it will be more of the Democratic establishment spending all its time and energy convincing you to not believe your lying eyes. The only way these problems will be solved is for Americans to follow the lead of the British by sending an undeniable message in November 2020 rejecting those who promote Jew-hatred and policies that are meant to sow division and chaos.\n\n\u2022 Tammy Bruce, president of Independent Women\u2019s Voice, author and Fox News contributor, is a radio talk-show host.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.
