With J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s men threatening to dominate the coming decade there has never been a better time to be a Kopite. Melwood has been preparing for this coming period of dominance, we believe Curtis Jones will be the breakthrough star of 2020.\n\nJones has been at Anfield since he was a kid, first turning out for the club at under-nine level. He has rocketed through the ranks at Melwood, impressing at every level, often captaining his side.\n\nThe local lad made his first debut in January 2019, starting against Wolves in the FA Cup, he has since collected the man of the match award for his efforts against MK Dons in the League Cup, he scored the winning penalty against Arsenal in the next round.\n\nJones\u2019 Premier League debut came during the Reds\u2019 3-0 win over Bournemouth at the start of December. We can expect more first team minutes for him in the near future.\n\nCurtis Jones will surely be our breakthrough star of 2020 as it is the perfect time for him. The Reds have their strongest squad in modern history, there will be plenty of games where we are leading handsomely enough to bring on one of the youngsters.\n\nAs long as Jones continues to impress during the cameos we can expect him to win a few starts. The intense footballing style of Klopp\u2019s Liverpool demands rotation, we need to keep our players refreshed in order to maintain our high press \u2013 Jones could benefit from this rotation.\n\nOf course, Jones may also benefit from our vast lead at the top of the table, if the Reds were to win the league with time to spare, we may see the gaffer blood some young talent.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Jones", "Curtis Jones"], "authors": ["Brendan Hodrien", "Brendan Hodrien Is A Woolyback Writer", "Born In Birkenhead", "Raised His Dad'S Stories Of Paris", "Wembley", "Rome.
