There should be some room heaters too,\" he said.\n\nWhile some kept themselves warm by lighting bonfires on the sidewalks, dense fog blanketed the city on Wednesday with the night temperature falling to 2.4 degrees Celsius (36.3 degrees Fahrenheit), disrupting road, air and rail traffic.\n\nOn Monday, the Indian capital recorded its coldest December day since 1901, with the maximum temperature plummeting to the lowest ever at 9.4C (48.9F).\n\n\"The maximum temperature also dipped to less than 10 degrees in large parts of northern India,\" Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre in New Delhi told Al Jazeera.\n\nApart from the capital, Indian states and territories that continued to face a severe cold wave included Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.\n\n\"Usually temperature dips in the month of January, but this time mercury has broken the record of decades in December itself,\" Shrivastava added.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Capital New Delhi broke record for coldest December day in 119 years on Monday, compounding miseries of the homeless.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/mritems/assets/images/touch-icon-iphone.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0 maximum-scale=1.0, minimal-ui", "guid": 200101071656861, "title": "In Pictures: India's homeless bear brunt of record cold", "description": "Capital New Delhi broke record for coldest December day in 119 years on Monday, compounding miseries of the homeless.", "og": {"title": "In Pictures: India's homeless bear brunt of record cold", "description": "Capital New Delhi broke record for coldest December day in 119 years on Monday, compounding miseries of the homeless.", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/pictures-india-homeless-bear-brunt-record-cold-200101071656861.html", "internalurl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/pictures-india-homeless-bear-brunt-record-cold-200101071656861.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/1/1/09b9f0b50ebb4a37ab5eab9a2e71537c_18.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 562}}, "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/pictures-india-homeless-bear-brunt-record-cold-200101071656861.html", "ShortURL": "https://aje.io/l9mdr", "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/1/1/09b9f0b50ebb4a37ab5eab9a2e71537c_18.jpg", "twitter": {"title": "In Pictures: India's homeless bear brunt of record cold", "description": "Capital New Delhi broke record for coldest December day in 119 years on Monday, compounding miseries of the homeless.", "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/1/1/09b9f0b50ebb4a37ab5eab9a2e71537c_18.jpg", "account_id": 4970411, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@AJENews"}, "ContentType": "In Pictures", "ContentIndexURL": "/indepth/inpictures/", "google-play-app": "app-id=net.aljazeera.english", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504847776"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/pictures-india-homeless-bear-brunt-record-cold-200101071656861.html"}
