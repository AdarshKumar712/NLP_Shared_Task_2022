' He was able to recall plays from three previous hands. At that point, guys threw their cards down and said, 'Let's do something else.'"</p><p>At Princeton, Ohlendorf wrote his senior thesis on the MLB draft, examining, among other things, the investment and financial return for the top players in the draft.

We'll say, 'Ross, what is the percentage chance of this or that happening?' And he'll say, 'The percentage chance of you winning that game of Pluck [a card game] is 65.678%, not 65.667%."</p><p>Teammates loved him for his smarts.

"We watch the same guys, he picks up things that no one else can. I ask, 'What did you see? I can't see that.'"</p><p>Lovullo is wicked smart and observant, he is a former player, a former coach and currently the manager of the Diamondbacks. He said sign stealing is "alive and well today. Every pitch of every game, a sign is being given. It is the underworld side of the game, and it is understood by everyone in the game. There are a lot of moving parts every night." (The Astros are currently embroiled in a sign-stealing controversy, but unlike Lovullo, they allegedly needed electronic assistance, where Lovullo just uses his eyes.)</p><p>He doesn't mind staring at another man for four hours at a time because, he said, "we are trying to win a pitch, win an inning, win a moment. That can make a difference in a division race. It's all about helping your team gain a competitive advantage. What's happening inside the game is the grease that runs the engine of the game."</p><p>Stealing signs can be difficult. "The [2017] Twins, I couldn't decode what they are doing," Lovullo said. "The teams that are hypersensitive to those things are the teams that are doing it themselves. They are so good at concealing signs because they are so good at stealing signs.
