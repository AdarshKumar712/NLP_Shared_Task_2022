Sussex Inlet man David Warner was among a group of locals who had travelled to Nowra by bus before the Princes Highway was blocked off on Tuesday. 'When we came in, everything was blue, it was all good and then 11 o'clock (there was) all these fires, smoke, sirens everywhere,' Mr Warner told AAP on Wednesday. 'I said, we're not going to get back.' Unlike those who had evacuated to Bomaderry Bowling Club, Mr Warner had nothing with him. He said those running the centre were very nice but 'none of us slept at all'. 'It was shocking,' he said. 'I will never forget this New Year's. 'It'll be stuck in my head 'til the day I die.' Near people and their pets - including dogs, cats and a tortoise - he watched Sydney's famous foreshore fireworks on a giant projection screen hanging at the front of the room as sausage sandwiches were served. 'I forgot it was New Year's actually because of all of what was going on,' Mr Warner said. Reality hit home on Wednesday as information from Sussex Inlet began filtering through the evacuation centre. The body of a yet-to-be-identified man was found about midday in a vehicle on Wandra Road. Sussex Inlet was a community where 'everyone knows everyone', Mr Warner said. 'I'm a bit upset about it because I don't know who it is, and we know a lot of people in Sussex,' he said. Crews on Wednesday built containment lines around the massive Currowan fire that impacted Sussex Inlet and other towns over a 100km stretch of the coast. A watch-and-act alert advises communities to monitor conditions, beware of falling trees and seek shelter as the firefront approaches.

Mick Roberts had not made contact with family for more than 24 hours and on Wednesday his niece Leah Parson confirmed he had been found dead at his Buchan home. 'He's not missing anymore,' Ms Parsons wrote on the East Gippsland fire season 2019-2020 Facebook page. 'His body has been found in his house..very sad day for us to srart (sic) the year but we're a bloody tight family and we will never forget our mate and my beautiful Uncle Mick.' Victoria Police said a person had been found dead in Buchan, but the cause of his death has not yet been confirmed. Earlier on Wednesday Premier Daniel Andrews said four people were still missing, but would not say what communities in East Gippsland the people belonged to. 'Everything is being done to try and establish the whereabouts of these people,' he told reporters at the Bairnsdale incident control centre. Mr Andrews lamented reports of Mr Roberts' death. 'It is of course the worst of all news, the notion that someone has lost their life,' he told ABC Gippsland. After spending more than a day on emergency alert, the bushfire threat in East Gippsland and at Corryong in northeast Victoria was downgraded to watch and acts. More than 500,000 hectares have been burnt, after three fires in East Gippsland combined on Tuesday. The blaze at Corryong has burnt at least 109,000 hectares. The total area burnt has exceeded that of the Black Saturday bushfires of February 2009. There were more than 40 fires still burning across Victoria at 9:30pm on Wednesday with 11 at the watch and act level. The risk of flare-ups elsewhere remains. Conditions are expected to worsen on Saturday and dry lightning has continued to spark new fires. Mr Andrews spent Wednesday in East Gippsland where he said emotions were running high. 'I spoke with people today and they just said it was hurricane-like, horrifying, terrifying, the most frightening experience of their life.' 'The next few days are going to be a lot of hard work and the next few months will be a very long and steady process of helping these communities to rebuild,' the premier said. So far, confirmed property losses are 24 structures at Buchan, 19 at Sarsfield, 10 at Mallacoota and up to 15 at Cudgewa. Power has been cut to more than 7000 properties at East Gippsland and more than 1800 in the northeast. AusNet said it could take days to restore power because it was unsafe to attend and assess the extent of damage. Phones remain cut across much of the region and people are struggling to communicate with loved ones and get the latest information on the fire risk. A boil water notice was put in place for Mallacoota, an isolated coastal holiday town near the NSW border, from Tuesday to reduce public health risks. A NSW police boat brought in water to Mallacoota on Tuesday and a Victoria water police boat is taking 1.6 tonnes of water on Wednesday. A barge from Melbourne with two weeks' supply of food, water and fuel is also making its way to the town. After a request from the premier on Tuesday, military personnel have begun helping with the relief effort, including undertaking rapid damage assessments. Aircraft including Black Hawk helicopters are expected to land in the east of the state on Wednesday with other aircraft and naval vessels due in coming days to move people out of the area. Naval vessels including HMAS Choules left Sydney bound for the East Gippsland coast on Tuesday evening and training vessel MV Sycamore has also been deployed. Advertisement\n\nThis bushfire season NSW has lost more than 1,000 homes have been razed and entire towns, including Mogo and Cobargo have been destroyed.\n\nAt least 110 fires are still burning across New South Wales, with seven burning at a watch and act warning level.

The recent deaths include dairy farmer Patrick Salway, 29, and his father Robert, 63, who died trying to save their property in Cobargo, near Bega. A 70-year-old man was found dead outside a home at Yatte Yattah, west of Lake Conjola, on Tuesday night, while another man's body was found in a burnt vehicle on a road off the Princes Highway at Yatte Yattah Wednesday morning. The body of a man was found in a vehicle on Wandra Road at Sussex Inlet about 11.30am Wednesday but is yet to be formally identified, while a seventh body was found outside a home Coolagolite, about 10km east of Cobargo, on Wednesday. Beloved great-grandfather Mick Roberts, 67, from Buchan, in East Gippsland, was found dead at his home on Wednesday morning. On Sunday, young father and volunteer firefighter Samuel McPaul, 28, was fighting a blaze in Jingellic, in Green Valley, about 70km east of Albury on the border of NSW and Victoria, when the truck he was in rolled, killing him instantly. Two other firefighters died on December 19 after a tree fell on their truck while they were travelling through Buxton, south of Sydney. Andrew O'Dwyer, 36, and Geoffrey Keaton, 32, were later named as the volunteers involved in the tragic accident the following day. Both men were young fathers and had volunteered with the Horsley Park Rural Fire Service brigade for more than a decade. Two people also died in South Australian fires before Christmas, including 69-year-old engineer Ron Selth. His body was found in his Charleston home, which was destroyed by the Cudlee Creek blaze on December 21. Another person died in a fiery car crash on the same day. In early November, just weeks into the horror fire season which has been baring down on the nation for months, three people perished in northern NSW. George Nole's body was found in a burnt out car near his home in Glen Innes while 63-year-old Julie Fletcher's body was pulled from a scorched building in Johns River, north of Taree. Vivian Chaplain, a 69-year-old woman from Wytaliba, succumbed to her injuries in hospital after attempting in vain to save her home and animals from the blaze. The fourth victim was named just days later as 58-year-old Barry Parsons. His body was discovered in bushland on the southern end of the Kyuna Track at Willawarrin, near Kempsey, on November 13. 77-year-old Bob Lindsey and 68-year-old Gwen Hyde were found in their burned out property on October 9th.
