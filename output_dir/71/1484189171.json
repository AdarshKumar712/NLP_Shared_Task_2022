If Sokol\u2019s name sounds familiar, that\u2019s because he played tight end at Michigan State University for four seasons.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 tight end went undrafted and has yet to make his NFL debut, but bounced around on the Chargers and Jaguars\u2019 practice squads this season. He caught 31 passes for 348 yards and two touchdowns while in East Lansing.\n\nBodine has some experience under his belt as a former fourth-round pick of the Cincinnati Bengals back in 2014. The center started all 16 games for the first four seasons of his career for Cincinnati, but was limited to 10 in Buffalo in 2018 and did not appear in one this year. He was last seen with the New England Patriots after the team traded a sixth-round pick for his services, but he was cut shortly after in September.\n\nPro Football Focus graded Bodine at 61.6 overall, 74.6 in pass protection and 56.0 on the ground in 2018 while with the Bills. His 588 snaps played that year represented a career low.\n\nRelated: Lions sign 11 players to futures contract, including long snapper\n\nAs for Butler, the 6-foot-6 tight end has spent some time with Oakland\u2019s practice squad but has not appeared in a regular-season game. He\u2019s played in eight preseason contests for the Raiders over the past two seasons, catching eight passes for 83 yards.\n\nThese three join the list of 11 announced on Monday, which was mainly Detroit\u2019s practice squad outside of quarterback Joe Callahan. The list included receivers Victor Bolden, Jonathan Duhart, Tom Kennedy, and safety A.J. Howard, defensive tackle Olive Sagapolu, linebacker Christian Sam and guard Casey Tucker.\n\nThe Lions signed punters Jack Fox and Matt Wile as Sam Martin is eligible to test free agency come March. Detroit also added former North Dakota State long snapper James Fisher to a futures deal.\n\nRelated: All 17 Lions players eligible to become unrestricted free agents, ranked\n\nDon Muhlbach has started all 160 games at long snapper for the Lions in the last decade and has played 244 games for the franchise. He\u2019s 56th all-time on the NFL\u2019s games played list and remains a more than capable snapper at this stage of his career.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Michigan\u2019s Best Day", "Flavor"], "authors": ["Benjamin Raven", "Braven Mlive.Com"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 18:45:57 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/pf/resources/images/mlive/favicon.ico?d=139", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435, "app_id": 132720883409479}, "title": "Detroit Lions sign 3 more players to futures contracts, including former Michigan State TE", "og": {"title": "Detroit Lions sign 3 more players to futures contracts, including former Michigan State TE", "url": "https://www.mlive.com/lions/2019/12/detroit-lions-sign-3-more-players-to-futures-contracts-including-former-michigan-state-te.html", "site_name": "mlive", "type": "article", "description": "Detroit added 11 players to futures deals to start the week, and then signed center Russell Bodine, and tight ends Paul Butler and Matt Sokol on Tuesday.
