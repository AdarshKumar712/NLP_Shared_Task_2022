He spoke to the media after a meeting of the cabinet committee on government purchase at the Secretariat in Dhaka on Wednesday.\n\nThe banks had been scheduled to implement new lending rate ceiling for the manufacturing sector at 9 percent and deposit interest rate ceiling at 6 percent from the first day of the year.\n\nBut after a meeting on Monday night, the finance minister said the new rates will be effective for all sectors bar credit cards from Apr 1.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kamal said they changed the decision on the sectors following instructions from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nThe new date to implement the new rates was set following a request from the bankers who sought time so that some of both short-term and long-term deposits with more than 6 percent interests can mature, according to the finance minister.\n\nSpeaking about deposit interest rates, he said, \u201cIf the deposit interest rate is fixed at 6 percent for all banks, everyone will keep money in the government banks. So, we are keeping a 0.5 percentage point gap between the interest rates of the government and private banks.\u201d\n\nHe said the bankers must cooperate to implement the new rates now as they will not face any loss by receiving 9 percent interest on loans after giving maximum 6 percent interest on deposits.\n\n\u201cThe government is stricter than before because they [bankers] had not done it [follow government call for lowering lending rates] previously,\u201d Kamal said.\n\n\u201cSo, we will wait this time, but (they) must implement the rates,\u201d he added.\n\nThe new rates will bolster industrialisation and trade besides cutting default loans, the minister believes.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Lending rate", "deposit interest rate", "Bangladesh Bank", "finance minister", "AHM Mustafa Kamal"], "tags": ["Cricket", "Corruption", "Achievement", "1971", "CHT", "Agriculture", "Democracy", "Culture"], "authors": ["Senior Correspondent"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Private banks can offer 6% interest on deposit, finance minister says", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"og": {"url": "https://bdnews24.com/economy/2020/01/01/private-banks-can-offer-6-interest-on-deposit-finance-minister-says", "title": "Private banks can offer 6% interest on deposit, finance minister says", "description": "The authorities will fix a higher ceiling of deposit interest rates for private banks than that for NCBs so that customers do not lean towards the state-owned banks, AHM Mustafa Kamal has said.", "image": "https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2020/01/01/mustafa-kamal-010120-01.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/mustafa-kamal-010120-01.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Private banks can offer 6% interest on deposit, finance minister says", "sectionname": "economy", "articleid": 1707408, "sponsoredArticle": "false", "keywords": "Lending rate, deposit interest rate, Bangladesh Bank, finance minister, AHM Mustafa Kamal"}, "canonical_link": "https://bdnews24.com/economy/2020/01/01/private-banks-can-offer-6-interest-on-deposit-finance-minister-says"}
