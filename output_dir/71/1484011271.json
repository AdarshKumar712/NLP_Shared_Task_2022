That, in turn, could crimp revenue for the advertising-based business which rely on those startups.\n\nThe report underscores the interconnectedness of the modern tech sector, and how events in one corner can ripple out and affect the broader market in unpredictable ways.\n\nTo make its case, BofA analysts took six major startups that IPO'd in 2019 \u2014 ride-hailing firms Uber and Lyft, social network Pinterest, fashion company RealReal, fitness company Peloton, and pet food retailer Chewy \u2014 and looked at their ad spend as a percentage of their total revenue.\n\nOn average, this dropped over the last 12 months \u2014 from 28% in 2018 to 24% expected for 2019. The financial services firm anticipates it'll drop again next year, down to 22% in 2020.\n\n\"If this deceleration in ad spend is reflective of start-up sector,\" the analysts wrote, \"Facebook and Google could see an unanticipated slowdown in ad spend in 2020.\"\n\nOf course, that's not guaranteed. The six startups identified may not be truly representative of the broader ecosystem, and the disappointing IPO results that the industry did see in 2019 may not be repeated in 2020.\n\nBofA also doesn't attempt to precisely quantify the size of the hit Google and Facebook will take, but it will by no means be ruinous. All six companies are modeled to continue to grow their total sales and marketing spend year-on-year from now through the end of 2021, albeit at successively slower rates.\n\nBut what it does mean is that an easy growth engine for the advertising giants is at the risk of drying up \u2014 an unanticipated complication that may frustrate investors' insatiable hunger for growth, and force Facebook and Google to think harder about future sources of revenue.\n\nIt would not be the first time that trouble with startups affected more established tech companies that had become reliant on the free-spending startup customers. During the dotcom boom two decades ago, Oracle and SAP saw business boom as a wave of young startups snapped up their products in a frenzied race to build websites. When those startups' businesses proved unviable and the startups failed, the big tech companies lost an important source of revenue and were forced to readjust their own operations.\n\nGot a tip?
