The incident is said to have occurred on December 28 when Kushagra Sharma checked into the hotel along with his wife.\"My wife had placed a 50gm gold chain with two lockets and a rudraksha chain with three lockets on the bedside. While heading to dinner around 9.30pm, I noticed she wasn't wearing the chains. She went near the bed to collect them and was shocked to see them missing. We immediately informed the hotel management and with their help, carefully searched the room again, but in vain. We suspect housekeeping staff may have stolen them,\" read the complaint.Police said they have questioned the housekeeping staff. \"We were busy with New Year security duties.
