\u2014 All of the gloom and doom that many in the Jewish community have felt toward the end of this decade should not obscure the fact that the 2010s were full of innovation. Yes, there was an alarming rise in anti-Semitism across the U.S. and the world, which culminated in several violent attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions. But that didn\u2019t stop the community from growing, evolving and adapting to modern life.\n\nHere\u2019s a look back at 10 huge developments from the past 10 years that have changed the makeup and lifestyles of Jewish Americans.\n\nTechnology puts Judaism in everyone\u2019s pocket\n\nWith the advent of the smartphone, we modern folks have grown accustomed to having any piece of information available anywhere, anytime, at the push of a button. But it wasn\u2019t until the launch of Sefaria in 2011 that this was true of Jewish texts.\n\nIn a stroke, Sefaria put thousands of years of Jewish literature in everybody\u2019s pocket. The Bible, the Talmud, medieval Jewish philosophers and commentators, the classic Jewish legal codes \u2014 all of it available in Hebrew (and often English, too) and completely searchable. Seemingly overnight, the site became an invaluable resource for Jewish learning. And much like Google and Facebook before it, Sefaria made many people wonder how they had ever lived without it.\n\nThe site also helped democratize Jewish study \u2014 not only by making English translations of canonical texts instantly available anywhere, but by making it possible for anyone to create source sheets that gathered sacred texts on a given topic and share them with the world. The site currently hosts thousands of such sheets on topics as diverse as Jewish business ethics, discrimination, civil rights, hunger and environmentalism.\n\nSefaria is not the only example of technology being harnessed to broaden the Jewish tent. Synagogues now stream services for free online and Jewish educational websites bring a bottomless wealth of Jewish information to the far-flung masses. But it may be the most ambitious of the lot.\n\n\u2014 Ben Harris\n\nA new kosher cheeseburger becomes possible\n\nThe 2010s have seen the emergence of plant-based products that taste eerily like burgers but do not contain an iota of meat. Their purveyors \u2014 Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat chief among them \u2014 hope to launch a vegetarian revolution that will take down America\u2019s massive factory farming industry. Impossible says that the protein heme gives their offerings the juicy, meaty quality missing from previous veggie burger attempts.\n\nFor Jews, the new meatless burgers have meant that dishes once Jewishly verboten have finally become accessible. Observant Jews can slap a slice of cheddar on an Impossible burger and enjoy a 100 percent kosher cheeseburger. At Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, patrons can have an egg with Beyond Bacon.\n\nFor kosher-keeping Jews, trying to imitate forbidden foods is a tradition as old as time. Meatless burgers have ushered in a new era of that struggle. For while the rabbis of the Talmud outlawed the eating of milk and meat together, they said nothing about milk and heme.\n\n\u2014 Ben Sales\n\nFemale Orthodox clergy make their mark\n\nWhen the decade began, there were almost no American Orthodox clergywomen. When it ended, there were 33.\n\nThe 2010s saw a revolution in the Modern Orthodox world, as a seminary for Orthodox women, Yeshivat Maharat, turned out ordained graduates year after year starting in 2013. The last graduating class was the largest with eight members.\n\nThe graduates \u2014 some of whom take on variations of the title \u201crabbi\u201d \u2014 have made a splash. Nine work in synagogues, many in pulpit positions. The others work in leadership roles throughout the Jewish world. They\u2019ve also sparked a backlash, with two umbrella Orthodox groups \u2014 the Orthodox Union and the Rabbinical Council of America \u2014 issuing bans on female clergy.\n\nBut the bans have not stopped the growing ranks of American Orthodox women receiving ordination, joining the ranks of Conservative and Reform women who have been rabbis for decades. Just months before the decade ended, a graduate of Yeshivat Maharat founded the first-ever American Orthodox synagogue led by a woman.\n\n\u2014 Ben Sales\n\nDomestic anti-Semitism is back\n\nIn 2013, the Anti-Defamation League reported the lowest levels of anti-Semitism since it started tracking the phenomenon in 1979. By 2018, the trend had fully reversed: There were 1,879 anti-Semitic incidents, the third-highest total ever recorded by the ADL. The incidents included the killing by a white nationalist of 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh \u2014 the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history.\n\nNot even a year later, on April 27, 2019, a woman was killed and three others were injured at a Chabad synagogue in Poway, California. And on Dec. 10, four people were killed in an attack that ended at a kosher supermarket in Jersey City, New Jersey. On Dec. 29, a man entered a rabbi\u2019s house in Monsey, New York, with a machete and stabbed five people.\n\nThe spike included a dramatic increase in attacks on predominantly Hasidic men in Brooklyn, who are more easily targeted by would-be assailants than other Jews because of their distinctive dress. Jewish Americans are afraid of this becoming the new normal: Some 31 percent of respondents to a recent survey by the American Jewish Committee agreed that they \u201cavoided publicly wearing, carrying, or displaying things that might help people identify you as a Jew,\u201d and 25 percent \u201cavoid certain places, events, or situations out of concern for your safety or comfort as a Jew.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Laura E. Adkins\n\nThe Pew study counts American Jews\n\nThe Jewish organizational world was rocked in 2013 by the release of a study by the Pew Research Center on American Jewish demographics. The study counted how many of us there were, whether we were marrying other Jews, what denominations we identified with and how we observed Jewish ritual. It found that that the rate of intermarriage was sharply rising, the number of Conservative Jews was falling and nearly a third of Jews were unaffiliated.\n\nSince its publication, the study has been used by Jewish journalists, activists and leaders to guide their decisions and justify their opinions. It has also helped push Jewish organizations to shift from trying to prevent intermarriage to trying to engage interfaith families.\n\nThe study additionally found that many define their Judaism around remembering the Holocaust, leading an ethical life and working toward justice. It showed that most Jewish Americans feel some attachment to Israel. And it found that nearly all Jewish Americans \u2014 94 percent \u2014 are proud to be Jewish.\n\n\u2014 Ben Sales\n\nThe rise of Jewy and Israeli TV\n\nJews have long found success in Hollywood, and for decades television has been fertile ground for Jewish cultural references (see: Seinfeld, Jerry). But the 2010s saw the rise of a number of celebrated television shows and movies that are either explicitly centered on Jewish themes or imported directly from the Jewish state.\n\nThe Golden Age of Streaming brought a deluge of parochially Jewish shows that still found a mass audience: \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d which won a raft of awards portraying a Jewish 1950s housewife turned comedian; \u201cBroad City,\u201d the comedy about two Jewish millennial women in Brooklyn; \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend,\u201d in which protagonist Rebecca Bunch engages in a \u201cJAP Battle\u201d; and \u201cTransparent,\u201d about a Jewish family in Los Angeles struggling with gender identity and which filmed a season mostly in Israel.\n\nWhile \u201cTransparent\u201d went to Israel, a number of Israeli shows came to the U.S. Americans binge-watched \u201cSrugim,\u201d about Modern Orthodox singles in Jerusalem; \u201cShtisel,\u201d about ultra-Orthodox singles (and marrieds) in Jerusalem; \u201cOur Boys,\u201d about the murders of children in and around Jerusalem; and \u201cFauda,\u201d about Israeli commandos in the West Bank. There were also a bunch of forgettable movie dramas about Israel, at least three of them starring Ben Kingsley.\n\nAll of it added up to viewers across America watching and enjoying a range of Jewish characters, foibles and stories.\n\n\u2014 Ben Sales\n\nHaredi women have their say\n\nOn Dec. 22, 2016, Rachel \u201cRuchie\u201d Freier was sworn in as a civil court judge in Kings County, New York: She was the first Hasidic woman ever elected to public office in the United States.\n\nUnlike some other segments of the wider Orthodox world, Hasidic Jews largely reject engagement with the secular world unless necessary. Both men and women follow restrictive dress codes, and women in particular are not encouraged to hold public leadership positions.\n\nRaised in a Hasidic enclave in Brooklyn, Freier in recent years has become a symbol of female Orthodox women who want to assume more public roles without compromising traditional values or severing ties to their cloistered communities. In 2011, Freier founded an all-female volunteer EMT service, Ezras Nashim, after the Jewish EMT service Hatzolah refused to allow women to serve. The group\u2019s fight for an ambulance has become politicized and their full acceptance in the ultra-Orthodox world is a long way off, but there\u2019s little question that Freier and women like her have carved out space for haredi women to take on positions of greater influence and visibility in their communities.\n\n\u2014 Laura E. Adkins\n\nThe Passover kitniyot revolution comes to America\n\nThe year 2016 saw an important if obscure change in American Jewish life: The Conservative movement officially declared kitniyot, or legumes, acceptable for Ashkenazi Jews to eat on Passover.\n\nThe ruling gave an imprimatur to what already was a quiet revolution taking place in a growing number of liberal observant homes. For centuries, traditional Ashkenazi Jews have abstained from peanuts, beans, rice, lentils, chickpeas and other foods that, according to the rabbis, could be misconstrued as hametz, or leavened food that is anathema on the holiday.\n\nAccording to Sephardic Jewish practice, those foods have always been fine to eat on Passover. In Israel, where most Jews are of Sephardi heritage, kitniyot are widely available on Passover. A significant portion of Israeli Ashkenazim eat them even as they observe the holiday\u2019s other dietary laws. Many Israeli families are mixed Ashkenazi-Sephardi, blurring the lines even further.\n\nThe past decade has seen the Israeli kitniyot trend cross over to America, as parts of America\u2019s largely Ashkenazic Jewish population adopted the Sephardic custom. With a major Jewish movement approving the practice, the stacks of hummus on kosher-for-Passover grocery store shelves could grow.\n\n\u2014 Ben Sales\n\nSpain and Portugal invite their expelled Jews home\n\nIn 2015, Spain and Portugal offered citizenship to descendants of Sephardic Jews who had been persecuted and expelled more than 500 years before. The laws were intended as atonement for the historic wrong of the Inquisition, which destroyed one of the most accomplished Jewish communities in the world. At a time of rising anti-Semitism around the world, the laws were cheered by Jewish leaders.\n\n\u201cSpain is roots, beloved and painful memories,\u201d Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said in a 2017 visit, adding that it\u2019s \u201cnot just nostalgia but an actual home: a place where Jews need not be told to feel at home.\u201d\n\nIn practice, the application process was anything but simple. Spain\u2019s law, whose window for applications ended in October, required applicants demonstrate an affinity with Spanish culture and have their family trees vetted. In Portugal, where the law is open ended, one of the two Jewish communities that the government tasked with vetting applications approves only people who are currently Jewish.\n\nDespite millions of potential applicants, the laws resulted in only about 132,000 applications in Spain and another 50,000 in Portugal. The low response owes to multiple factors.\n\nMost Sephardim live in affluent economies, which may limit their appetite for a second citizenship. Non-Jewish descendants of Sephardim often have no proof of their lineage. About 50,000 citizenship applications have been approved, two-thirds of them by Spain.\n\n\u2014 Cnaan Liphshiz\n\nJews of color gain greater exposure\n\nJews of color have long pushed the wider community to better acknowledge its racial and ethnic and diversity, but a number of high-profile Jews of color made that fact much harder to ignore in the 2010s.\n\nIn 2014, Angela Buchdahl became one of the most prominent Jews of color in the world when she was named senior rabbi of Central Synagogue in New York, one of the largest synagogues in the country. The daughter of a Buddhist mother and Jewish-American father, Buchdahl was born in Korea and became the first Asian-American rabbi in 2001 when she was ordained by the Reform movement\u2019s Hebrew Union College.\n\nShe was far from alone in drawing public attention to Jewish diversity.\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s election in 2008 helped raise the profile of Rabbi Capers Funnye, an African-American rabbi in Chicago who also happened to be first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s cousin. Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, the former NBA star who told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in 2013 that he believed he had \u201cHebrew\u201d roots, would eventually convert to Judaism and play in Israel. Tiffany Haddish, the actress and comedian who only learned at 27 that her father was an Eritrean Jew, threw herself a star-studded bat-mitzvah at age 40 presided over by Sarah Silverman\u2019s sister, Rabbi Susan Silverman.\n\nIn 2019, the American Sephardi Federation and the Morocco-based Association Mimouna hosted the first conference focusing on Jews in Africa that was not exclusively for academics \u2014 a step Funnye said represented a major step forward.\n\n\u201cIt means a great deal to the African-American Jewish community [and] the Jewish community of West Africa because we\u2019ve been a long time in saying we\u2019re here,\u201d Funnye told JTA.\n\n\u2014 Ben Harris", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["David Suissa", "Dan Schnur", "Eva Robbins", "Rachel Fish", "Lorelei Laird", "Debra Nussbaum Cohen", "Daniel Greenfield", "Natalie Solomon", "Shmuel Rosner", "Sharla Etkin-Ives"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 18:00:32 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "NEW YORK (JTA) \u2014 All of the gloom and doom that many in the Jewish community have felt toward the end of this decade should not obscure the fact that the", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://jewishjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-jjlogo6214_512-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 1376757982393206}, "author": "BY <a href='https://jewishjournal.com/author/'></a>", "description": "NEW YORK (JTA) \u2014 All of the gloom and doom that many in the Jewish community have felt toward the end of this decade should not obscure the fact that the", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "10 Ways American Jewish Life Changed in the 2010s | Jewish Journal", "description": "NEW YORK (JTA) \u2014 All of the gloom and doom that many in the Jewish community have felt toward the end of this decade should not obscure the fact that the", "url": "https://jewishjournal.com/online/309009/10-ways-american-jewish-life-changed-in-the-2010s/", "site_name": "Jewish Journal", "updated_time": "2019-12-31T16:27:32+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://jewishjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12-17-19-maharat-1024x683.jpg", "secure_url": "https://jewishjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12-17-19-maharat-1024x683.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 683}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/JewishJournal/", "section": "Online", "published_time": "2019-12-31T18:00:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-12-31T16:27:32+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "NEW YORK (JTA) \u2014 All of the gloom and doom that many in the Jewish community have felt toward the end of this decade should not obscure the fact that the", "title": "10 Ways American Jewish Life Changed in the 2010s | Jewish Journal", "site": "@JewishJournal", "image": "https://jewishjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12-17-19-maharat.jpg", "creator": "@JewishJournal"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://jewishjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-jjlogo6214_512-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://jewishjournal.com/online/309009/10-ways-american-jewish-life-changed-in-the-2010s/"}
