Now almost Xiaomi is in agreement to have it. Xiaomi may launch its mobile phones with NavIC chipsets,\" the ISRO official said.\n\nNavIC is the abbreviation of Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS).\n\nAccording to the ISRO, the IRNSS was developed for terrestrial, aerial and marine navigation, disaster management, vehicle tracking and fleet management and integration with mobile phones.\n\nIt would provide Standard positioning Service (SPS) to all users and Restricted Service (RS), which is an encrypted service for only authorised users.\n\nThe IRNSS is expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 20 metre in the primary service area.\n\nThe ISRO official said the international body 3GPP has formally approved usage of NavIC, allowing the ISRO to collaborate with Qualcom.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Satellite navigation systems", "Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System", "Space programme of India", "Global Positioning System", "Telecommunications", "Economy of China", "Companies", "Xiaomi", "Smartphones", "Navigation", "Draft:Xiaomi Mi 5", "Satellite navigation", "Indian"], "tags": ["Technology Internet"], "authors": ["Press Trust Of India"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Read more about ISRO, Xiaomi in advanced talks over NaVIC chipsets on Business Standard.
