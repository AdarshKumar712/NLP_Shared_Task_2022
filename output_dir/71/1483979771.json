The image of Francis slapping his way free from the clutches of the admirer was an instant hit on social media.\n\nA personal apology followed.\n\n\"We lose patience many times,\" Francis confessed.\n\n\"It happens to me too. I apologise for the bad example given yesterday,\" the head of the Catholic church said before celebrating Mass at the Vatican.\n\nTwitter enthusiasts commented with abandon on the pontiff's prompt riposte to the woman.\n\nFrancis had greeted children before the Nativity scene on Saint Peter's square and was turning away when the woman who had crossed herself then cried out something, pulled on his hand and almost caused him to fall.\n\nThe 83-year-old pope grimaced before managing to break free by slapping her hand twice.\n\nHe continued his tour, walking with some difficulty while maintaining a slightly greater distance from visitors, and gradually relaxed again as he came into contact with other children.\n\nTwitter comments were mostly supportive of the pontiff's instinctive reaction.\n\n\"HE IS HUMAN..
