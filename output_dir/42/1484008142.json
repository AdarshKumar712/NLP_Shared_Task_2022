But life is extremely chaotic, so this year I've decided to set far more realistic goals. Instead of setting out to do one huge thing in the new year, not getting around to it, and feeling like you've failed yourself, try making some extremely simple resolutions that'll still make you feel great.\n\nIf you're searching for the perfect resolution, here are 20 totally doable ones to consider. Most of our suggestions can even be completed in a single day, so you could probably go full-on overachiever and tackle all 20 with ease.\n\n1. Watch a good movie\n\nImage: sony pictures\n\nThere are a whole lot of movies in the world, and they're definitely not all worth your time. Instead of blindly choosing at the box office or playing a game of streaming roulette, do some research to ensure you treat yourself to a movie that people actually like. Give an award-nominated film a try or check out Rotten Tomatoes' guide of the Top 100 Movies of All Time and our list of best 2019 movies for suggestions.\n\n2. Drink more water\n\nIt is \u2014 and I can't stress this enough \u2014 super important to hydrate! Unfortunately, drinking enough water is easy to forget. Trust me. Occasionally I make it to 2:00 p.m. and realize I haven't had a single sip. But if you make an honest effort to drink more water, as I recently did, it becomes easier and easier. If you haven't already, try investing in a reusable water bottle. Filling those things up throughout the day is a blast. Feels great.\n\n3. Use your phone less\n\nSetting limits on how many hours you use your phone is tricky, because the need to text, tweet, or be plugged in varies each day. If you want to use your phone less, try cutting down on scrolling social media right before bed or checking it right when you wake up.\n\nSEE ALSO: Everything coming to Hulu in January 2020\n\n4. Read one book a month\n\nReading more is a common resolution, but you don't have to go HAM and set a 50-book minimum. Set out to read at least one non-online article every month. It can be a novel, a comic book, a full magazine, whatever! If you want to read more, that's great. Anything else will be a bonus.\n\n5. Watch the pilot of a TV show or two that you've been meaning to see\n\nImage: apple tv+\n\nThere are an overwhelming amount of TV shows in the world today, so it's hard to keep up with the latest and greatest. If you have very little free time your television queue is likely dangerously large, so in the new year make some time to sit down, relax, and watch a pilot or two of shows you've been meaning to get around to. The pilot will give you a good feel for whether the show's for you, and if it's not you can cross it off your list and tackle another one.\n\n6. Listen to songs and artists you've never heard before\n\nAt some point during the past few years I started listening to my favorite songs, albums, and artists on a loop, and just kind of tuning everything else out. It's good to listen to things you know you like, but there's a whole world of great music out there, so be sure to set aside some time to give artists and songs you've never heard a chance. Same goes for new podcasts.\n\n7. Dance and/or sing\n\nThis resolution has no real stakes, I just think it's fun as hell to dance and sing as often as possible. Whether you go out to dance with friends and book a karaoke room, or prance around your living room to a record and belt a Lizzo song in the car, have some freaking fun.\n\n8. Sit up straight\n\nAh, good posture, one of the things I forget about more than drinking water. It's so easy to slouch, but it's also easy to check in with yourself every day and re-adjust how you're sitting or standing. If you really want to commit to this one, you can even set an alarm on your phone to remind yourself to straighten up.\n\n9. Stretch more\n\nWhile we're here talking about taking better care of our bodies, consider stretching more frequently in the new year. Take a break at work and do some nice neck rolls every once in a while. When watching TV at night sit on the floor and reach for those toes. You can do it!\n\n10. Try to live more sustainably\n\nImage: eleonora galli / Getty Images\n\nYou don't have to go full zero waste all at once, but adopting a more sustainable lifestyle can be as easy as cutting out plastic bags and straws, or reusing bottles. Here are some great tips if you're looking for guidance.\n\n11. Go for inbox zero\n\nTo some people I'm sure inbox zero seems like a sheer impossibility, but I promise, if you take a few minutes (or hours depending on how drastic the email count is) and set your mind to clearing that inbox, it can be done.\n\n13. Take more walks\n\nGo outside and take more leisurely strolls next year! Take walks on your lunch break, after dinner, with friends, up stairs, or around shopping centers. This one's super simple.\n\n14. Moisturize\n\nMoisturizing your skin? Another super forgettable thing you should be doing on a regular basis. Lotion up, apply that lip balm, and get a humidifier if you have to. Your skin will thank you.\n\n15. Check the batteries in your smoke alarm\n\nImage: DIANE BONDAREFF / INVISION FOR DURACELL / AP IMAGES\n\nReplacing the batteries in your smoke alarm only takes minutes, but it's easier to forget than both checking your posture and hydrating. Check. Those. Batteries. Do it for Jack Pearson.\n\n16. Make your bed in the mornings\n\nAllow Mashable Culture Reporter Morgan Sung to make the case for making your bed every morning. It's a good one.\n\n17. Cook one new thing\n\nAnd culture reporter Chloe Bryan will convince you to cook a single new thing in the new year. We have faith in you.\n\n18. Ask for things you actually want\n\nIt's hard to lose sight of what you *really* want when you feel pressure to please other people and make \"good\" choices, but the new year is the perfect time for you to start putting yourself first. Feel like ordering dessert when no one else is? Ask for it. Don't like the movie your friend picked? Say so. Do, as they say, you.\n\n19. Spend a day offline\n\nOne day. You can do it. No Twitter, no Instagram, no Slack, no reading articles. Live your best offline life.\n\n20. Vote\n\nImage: JUJ WINN / GETTY IMAGES\n\nWe've got an election in 2020, and it's extremely easy and important for you to vote. If you make sure you're registered and vote, you've technically checked off two goals! Astounding.\n\nHappy 2020, everyone!
