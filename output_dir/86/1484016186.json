We even took their caution statements,\u201d he said.\n\nMwapasa has however said he would not shield any police officer implicated in the matter.\n\nHe said the first report by the police on the Msundwe rapes is over and would be released in two weeks\u2019 time.\n\nThe alleged sexual assaults were outlined in a 62-page report released by Malawi\u2019s Ombudsman Martha Chizuma and Law Commissioner Rosemary Kanyuka.\n\nThe MHRC report says the police assaults occurred in the homes of victims and were carried out in revenge for the stoning death of a fellow police officer.\n\n\u201cWe found out that a total of 17 women were sexually violated,\u201d Chizuma said. \u201cFive of them were under 18. One of the five girls was actually defiled. Eight women were raped. The rest, police found them doing their menses so were just violently beaten.\u201d\n\nBut observers note a lack of evidence, as victims failed to obtain medical exams after the alleged assaults and were unable to identify police officers, whose faces were covered.\n\nMeanwhile, no officers have yet been suspended or detained, and government authorities are questioning the validity of the report.\n\nFollow and Subscribe Nyasa TV :", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Msundwe", "Rape", "Duncan Mwapasa", "Malawi Police"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 13:00:59 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Malawi breaking news publishing 24 hours a day news about Malawi, Malawi Business, Malawi Tourism, Malawi Politics, Malawi News", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Malawi breaking news publishing 24 hours a day news about Malawi, Malawi Business, Malawi Tourism, Malawi Politics, Malawi News", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Police institute second\u00a0Msundwe rapes inquiry - Malawi Nyasa Times - News from Malawi about Malawi", "description": "Malawi breaking news publishing 24 hours a day news about Malawi, Malawi Business, Malawi Tourism, Malawi Politics, Malawi News", "url": "https://www.nyasatimes.com/police-institute-second-msundwe-rapes-inquiry/", "site_name": "Malawi Nyasa Times - News from Malawi about Malawi", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nyasatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/a-Nyasa-Times-pic-5319.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.nyasatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/a-Nyasa-Times-pic-5319.jpg", "width": 517, "height": 292}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NyasaTimes-Newspaper-250647473519/", "tag": "Rape", "section": "National", "published_time": "2020-01-01T13:00:59+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Malawi breaking news publishing 24 hours a day news about Malawi, Malawi Business, Malawi Tourism, Malawi Politics, Malawi News", "title": "Police institute second\u00a0Msundwe rapes inquiry - Malawi Nyasa Times - News from Malawi about Malawi", "site": "@Nyasatimess", "image": "https://www.nyasatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/a-Nyasa-Times-pic-5319.jpg", "creator": "@Nyasatimess"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.nyasatimes.com/police-institute-second-msundwe-rapes-inquiry/"}
