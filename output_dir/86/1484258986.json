Once again, six fighters walked away with world titles and $1 million.\n\nAnd having recently signed former Bellator welterweight champion Rory MacDonald, Sefo said the goal is to continue to sign some marquee names in the sport.\n\n\u201c(I want to) sign more big name fighters (and) continue to grow,\u201d Sefo said at the post-fight news conference. \u201cBut my phone was going off like crazy throughout the show because everybody got to see the PFL show tonight and got to see all the champions get crowned.\n\n\u201cIt just goes to show that we\u2019re continuing to grow. And then adding someone like Rory to the mix, the sky\u2019s the limit for PFL \u2013 and there\u2019s a lot of discussions with other people that are interested and want to come over.\u201d\n\nAlso on the agenda moving forward is the possibility of superfights. Featherweight champ Lance Palmer and lightweight champ Natan Schulte were two names that were brought up as suggestions for a potential superfight, and while only Palmer seemed quite keen, Sefo likes the idea in general.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot in the works for PFL, and those were part of discussions along the way,\u201d Sefo said. \u201cNot necessarily Natan and Lance, but we talked about doing some superfights and whatnot. But that\u2019s part of the plan. Whether it happens next year or the year after that, I\u2019m not sure exactly. But there are discussions in terms of putting on some superfights.\u201d\n\nThe ESPN deal was arguably the biggest development for the promotion this year, giving the fighters the largest platform possible, to showcase their skills.\n\n\u201cESPN has been great,\u201d Sefo said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019ve been a great partner and the fact we\u2019re on ESPN speaks volumes. It just goes to show that \u2013 and it sends a message out there \u2013 that PFL is here and that we\u2019re alive and well and we\u2019re going to continue to sign some big names and continue to grow.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["news", "pfl", "videos", "breaking", "pfl championship 2019"], "tags": ["Breaking", "PFL Championship 2019"], "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Danny Segura", "Blue Corner", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 22:45:05 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "PFL president Ray Sefo has goals of building on his roster and signing more big-name fighters to the promotion.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/2bca1d844f05b69f1f0b535fc8139f0b?s=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "PFL president Ray Sefo has goals of building on his roster and signing more big-name fighters to the promotion.", "keywords": "news, pfl, videos, breaking, pfl championship 2019", "google-site-verification": "5wDvxU4-GE1C0w5q865ufsxxZsGaNamAAHdfs2FXGP4", "msvalidate.01": "6C7AFE373C691E833D6444FFA7F6E8A2", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ray Sefo's bucket list for 2020 includes signing more big name fighters", "url": "https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2020/01/ray-sefo-bucket-list-pfl-2020-big-name-fighters-rory-macdonald", "description": "PFL president Ray Sefo has goals of building on his roster and signing more big-name fighters to the promotion.", "site_name": "MMA Junkie", "image": {"identifier": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ray-sefo-pfl-2019-playoffs-2-post-event-interview.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 576}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T22:45:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T22:45:06+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/MMAjunkiecom/105550656158763"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@MMAjunkie", "site": "@mmajunkie", "text": {"title": "Ray Sefo's bucket list for 2020 includes signing more big name fighters"}, "image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ray-sefo-pfl-2019-playoffs-2-post-event-interview.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "gdpr": "false", "sop-property": "5874e80ec275500011a79cb4", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=876544448, app-argument=", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.uts.mmaj", "application-name": "MMA Junkie", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "UFC and MMA news, rumors, live blogs and videos", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/feed;icon-uri=https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/2bca1d844f05b69f1f0b535fc8139f0b?s=16"}, "canonical_link": "https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2020/01/ray-sefo-bucket-list-pfl-2020-big-name-fighters-rory-macdonald"}
