the first day of the year \u2013 but apparently a strong pair of trunks are optional.\n\nOne man and his Rudolph suit were among hundreds who chose to nurse their hangovers with a freezing dip at Whitley Bay, North Tyneside this morning.\n\nThe sunshine did nothing to warm the chilly waters off the coast of North East England but that didn\u2019t stop people running in and out of the waves with giant grins on their faces.\n\nBut the chills may have got the better of our man in a mankini, who was later spotted protecting his modesty by giving Rudolph a head of hair made of seaweed.\n\nQuite the sight (Picture: NNP)\n\nSome immediate regret showcased at Whitley Bay this morning (Picture: North News)\n\nIf you keep your arms above water everything is fine (Picture: PA)\n\nSomehow still smiling in the sunshine (Picture: PA)\n\nSanta seems to have lost his way after Christmas Day (Picture: North News)\n\nLocal Panama Swimming Club had organised the New Year\u2019s Day Dip in previous years but today it was not officially organised by any group or individual.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead the event was spread through word-of-mouth but people had been urged not to take part due to safety fears.\n\nTynemouth Volunteer Life Brigade had warned members of the public against going into the sea, stating that they may not have realised there are no official organisers and no apparent safety precautions in place.\n\nIn a statement on social media, the organisation said: \u2018A few years ago, the event was organised by a local swimming club.\n\n\u2018However, their participation has now ended and we are concerned that most people taking part will be unaware of this change.\n\n\u2018To be clear, we are not saying that going into the sea is a dangerous act.\u2019\n\nThey added: \u2018With the prospect of hundreds of people entering the water in one go, we are concerned that participants may go further into the sea than they would normally, and will also be at risk of cold water shock given the time of year and cold sea conditions.\n\n\u2018We are releasing this message because we have genuine concerns that a serious incident could take place and that those involved may be expecting a level of organisation and safety cover that will not be present.\u2019\n\nThey may look like they\u2019re enjoying themselves but these poor souls are actually now frozen in this position for all eternity (Picture: PA)\n\nIt\u2019s incredible they\u2019ve managed to crack a smile (Picture: PA)\n\nAt least your head is warm (Picture: PA)\n\nDespite warnings, hundreds took part in the Whitley Bay dip (Picture: PA)\n\nIt appears the warning didn\u2019t stop swimmers taking part today \u2013 to the amusement of those watching at the sidelines wrapped in coats, hats and scarves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there were more brave swimmers stripping off and splashing around at the beach in Kinghorn, Fife, in Scotland.\n\nAlmost 200 people took part in The Loony Dook, which dates back to 1986 when it was jokingly suggested as a cure for Hogmanay hangovers.\n\nNow the New Year\u2019s bash raises money for charities with the Kinghorn event raising \u00a31,295 for the RNLI.\n\nThree brave women were spotted wearing bright pink Flintstones inspired costumes while one man took the plunge in a shirt and tie along with two hot water bottles.\n\nYabba dabba don\u2019t do this at home (Picture: SWNS)\n\nWell it\u2019s one way to shake off a Hogmanay hangover (Picture: SWNS)\n\nAlmost 200 people managed to make it into the water in Fife (Picture: SWNS)\n\nSomeone\u2019s got the right idea (Picture: SWNS)\n\nNeil Chalmers, a helmsman at Kinghorn Lifeboat Station, said: \u2018We\u2019re delighted. It\u2019s really great to see the community out to support us.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve had a really busy year with 82 call outs which is a record number for us.\n\n\u2018Fundraising events like this help to fund the training and equipment.\u2019\n\nOther places where people were crazy enough to swim today:\n\nThe pleasant waters of Salford Quays, Greater Manchester (Picture: Rex)\n\nOh dear\u2026perhaps someone should remind her what happened (Picture: Rex)\n\nThis woman turned a worrying shade of purple during the Scarborough Lions Club charity New Year\u2019s Day Dip in Scarborough, North Yorkshire (Picture: PA)\n\nA lovely day for dogs at Saltburn-By-The-Sea, North Yorkshire (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe Saltburn dip takes place each year in aid of the Saltburn Animal Rescue Association (Picture: Getty)\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
