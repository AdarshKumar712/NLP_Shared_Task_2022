Photo by Ascha Steinbach / EPA-EFE\n\nJan. 1 (UPI) -- Gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzees were among the dozens of animals killed in a New Year's Day fire at a zoo in in western Germany.\n\nWitnesses reported seeing low-flying Chinese sky lanterns, miniature kite-like balloons with candles inside, drifting over Krefeld Zoo, according to Gerd Hoppmann, head of the city's criminal police force.\n\nPolice and firefighters responded to reports of a fire at the zoo, just before 1 a.m. local time.\n\nMore than 30 animals -- nearly all the animals in the zoo -- were killed in the fire, according to news reports. The list animals lost in the fire included five orangutans, two gorillas, a chimpanzee and several monkeys. Some birds and fruit bats were also killed.\n\nThough officials with the zoo, located near the German-Dutch border, originally reported all the residents of the ape house were lost, later reports revealed the rescue of two chimpanzees. A separate open-air gorilla enclosure was unscathed, leaving a male silverback gorilla, Kidogo, and his family unharmed.\n\nZoo officials described the rescue of the two chimps, female Bally and male Limbo, as a \"miracle.\"\n\nSadly, the oldest living silverback gorilla in an endangered species breeding coordinated by European zoos, a 48-year-old ape named Massa, died in the fire.\n\nWhile private firework shows are allowed in most German states and cities, Chinese fire lanterns are banned.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Top News", "World"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Brooks Hays"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzees were among the dozens of animals killed in a New Year's Day fire at a zoo in in western Germany.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "Gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzees were among the dozens of animals killed in a New Year's Day fire at a zoo in in western Germany.", "keywords": "Top News, World", "news_keywords": "Top News, World", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzees were among the dozens of animals killed in a New Year's Day fire at a zoo in in western Germany.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2020/01/01/Dozens-of-animals-killed-in-fire-at-German-zoo/2591577894784/", "title": "Dozens of animals killed in fire at German zoo", "type": "article", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/2591577894784/2020/1/15778978412389/v1.5/Dozens-of-animals-killed-in-fire-at-German-zoo.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPI", "title": "Dozens of animals killed in fire at German zoo", "description": "Gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzees were among the dozens of animals killed in a New Year's Day fire at a zoo in in western Germany.", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2591577894784/2020/i/15778978412389/v2.1/Dozens-of-animals-killed-in-fire-at-German-zoo.jpg?lg=4"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2020/01/01/Dozens-of-animals-killed-in-fire-at-German-zoo/2591577894784/"}
