Kim is not crazy nor is he suicidal. His goal is not to start a nuclear war that will spark a massive U.S. retaliation that would destroy his country and could result in his own death. His goal is to get relief from U.S. and international economic sanctions without giving up his nukes.\n\nAll it would take is the nuclear weapons aboard just one U.S. Navy ballistic submarine \u2013 carrying an astounding 192 nuclear warheads \u2013 to wipe out North Korea in roughly 20 minutes. Its population of 25 million people would be killed \u2013 all from just one submarine lurking below the surface in the Pacific Ocean \u2013 and Kim knows that. That\u2019s some real \u201cfire and fury.\u201d\n\nThe North Korean dictator \u2013 who follows his grandfather and father in leading his nation like a communist hereditary monarch \u2013 has a clearly established goal we can all relate to: survival.\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight. Kim is not crazy nor is he suicidal. His goal is not to start a nuclear war that will spark a massive U.S. retaliation that would destroy his country and could result in his own death. His goal is to get relief from U.S. and international economic sanctions without giving up his nukes.\n\nKim believes that his nuclear weapons are the ultimate insurance policy against an attack by the U.S., South Korea or any other nation aiming to overthrow his regime.\n\nKim knows that U.S. and United Nations forces attacked his country in the Korean War, and is well aware that American forces have waged long wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq in the years since. He doesn\u2019t want any foreign forces seeking regime change in a second Korean War with either a conventional or a nuclear attack \u2013 and knows his nukes can act as a deterrent to prevent that.\n\nNorth Korea has made huge sacrifices to build up its small but very dangerous arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles. Although the nation has an economy smaller than the state of Montana and can barely feed its own people, it has beaten the odds to join the nuclear club.\n\nBut because the North has spent huge sums of money and endured years of international economic sanctions to go nuclear, it\u2019s not realistic to expect to Kim to simply hand over all his nuclear bombs and missiles to the U.S. anytime soon.\n\nDemanding such a full denuclearization in return for eventual sanctions relief \u2013 something that would take years \u2013 is not a policy at all, but a recipe for disaster, simply ensuring that Kim builds more and bigger nuclear weapons.\n\nA senior White House adviser told me that he considers North Korea \u201ca fourth-world nation that could kill 100 million people in an hour \u2013 and that\u2019s just with nukes, never mind all those chemical and biological weapons. North Korea is a Pandora\u2019s box that \u2013 if you open it with military force \u2013 will spark at the very least a mini Armageddon.\u201d\n\nFrom all of this, a very clear strategy can emerge for the Trump administration if it can take a more long-term approach. The administration needs to understand that for at least the short to medium term, North Korea will be unwilling to give up its nuclear arms \u2013 the regime said as much just weeks ago.\n\nFor now, Team Trump must focus on starving the regime of any resources it can get its hands on to advance its nuclear program through the tightest sanctions possible and depriving the Kim family of any technology that could advance such a cause.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the beginning. Washington must also ensure that Pyongyang does not sell any of its nuclear or missile technology. There is clear evidence that North Korea and Iran have traded such knowledge over the years.\n\nAmerica must do all it can to ensure that such transfers stop and that no other nation gains from North Korea\u2019s nuclear advances \u2013 and prevent Pyongyang from making money off them to advance its weapons of mass destruction programs.\n\nSuch a policy of what amounts to a Cold War-style containment must be matched by a willingness to continue dialogue. The history of U.S.-North Korea relations is filled with too many ups and downs \u2013 tensions and breakthroughs that are too dangerous to continue.\n\nWe must be willing to try and remove the reasons that North Korea feels it needs nuclear weapons. That can only be done by building trust. As a start, a formal peace declaration ending the Korean War should be signed. In addition, liaison offices should be set up in each nation\u2019s capital to ensure a crisis does not end up in a shooting war.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFrom there, both sides should work on small steps to remove all military threats facing the other \u2013 both nuclear and conventional. In fact, we should make the nuclear disarmament of North Korea the end goal of a long-term policy shift that could take years but lead to a more stable, less up-and-down relationship.\n\nNone of this will be easy. In fact, it would be much easier to do what every other U.S. administration has done on North Korea: confront the regime when it acts aggressively, punish it with sanctions and sound tough, but then move on to the next global crisis or challenge at home when missiles stop heading skyward. That would be a mistake.\n\nEventually, President Trump or a future president may reluctantly come to the painful conclusion that getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons is as impossible as trying to get Russia, China, India, Pakistan, or another member of the nuclear club to turn back the clock and give up its nukes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShould that day come, our fallback position should be to press for an arms control agreement to limit the North Korean nuclear force to the smallest size possible in return for normalized relations.\n\nPast U.S. leaders weren\u2019t happy when the Soviet Union and China went nuclear \u2013 but weren\u2019t prepared to start a nuclear war to force their denuclearization. And in all the years since, no nation has launched a nuclear attack.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY HARRY KAZIANIS", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Harry J.
