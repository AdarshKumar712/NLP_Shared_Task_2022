David was a great innovator and made the game we love what it is today. This is a horrible loss.\"\n\nStern also presided over four NBA lockouts, including two that resulted in shortened seasons in 1998-99 and 2011.\n\nStern, who had remained affiliated with the NBA and held the title of commissioner emeritus, was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2014 and the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\n\"David took over the NBA in 1984 with the league at a crossroads,\" current commissioner Silver added in his statement, adding that Stern \"ushered in the modern global NBA. He launched groundbreaking media and marketing partnerships, digital assets and social responsibility programs that have brought the game to billions of people around the world.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Obit", "Stern", "NBA"], "tags": ["Trump Administration", "Immigration", "Donald Trump", "Trump Impeachment", "2020 Elections", "China"], "authors": ["Brian Mahoney"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "David Stern, NBA\u2019s Commissioner for 30 Years, Dies at 77", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"epoch": 1577896154, "pubdate": "2020-01-01T16:29:14", "article": {"section": "newsfront", "published_time": "2020-01-01T16:29:14", "author": "BRIAN MAHONEY"}, "og": {"description": "David Stern, who spent 30 years as the NBA's longest-serving commissioner and oversaw its growth into a global power, has died on New Year's Day.
