For me, it\u2019s more than a number. It\u2019s a milestone. For the past decade \u2014 with the stalwart support and encouragement of readers and advertisers \u2014 we have been building a community news organization that now covers a combined population of 100,000 in Edmonds, Lynnwood and Mountlake Terrace.\n\nYet, many times I still feel like I\u2019m in a one-sided relationship.\n\nDuring the past decade, news organizations of all sizes \u2014 from the Guardian to the New York Times to The Seattle Times \u2014 realized that there weren\u2019t enough advertising dollars to keep them solvent, and so they began an aggressive campaign for readers\u2019 financial support. You have heard this from me, as well. It costs money to provide good journalism. The news may appear in your Facebook feed for free, but it isn\u2019t free to write or photograph or edit or publish it.\n\nI am grateful for our advertisers. They help keep us afloat financially. I am also thankful to the 1,000 or so readers who have been either regular and one-time financial supporters over the past decade.\n\nBut that leaves many thousands of people who read us regularly, but still haven\u2019t given us a cent.\n\nEver.\n\nSo for me, the 2020s will be the decade of demanding support. And I am using the word \u201cdemand\u201d intentionally. Your financial support is imperative. It\u2019s not optional. It\u2019s not a \u201cnice thing\u201d to do. It must be done to ensure we are here when 2030 rolls around.\n\nThe next 10 years will bring many changes to our region. In addition to population growth that we are already experiencing, light rail will arrive in South Snohomish County in just four years. Our local cities are already preparing to accommodate these developments.\n\nCount on us to be your eyes and ears as these changes unfold. We\u2019ll report on city council and school board meetings. We\u2019ll photograph open houses, ribbon cuttings and grand openings. We\u2019ll provide robust coverage of local elections, high school sports, the arts and restaurants.\n\nWe will also continue to give you a forum to express your opinions, air your grievances and offer your compliments.\n\nIt\u2019s our commitment to you.\n\nNow it\u2019s your turn.\n\nSupport us here.\n\nHappy New Year.\n\nTeresa", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Gary Olson", "Theresa Hernandez", "Carolynne Harris", "Leroy Valdok", "Randal White"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 08:01:01 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://myedmondsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/edmond-favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "My Edmonds News - An online gathering place for neighbors and friends", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "From the Publisher's Desk: Here's to a new decade - and the end of a one-sided relationship - My Edmonds News", "description": "Dear readers: Welcome to 2020.
