(Not even the vase that President Trump suggested.) While most of us were expecting either a weapon\u2019s test or a missile launch, all remained quiet in the hermit nation for the remainder of the year. But this morning the dictator released a statement through his country\u2019s state-run media outlets that appears to explain what the real \u201cpresent\u201d was going to be. As of today, North Korea is no longer considering itself bound to the weapons testing moratorium agreed to between Kim and Trump. (NY Times)\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, \u200bsaid his country no longer felt bound by its self-imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, its official media reported on Wednesday, the strongest indication yet that the country could soon resume such tests\u2026 North Korea has not conducted a long-range missile test or a nuclear test in more than two years. Mr. Kim had announced his moratorium at a time when he hoped negotiations with the United States \u2014 and his budding personal relationship with President Trump \u2014 would prompt the United States to begin lifting crippling sanctions.\n\nKim was still being rather vague about what he plans to do, but he promised that the world would soon see a \u201cnew strategic weapon\u201d being deployed from the Korean Peninsula. (The Hill)\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned the world will witness \u201ca new strategic weapon\u201d from the isolated nation in the \u201cnear future\u201d as nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang are stuck in a stalemate. According to reports of his remarks from North Korean state media, Kim blasted the U.S. for its \u201chostile policy\u201d toward North Korea and said he had no expectation Washington would lift sanctions on his country soon.\n\nReached for comment at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump appeared to discount the threat, saying that he still believes Kim Jong-un is \u201ca man of his word\u201d and will find a way to close the deal. Of course, that\u2019s pretty much been Trump\u2019s modus operandi throughout this entire process. Keep flattering Kim while refusing to give in to his demands. And Trump will no doubt continue to play nice until it\u2019s time get tough.\n\nAs long as North Korea is only talking about violating the agreement and not actually doing it, there\u2019s still time to cut a deal. It\u2019s even conceivable that Trump could put some small concession on the table along the lines of a partial withdrawal of one or two minor sanctions. That would at least give Kim something to take home and claim a victory if he\u2019s willing to at least continue the moratorium, if not actually start dismantling his nukes.\n\nBut in reality, those nukes are the only thing keeping Kim in power, at least in his view. It\u2019s almost impossible to conceive of him really carrying through on a comprehensive denuclearization program.\n\nSo if he doesn\u2019t, what might the \u201cnew strategic weapon\u201d be? Intelligence analysts seem to think it will be one of two things. Either he\u2019ll light off a fully functional hydrogen bomb or he\u2019ll test an ICBM with solid fuel propellant that can definitely make it all the way across the Pacific to the west coast of the United States. Either one would be provocative in the extreme and send us right back to where we were stuck before Trump reached out to him.\n\n2020 may be starting off on an upward path domestically but in terms of our negotiations with North Korea, we\u2019re already hitting a sour note. And with Russia and China courting Kim\u2019s favor these days, I\u2019m not particularly hopeful of the situation improving any time soon.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["denuclearization", "icbms", "Kim Jong-un", "missiles", "North Korea", "nuclear weapons"], "tags": ["North Korea", "icbms", "denuclearization", "missiles", "Kim Jong-un", "nuclear weapons"], "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Ho ho ho", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/themes/hotair-desktop/images/ha_favicon/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "denuclearization, icbms, Kim Jong-un, missiles, North Korea, nuclear weapons", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/themes/hotair-desktop/images/ha_favicon/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/themes/hotair-desktop/images/ha_favicon/mediumtile.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/themes/hotair-desktop/images/ha_favicon/widetile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/themes/hotair-desktop/images/ha_favicon/largetile.png", "post-id": 4221808, "post-type": "post", "description": "Ho ho ho", "robots": "noodp", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Here's North Korea's New Year's gift to the world", "description": "Ho ho ho", "url": "https://hotair.com/archives/jazz-shaw/2020/01/01/heres-north-koreas-new-years-gift-world/", "site_name": "HotAir", "updated_time": "2020-01-01T08:52:23-05:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kim-Jong-Un.jpg", "width": 715, "height": 378}, "referenced": "https://hotair.com/archives/jazz-shaw/2020/01/01/heres-north-koreas-new-years-gift-world/"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/hotaircom", "tag": "nuclear weapons", "section": "The Blog", "published_time": "2020-01-01T09:01:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T08:52:23-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 312482775445602, "pages": "41632789656,103971336305218,319569361390023,106547192707583,124538510989702,283971595408,15418366158,153162531376557,127519040661256,123834811060739,305174559545115,321502821264274,413465452078762,492802317512753,140705212665688,116757565026850,114013445328868"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ho ho ho", "title": "Here's North Korea's New Year's gift to the world", "site": "@hotairblog", "image": {"identifier": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kim-Jong-Un.jpg", "src": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kim-Jong-Un.jpg"}, "creator": "@hotairblog"}}, "canonical_link": "https://hotair.com/archives/jazz-shaw/2020/01/01/heres-north-koreas-new-years-gift-world/"}
