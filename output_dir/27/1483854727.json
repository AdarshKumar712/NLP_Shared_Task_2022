This is a term that gets thrown around all too frequently, usually to express dismay at a story that one simply doesn't agree with.\n\nThe actual definition is the deliberate spread of disinformation or hoaxes via the media. A few weeks ago the editor of a Yorkshire newspaper had to do battle with the 'fake news' claims and it's a great example of why trusted local news is more important than ever as we head into a new decade.\n\nThe story in question was about a young boy who had to sleep on a hospital floor because there were no beds.\n\nSocial media went into meltdown, slamming the newspaper, saying it simply couldn't be true.\n\nThe newspaper explained how it had done the basic journalism of verifying the story with the hospital before publication, while those on social media could hide behind a moniker and publish spurious claims without a single check.\n\nWe had our own example recently, where one of our reporters picked up on a story via social media. That's often the way these days \u2013 but social media is merely another source and we will always then verify any information before publishing a story. This particular one involved cameras appearing in Helston. One person gave an apparent explanation on the original social media post, which resulted in another person saying \"social media wins again, who needs local newspapers?\"\n\nBut what had been written wasn't right, we discovered when we asked the council about it, and we then went on to publish our story, with the correct explanation.\n\nAnd that's the difference \u2013 you can't believe everything you read on social media, but when it's published under the banner of the Packet, you can be assured that it has been verified before being published.\n\nThank you for your support and I wish you a happy New Year.\n\nThe editor's regular column can be read every week in the Packet, on sale each Wednesday for 85p.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 09:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "It's natural at this time of the year to both reflect and to look ahead.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/resources/icon/", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "OMG-Verify-V1": "4389-366acdfc-5224-4c07-bb70-f74d8fbfc2db", "og": {"url": "https://www.falmouthpacket.co.uk/news/18127016.editor-happy-new-year/", "site_name": "Falmouth Packet", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.falmouthpacket.co.uk/resources/images/10843671/", "width": 715, "height": 843}, "title": "From the editor: Happy New Year", "type": "website", "name": "From the editor: Happy New Year", "description": "It's natural at this time of the year to both reflect and to look ahead."}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.falmouthpacket.co.uk/resources/images/10843671/"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "From the editor: Happy New Year", "description": "It's natural at this time of the year to both reflect and to look ahead."}, "fb": {"app_id": 138696206196437, "pages": 110406802463430}, "medium": "news", "title": "From the editor: Happy New Year", "description": "It's natural at this time of the year to both reflect and to look ahead."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.falmouthpacket.co.uk/news/18127016.editor-happy-new-year/"}
