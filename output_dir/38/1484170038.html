<p>Flight attendants have a lot of responsibilities in the air, a fact some passengers don&apos;t seem to realize.</p><p>To make matters worse, some passengers act as if their preferences are more important than everyone else&apos;s by ignoring their seat assignments, keeping their headphones in when flight attendants ask for their drink order, or clipping their nails at their seat.</p><p>These are the nine most annoying things airline passengers do, according to interviews Business Insider conducted with eight flight attendants. The flight attendants were granted anonymity due to a fear of reprisal from their employers.</p>

                                    <p>&quot;I think the biggest one for me is when people don&apos;t take the seat belt sign seriously,&quot; a United Airlines flight attendant said.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s one thing for a grown woman or a grown man to stand up and &#x2014; you&apos;ve got to do what you&apos;ve got to do, if you&apos;ve got to go to the bathroom or something. But a lot of times, it will be pretty bumpy and they&apos;ll let their two-year-old or their four-year-old just stand up and wander around the aircraft. That, to me, is not OK. Not only are you not listening, but you&apos;re putting your kid at risk.&quot;</p>
