In a sense, her own political fortunes could hang in the balance.\n\nA review by THE CITY, building on data and analysis by The Texas Tribune, suggests Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 district could be particularly vulnerable to undercount because a little over a quarter of those living there are non-citizens.\n\nThat\u2019s a higher percentage than any other congressional district in the state.\n\nA Census undercount in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 district and elsewhere in the state could lead to the elimination of congressional districts \u2014 potentially setting off politically charged redistricting battles.\n\nNew York already is on track to lose up to two congressional seats during reapportionment due to population decline and slower rate of growth, according to a December report by Election Data Services.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.teaparty.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Favicon-Tea-Party.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "google-site-verification": "BUmroTlpSK6UfDeL-RF65T8u9-kL5ZhBtj6sufpwNGY"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.teaparty.org/what-a-shame-aoc-could-lose-her-house-seat-after-2020-through-elimination-of-her-district-423030/"}
