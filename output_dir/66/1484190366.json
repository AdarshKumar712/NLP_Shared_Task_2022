a provincially mandated sticker decrying the federal carbon tax from a gas pump has been dropped.\n\nJesse Seguin, 36, was charged with criminal mischief in October after police alleged he removed an Ontario government-mandated sticker from a gas pump at a Cornwall gas station.\n\nThe \u201cfederal carbon tax transparency sticker\u201d, which must be displayed on an easily visible place on every gas pump in Ontario outside of a First Nation, was mandated by the Progressive Conservative government last August as a way to convince more Ontarians to oppose the federal carbon tax.\n\nThe federal tax was imposed on the province after the Ford government cancelled Ontario\u2019s cap-and-trade program and refused to create a carbon tax of its own.\n\nSeguin was arrested and released from custody with a court date in late November, but the charge was withdrawn by the Crown.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["OC Sessions", "Videos", "Observer", "Phoenix"], "authors": ["Updated",
