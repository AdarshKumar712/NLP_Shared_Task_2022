Police said the fire may have been caused by sky lanterns launched to celebrate the new year.\n\nSeveral witnesses reported that they had seen the cylindrical paper lanterns with little fires inside flying in the night sky shortly after midnight Wednesday near the Krefeld zoo, Gerd Hoppmann, the city\u2019s head of criminal police told reporters.\n\n\u201cPeople reported seeing those sky lanterns flying at low altitude near the zoo and then it started burning,\u201d Hoppmann said.\n\nPolice and firefighters received the first emergency calls at 12:38 a.m.\n\nThe zoo near the Dutch border said that the entire ape house burned down and more than 30 animals, including five orangutans, two gorillas, a chimpanzee and several monkeys, as well as fruit bats and birds, were killed.\n\nOnly two chimpanzees could be rescued from the flames by firefighters. They suffered burns but are in stable condition, zoo director Wolfgang Dressen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s close to a miracle that Bally, a 40-year-old female chimpanzee, and Limbo, a younger male, survived this inferno,\u201d Dressen said, adding that many animal handlers were in shock at the devastation.\n\n\u201cWe have to seriously work through the mourning process,\u201d Dressen said. \u201cThis is an unfathomable tragedy.\u201d\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nThe zoo director also said than many of the dead animals were close to extinction in the wild.\n\nThe zoo said that in addition to the two rescued chimpanzees, the Gorilla Garden near to the Ape House didn\u2019t go up in flames and that gorilla Kidogo and six other members of his family group are alive.\n\nCriminal police officer Hoppmann said that the use of sky lanterns is illegal in Krefeld and most other parts of Germany and asked that the people who launched them or people who witnessed anything should come forward to police.\n\nGermans usually welcome in the new year with fireworks at midnight and private persons are allowed to buy and launch fireworks. Sky lanterns, however, are both illegal and uncommon in Germany.\n\nSky lanterns, which are sometimes also called Chinese lanterns, are a sort of hot-air balloon made of paper. They have been used in Asia for celebratory events for centuries.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nHoppmann said investigators found some used lanterns on the ground that hadn\u2019t burned entirely. They were 34 centimetres (13.4 inches) long, made out of white paper with an opening at the bottom where a small fire would have been suspended. The fire heats the air inside, making them fly and shine at night.\n\nGet more of the Star in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Star.
