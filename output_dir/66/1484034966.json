No injuries were reported.\n\nBorough Mayor Vern Halter declared a local emergency and the borough is seeking a state disaster declaration, officials said.\n\nThe borough evacuated residents and pets from more than a dozen homes, including five that officials said were damaged by floodwater.\n\n\u201cYesterday, we moved 800 pounds (363 kilograms) of dog food and yak food \u2014 those are some of the exotic animals that are in there,\u201d Barkley said, adding that two food transports were scheduled Monday with the possibility of another for emergency supplies.\n\nUpcoming work is expected to include installation of a bridge and a culvert where water flowed over a road, Barkley said.\n\nBoat and ATV operators continued to help shuttle some residents in and out of the area, while others remained in place or are stayed elsewhere.\n\nOnce the roads are passable, the borough will begin working on the ice that caused the flooding, Barkley said.\n\n\u201cWe still have the ice dam there that needs to be addressed, but right now we\u2019re trying to get it to where it\u2019s safe enough for residents to come in and out, so they don\u2019t have to rely on us and can be self-sufficient,\u201d Barkley said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Associated Press", "Alaska", "Alaska News"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Some residents of an Alaska borough were still contending with blocked roads preventing easy access to their homes a week after an ice jam caused a creek to flood, officials said.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/static/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Some residents of an Alaska borough were still contending with blocked roads preventing easy access to their homes a week after an ice jam caused a creek to flood, officials said.", "keywords": "Associated Press,Alaska,Alaska News", "site": "beststates", "zone": "statenews/articles", "fb": {"pages": 5834919267, "app_id": 130063997038366}, "og": {"title": "Roads Still Blocked for Alaska Residents Week After Flooding", "description": "Some residents of an Alaska borough are still contending with blocked roads preventing easy access to their homes a week after an ice jam caused flooding.", "type": "article", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "url": "https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/alaska/articles/2020-01-01/roads-still-blocked-for-alaska-residents-week-after-flooding"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@USNews", "title": "Roads Still Blocked for Alaska Residents Week After Flooding", "description": "Some residents of an Alaska borough are still contending with blocked roads preventing easy access to their homes a week after an ice jam caused flooding."}, "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "optimizely": "Optimizely is supported by this application but is not enabled for this page."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/alaska/articles/2020-01-01/roads-still-blocked-for-alaska-residents-week-after-flooding"}
