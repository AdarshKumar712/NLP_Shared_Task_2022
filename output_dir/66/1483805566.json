him last month in an assault case, has been arrested from Palghar district in Maharashtra, an official said on Wednesday.\n\nThe accused, Santosh Shende, a resident of Shendepada in Vikramgadh taluka, was earlier booked for assaulting a man who stood guarantee for him in court in a case filed by Shende's estranged wife for seeking maintenance.\n\nOn December 19, when the police went to arrest Shende in connection with the assault case, he allegedly hurled a crude gelatin bomb at the security personnel and ran away, police spokesman Hemant Katkar said.\n\nNo one was injured in the incident, he said, adding that search was underway for the accused since then.\n\nThe police finally managed to arrest the accused here on Tuesday, Katkar said.\n\nHe was booked under IPC Sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of duty), 286 (rash or negligent act with explosive substance to\n\nendanger human life) and 224 (intentionally resisting lawful apprehension), and the Explosive Substances Act.\n\nGet the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.
