Instead tourists are encouraged to feed, groom and care for elephants, gaining an unforgettable experience with one of nature's most majestic creatures.\n\nBut charities warn that even seemingly benign options, like bathing them, could still be problematic.\n\n\"Bathing with elephants...is often stressful for elephants and mahouts especially when dealing with groups of excited young people,\" Jan Schmidt-Burbach of World Animal Protection told AFP.\n\n\"The best option is to leave it to the elephant to decide if and how to bath and ask tourists to stand back to observe and enjoy this moment without interference.\"\n\nBut even this may not be enough.\n\nSome animal rights experts warn it can be hard to discern the treatment of the animals after the crowds have gone home. Some reported cases of elephants at so-called sanctuaries being chained for long hours, forced to sleep on concrete, and malnourished.\n\n- Ethical tourism? -\n\nOf the 220 elephant parks identified across the country, even if many promise ethical tourism, \"only a dozen ensure truly satisfactory living conditions\", according to WAP.\n\nIt is working with ChangChill, a small organisation near Chiang Mai, bordered by a river in the middle of rice terraces.\n\nIn a few months, it changed its methods to give elephants more space, fewer interactions, and an environment resembling life in the wild.\n\n\"We don't force them to do what they wouldn't instinctively do,\" says director Supakorn Thanaseth.\n\nAs a result, they are \"less sick, calmer\".\n\nThe risk of accidents with tourists has decreased as the animals are less stressed, though mahouts still have a hook in a bag for emergencies.\n\nChangChill hopes to become profitable in the current high season, but it will only be able to receive around 40 tourists a day to visit its six elephants as part of its aim to put the creatures first.\n\nThat is a drop in the bucket when Thailand has nearly 4,000 \"domesticated\" elephants.\n\nThai authorities are reluctant to reintroduce them into natural habitats, as advocated by some NGOs, because of a lack of space and potential conflict with humans.\n\nThe compromise, some argue, is to better regulate the sector and improve standards.\n\nBut there is little impetus to enact more stringent rules that would cut into the Thai tourism industry, which welcomed more than 38 million visitors this year.\n\nA committee of several animal welfare associations submitted recommendations to the government last year advocating stricter controls for elephants in captivity.\n\nBut according to activist Sovaida Salwala from Friends of the Asian Elephants, an NGO who helped compile the report, their requests \"remain unanswered so far\".\n\nIn fact, there is some evidence the animals' situation is getting worse.\n\nSchmidt-Burbach said their last research in 2015 found some 1,771 elephants whose welfare was in question.\n\nHe explained: \"There are 357 more elephants in poor conditions compared to our 2010 study.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["international", "Economy", "Business & Finance"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Sophie Deviller",
