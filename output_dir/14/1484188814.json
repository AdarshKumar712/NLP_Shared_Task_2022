The video now has 4.8 million views.\n\nA year later, Santer supports herself financially with the money she earns online.\n\nShe shared how she makes money as a college influencer and how much she made from YouTube ads in 2019.\n\nIn 2019, she earned just over $44,000 from ads in her YouTube videos, according to a screenshot viewed by Business Insider.\n\nSign up for Business Insider's influencer newsletter, Influencer Dashboard, to get more stories like this in your inbox.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nSienna Santer is a second-year Harvard student and a popular YouTube influencer with 302,000 subscribers.\n\nShe shares videos on topics like how she got into the prestigious university and what a day in her life is like.\n\nSanter's influencer career started with friends and family members asking her how she got accepted into Harvard. After a video of her Harvard dorm-room tour got 4.8 million views, Santer treats her YouTube channel and Instagram page like a part-time job.\n\n\"I had so many people asking how I got in and if I could give them advice,\" she told Business Insider. \"Instead of writing back and forth, I decided to put everything into a video and send that to them.\"\n\nNow she earns money from ads in her videos placed by Google and by promoting brands like Audible and the vitamin company Care/of on her channel.\n\nIn 2019, she earned just over $44,000 through Google's AdSense program, which places ads in her YouTube videos, according to a screenshot viewed by Business Insider. (She said she'd have to pay about 25% of that in taxes.)\n\nHow YouTube creators like Santer earn money online\n\nCreators with 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours are eligible for YouTube's Partner Program, through which they can earn money off their channels by placing ads in videos.\n\nSanter averages about $3,000 a month from AdSense, she said.\n\n\"My channel has helped me deal with things a lot earlier than some of my friends and helped me a lot with money-management skills,\" she said. \"I have checks for AdSense coming in the mail that I have put aside for taxes, retirement, savings.\"\n\nHow much an influencer earns from Google's AdSense program on a YouTube video depends on a number of factors, from the place in the video where viewers normally drop off to the type of advertisers the video gets. Some top creators have ad-placement strategies for earning the most money possible. Generally, how much money is earned varies based on a video's watch time, length, and viewer demographic.\n\nSome videos that contain swearing or copyrighted music can be flagged by YouTube and demonetized, earning hardly any money for the creator (or none at all).\n\nSanter previously told Business Insider that she usually adds two to three ads to a video that is over 10 minutes long and follows certain techniques to optimize her video's performance.\n\nSanter is part of a rising trend of YouTubers that are gaining audiences by sharing their college experiences \u2014 especially their move-in videos, which can rack up millions of views (and in Santer's case, thousands of dollars). Margot Lee, a Syracuse student with 425,000 YouTube subscribers, teaches an informal pop-up class on becoming a professional influencer to her classmates (and shared her slides with Business Insider).\n\nRead more on Santer's YouTube business here:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "publish_date": "Mon Dec 30 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Sienna Santer, a second-year student and YouTube influencer with 302,000 subscribers, shared how much money she made from Google's AdSense in 2019.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "//www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "title": "A Harvard student with 302,000 YouTube subscribers breaks down how much money she earned in ad revenue in 2019 as a college influencer", "date": "2019-12-30", "news_keywords": "BI Prime, Digiday Deal, Influencer, YouTube, Amanda Perelli", "description": "Sienna Santer, a second-year student and YouTube influencer with 302,000 subscribers, shared how much money she made from Google's AdSense in 2019.", "author": "Amanda Perelli", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "locked", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Media", "og": {"title": "A Harvard student with 302,000 YouTube subscribers breaks down how much money she earned in ad revenue in 2019 as a college influencer", "description": "Sienna Santer, a second-year student and YouTube influencer with 302,000 subscribers, shared how much money she made from Google's AdSense in 2019.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-harvard-youtube-influencer-earned-one-year-2019-12", "image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dc097b37eece5215c162cb7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "A Harvard student with 302,000 YouTube subscribers breaks down how much money she earned in ad revenue in 2019 as a college influencer", "sailthru.date": "2019-12-30", "sailthru.tags": "BI Prime, Digiday Deal, Influencer, YouTube, Amanda Perelli", "sailthru.description": "Sienna Santer, a second-year student and YouTube influencer with 302,000 subscribers, shared how much money she made from Google's AdSense in 2019.", "sailthru.author": "Amanda Perelli", "sailthru.verticals": "media, prime, thewire, advertising, sai", "sailthru.image.full": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5e04e4a1855cc244aa535b03?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5e04e4a1855cc244aa535b03?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@businessinsider"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"masthead": "variant", "commerce-menu-on-post": "variant", "bi6-under-bullets": "control"}, "viking-id": "5e0a06e0855cc249c14b7e74", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-harvard-youtube-influencer-earned-one-year-2019-12"}
