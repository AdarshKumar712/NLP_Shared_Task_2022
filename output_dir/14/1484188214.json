Thousands of Indians brought in the New Year on Tuesday night with protests all over the country. Social media buzzed with protest notes and invitations to demonstrations at midnight. One note from the women of the Shaheen Bagh neighborhood in South Delhi \u2014 who have been holding a nonstop 17-day protest \u2014 invited people to join them for biryani, tea and protest songs and slogans to bring in the new year and \u201csalute the fallen heroes in the struggle against this fascist regime, in Kashmir, in Assam, in Uttar Pradesh, in Karnataka, hit by police brutality in all corners of the country\u201d and \u201cto mark the first nationwide revolution for a new secular India.\u201d\n\nAnti-government protests had been brewing across India since almost 2 million people were stripped of their citizenship in the northeastern state of Assam earlier this year as part of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government\u2019s National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise that makes it mandatory for all Indians to provide certain documents to prove citizenship.\n\nThat was followed by the Modi government\u2019s move to implement the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), passing a bill on Dec. 11 that offers a fast track to Indian citizenship for non-Muslim refugees from the neighboring countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh \u2014 specifically Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Christians who arrived in India before 2014. Protesters say that by granting citizenship to these communities but discriminating against Muslims, Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist government is undermining India\u2019s secular constitution.\n\nIn response, tens of thousands of Indians have taken to the streets of Indian cities, in what marks the first serious opposition to the Modi administration since he took office in 2014. The protests grew after Dec. 15, when Delhi Police stormed into one of India\u2019s oldest Muslim-majority universities \u2014 Jamia Millia Islamia \u2014 to curb student protests. A few hours later, police in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state, cracked down on the Aligarh Muslim University, another Muslim majority university. After images of the crackdown on students at Jamia and Aligarh University started surfacing, the protests exploded. More than 1,100 people have been arrested so far and over 5,558 kept in preventive detention.\n\nTogether with the NRC, critics say the citizenship law is part of a broader plan by Modi\u2019s party to expel Muslims. \u201cWe had to be here,\u201d a young female student told TIME at an emergency protest in central Delhi on Dec 15. As police officers pushed against them with their riot gear, she stood holding hands with her peers in a human chain. \u201cWe are here in solidarity with the students and with everyone else in this country. We cannot be silent anymore.\u201d\n\nWhile much of India has been roiled by protests in the last three weeks, the violence has been particularly bad in Uttar Pradesh, where an estimated 19 people have died. The northern state is home to more than 200 million people, 19% of whom are Muslims. In cities across the state \u2014 from Lucknow to Meerut to Kanpur to Bijnor to Varanasi \u2014 there has been a constant stream of videos and reports of illegal detention, arrests on false charges, open firing on peaceful protesters, arson and looting by the police.\n\nThe state is ruled by Hindu monk Yogi Adityanath from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Appointed the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh in 2017, the 47-year-old \u2014 in his saffron robe, shaved head, and crimson mark on his forehead \u2014 unapologetically represents the interests of a Hindu state. In 2002, he founded a Hindu youth militia, headquartered in his constituency. The group, which describes itself as \u201ca fierce cultural and social organization dedicated to Hindutva and nationalism,\u201d was charged by the police for inciting riots, arson and murder in Mau in eastern Uttar Pradesh in 2005.\n\nChief Minister of Uttar Pradesh state Yogi Adityanath celebrates the party's victory in Lucknow, India, on May 23, 2019. | Rajesh Kumar Singh\u2014AP More", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Nilanjana Bhowmick New Delhi"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 14:02:05 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Hindu monk Yogi Adityanath, who has served as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh since 2017, has overseen a brutal crackdown on protesters.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Hindu monk Yogi Adityanath, who has served as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh since 2017, has overseen a brutal crackdown on protesters.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GogE_KazLOqOppVW3nT1nw--~B/aD0xNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/35d894241148059f996fe442e7ad06b1", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GogE_KazLOqOppVW3nT1nw--~B/aD0xNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/35d894241148059f996fe442e7ad06b1"}, "title": "Why This Indian State Is Witnessing the Country's Most Violent Anti Citizenship-Law Protests"}, "application-name": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines", "news_keywords": "Uttar Pradesh, Narendra Modi, Indian citizenship, Yogi Adityanath, secular India, Bharatiya Janata Party, India Gate, Muslims", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=fd647775-ff16-3908-a979-4b5d70684b90&src=web", "description": "Hindu monk Yogi Adityanath, who has served as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh since 2017, has overseen a brutal crackdown on protesters.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GogE_KazLOqOppVW3nT1nw--~B/aD0xNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/35d894241148059f996fe442e7ad06b1", "description": "Hindu monk Yogi Adityanath, who has served as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh since 2017, has overseen a brutal crackdown on protesters.", "title": "Why This Indian State Is Witnessing the Country's Most Violent Anti Citizenship-Law Protests", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/why-indian-state-witnessing-countrys-140205213.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 338028696036, "app_id": 458584288257241}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=fd647775-ff16-3908-a979-4b5d70684b90&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=fd647775-ff16-3908-a979-4b5d70684b90&src=web"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://news.yahoo.com/why-indian-state-witnessing-countrys-140205213.html"}
