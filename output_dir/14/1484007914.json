governments have a constitutional duty to implement laws passed by Parliament and those vowing not to implement the Citizenship Amendment Act should seek appropriate legal opinion.\n\nHe said it was surprising that those who have come to power by taking oath under the Constitution are making \"unconstitutional\" statements.\n\nHis statement came a day after the Kerala Assembly passed a resolution urging the Centre to withdraw the amended citizenship law.\n\nUnion Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad: There is a Constitutional obligation on every state to exercise the executive power in such a way that ensures compliance with laws made by Parliament. #CitizenshipAmendmentAct. pic.twitter.com/JrZ1uhctfW \u2014 ANI (@ANI) January 1, 2020\n\nPrasad said the governments which claim they would not allow the CAA or are getting resolutions passed against implementing it should seek appropriate legal opinion on constitutional provisions.\n\n\"It is the constitutional duty of the states to implement laws passed by Parliament,\" Prasad told reporters here.\n\nHe said Parliament can make laws on subjects under the Union List which includes citizenship.\n\nTo drive home his point that states cannot oppose laws passed by Parliament, he referred to Clause 2 of Article 245 of the Constitution.\n\n\"Article 245 (clause 2) states that no law made by Parliament shall be deemed to be invalid on the ground that it would have extra-territorial operation,\" he said.\n\nOther states including West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have said they will not implement the amended Citizenship Act.\n\nFind latest and upcoming tech gadgets online on Tech2 Gadgets.
