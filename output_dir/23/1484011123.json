However, with Blaugrana sources confirming to AS their interest in bringing the 21-year-old back to the Camp Nou, the offer is seen at the club as the first step towards a deal, either in January or in the summer window.\n\nOlmo keen to \"take the next step to keep on improving\"\n\nSpeaking to the Spanish television programme 'Jugones' last week, Olmo admitted that he's eyeing a move from Dinamo, where he has made 124 first-team appearances in five seasons. \"Last summer was the ideal moment to take the next step, but in the end it didn't happen and, as I said then, I was happy [to stay] because I wanted to play in the Champions League,\" he said. \"But I think my cycle there has ended and it's time to take the next step to keep on improving.\"\n\nAS understands that Dinamo are open to negotiating a transfer following their European elimination, but will not accept any less than 30 to 35 million euros for a player who was included in UEFA's Champions League 'breakthrough team' for 2019. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid have also targeted Olmo this January after being impressed by his displays, although the purchase of a striker is their current priority.\n\nOlmo given maiden Spain cap in November\n\nOlmo has a burgeoning reputation in world football after not only shining in the Champions League group stage, but also starring for Spain in their European Under-21 Championship victory in the summer. Only the performances of Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz prevented him from being named the tournament's best player, although he was chosen as 'man of the match' in La Rojita's 2-1 final win over Germany.\n\nTo top off a successful 2019, the midfielder was handed his senior Spain debut in November's Euro 2020 qualifier against Malta, capping his international bow with a goal as the Spaniards recorded a thumping 7-0 triumph.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Qatar 2022", "Ligue 1", "Athletes", "Football leagues", "Santander League", "Trending topics", "Society", "31/12/2019 15:15", "Tikitakas", "Most read", "BARCELONA", "Real Madrid", "Barcelona", "People", "Teams", "More news", "Competitions", "Sporting organisations", "News", "Europa League", "First division", "FC Barcelona", "Dani Olmo", "Sports", "At.
