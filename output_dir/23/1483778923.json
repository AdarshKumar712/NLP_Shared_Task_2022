burning south of the Snowy Mountains Highway in the Ellerslie Range near Kunama and Laurel Hill was at \"emergency\" level at 4.30pm.\n\nThe blaze has ripped through more than 100,000 hectares.\n\nSix

Cooma and the 104,000ha Green Valley fire east of Albury.\n\nAn out-of-control blaze is also burning in Werri Berri, north of Bemboka near Bega.\n\nMore than 2500 firefighters are battling the blazes.\n\nWHAT IS THE DEATH TOLL?\n\nSeven people have died since Monday evening, taking the number of deaths this season in NSW to at least 15.\n\nA 70-year-old man was found dead on Tuesday outside a home at Yatte Yattah, west of Lake Conjola, a man's body has been discovered in a burnt-out car near the Princes Highway at Yatte Yattah, another man in a vehicle in Sussex Inlet and a body outside a home at Coolagolite, east of Cobargo.\n\nYoung father Patrick Salway, 29, his dad Robert Salway, 63, and volunteer firefighter Sam McPaul, 28, were confirmed dead earlier this week in separate blazes that ravaged the state's south.\n\nA 72-year-old man remains missing at Belowra, west of Narooma, while a 70-year-old woman is missing after her home in Conjola Park was destroyed by fire on Tuesday.\n\nHOW MANY HOMES HAVE BEEN LOST?\n\nMore than 175 homes have been confirmed destroyed on the south coast since Monday including 89 in Conjola Park, 40 in Malua Bay and 15 in Rosedale.\n\nAt last count, 1087 homes have been confirmed destroyed across NSW since July.\n\nTHE WARNINGS\n\nWednesday's fire danger rating is severe in the central ranges and a total fire ban has been declared in that area.\n\nTotal fire bans are also in place in the southern slopes and southern ranges where the fire danger rating is very high.\n\nFire danger is also rated as very high in the greater Sydney region, the Monaro alpine region, north western NSW, the ACT, the Hunter, and the northern slopes.\n\nFORECAST\n\nHot, dry and windy conditions were expected to bring elevated fire danger to the southern and central ranges and southern slopes on Wednesday.\n\nParts of the state got some reprieve from the soaring temperatures on Wednesday with forecasts of 27C in Nowra, 34C in Penrith in western Sydney, while the mercury was expected to climb to 36C in Tumut in the Riverina and 42C in the Hunter.\n\nSydney was under a smoke haze on Wednesday morning with a fair-air quality, and cloudy and windy conditions forecast.\n\nDangerous fire conditions are expected to return to the south coast on Saturday where the temperature is forecast to reach 43C.\n\nTHE ROADS\n\nMotorists are advised to avoid travel to the south coast and Snowy Mountains Riverina area where fires caused widespread power outages and major road closures.\n\nThe Snowy Mountains Highway is closed between Tumut Plains Road and Adaminaby.\n\nThe Princes Highway remains closed between Falls Creek and Milton, Batemans Bay and Moruya, Brogo and Tilba Tilba, and Narrabarba and Cann River (Victoria).", "keywords": [],
