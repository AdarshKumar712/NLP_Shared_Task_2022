The image of Francis slapping his way free from the clutches of the admirer was an instant hit on social media. A personal apology followed. \u201cWe lose patience many times,\u201d Francis confessed. \u201cIt happens to me too. I apologize for the bad example given yesterday,\u201d the head of the Catholic church said before celebrating Mass at the Vatican.\n\nNSC chief slashing Obama's\n\n'bloated' staff to create efficient,\n\ntight-lipped White House operation 23 replies Posted by MissMolly \u2014 Post Reply The White House National Security Council staff is being downsized sharply in a bid to improve efficiency within the policy coordinating body by consolidating positions and cutting staff. A second, unspoken thrust of the overhaul is a hoped-for end to what many critics see as a string of politically damaging, unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information. Leaks of President Trump\u2019s conversations with foreign leaders and other damaging disclosures likely originated with anti-Trump officials in the White House who stayed over from the Obama administration, according to several current and former White House officials. White House National Security Adviser Robert C. O\u2019Brien is leading the NSC reform effort.\n\nHere are the 5 biggest Republican\n\nmistakes of the decade 22 replies Posted by tisHimself \u2014 Post Reply For Republicans, the 2010s end with the party seemingly in a better situation than it was when the decade started. The GOP has control of the White House and the Senate. Ten years ago, the Democrats held the White House and both houses of Congress. But that scorecard doesn't tell the whole story. Thanks to five major blunders over the last decade, the Republican Party is actually weaker than it was on Jan.1, 2010. To understand why, you have to document each key mistake in order:\n\nReport: Iran-Backed Militiamen Retreat\n\nfrom U.S. Embassy in Baghdad 21 replies Posted by Imright \u2014 Post Reply Iran-backed militiamen behind an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, have begun retreating from the area on Wednesday following a threat from President Donald Trump to hold Tehran accountable for the siege. \u201cSupporters of the Kataib Hezbollah militia who had spent the night camped outside the embassy began dismantling their tents and leaving the area, saying they had won a victory and would now seek the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq through the nation\u2019s parliament,\u201d the Washington Post reports. The development comes after Department of Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced\n\nNasty Nancy, Shifty Schiff, and Schumer\n\nsubvert the Constitution to damage Trump 21 replies Posted by ladydawgfan \u2014 Post Reply Nancy Pelosi, AKA Nasty Nancy, allowed Adam Schiff, AKA Shifty Schiff, to run the impeachment \"inquiry\" through Shifty's Intelligence Committee, where Shifty had total control. He set the rules to allow only the witnesses he wanted. He lied in his opening statement to commence the inquiry by making up President Trump's phone conversation with Ukraine's President Zelensky. The resulting vote to impeach was a foregone conclusion regardless of the evidence, or lack thereof. Pelosi has not sent Shifty's articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial because she said she wants to first see the Senate trial procedures.\n\nMedia Continues With Awful Hot Takes\n\nAbout the 'Terrifying' Armed Churchgoers\n\nin Texas Shooting 20 replies Posted by Hazymac \u2014 Post Reply Ever since it was discovered that several armed churchgoers drew their weapons to stop a gunman at a church in Texas last week, the anti-gun mainstream media types have been trying to tell the public that armed, law-abiding citizens are a bad thing. The New Year's Day installment of media malpractice hyperbole arrives courtesy of the nauseatingly leftist USA Today: \"@USATODAY Opinion: Jack Wilson is exactly the type of person you want around with a gun because he's a firearms instructor. But we know nothing about the at least six other parishioners who also appeared to draw their handguns. And that's terrifying.\"\n\nAs more women run for office,\n\nchild care remains a hurdle 20 replies Posted by voxpopuli \u2014 Post Reply When Kimberly Dudik ran for her fourth term in the Montana House, state officials told her she could not use campaign money to pay for child care for her four young children. She is now running for attorney general and is trying to visit a big chunk of the sprawling state, spending hours on the road. That means she needs even more help picking up her kids at school and day care when she's away and her husband has a late night at the office. (snip) Only six states have laws specifically allowing campaign money to be used for child care.\n\nTwo tribes aren\u2019t recognized federally. Yet\n\nmembers won $500 million in minority contracts 16 replies Posted by MissMolly \u2014 Post Reply Companies set up by members of a self-described and state-recognized Creek Indian tribe in Alabama have received more than $240 million in federal minority-business contracts, despite a determination by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs that there is no credible evidence the group has Native American ancestry, a Los Angeles Times investigation has found. Federal contracts worth an additional $273 million have gone to two companies run by a member of a different Native American group in Alabama with no federal recognition as a tribe.\n\nHow this anti-Semitism came\n\nto be: The virulent hatred\n\nsnowballed over the years 15 replies Posted by MissMolly \u2014 Post Reply Orthodox Jews around the country \u2014 and specifically in the tri-state area \u2014 were still reeling from the shooting at a kosher deli earlier this month when we gathered with our families to celebrate the holiday of Chanukah. But that air of tranquility was shattered by a string of nearly a dozen anti-Semitic attacks over the holiday, the most severe of which was a mass stabbing at a rabbi\u2019s home upstate as he lit his menorah. The stabbing attack succeeded in bringing to the fore what we visibly Orthodox Jews have known for quite some time: There\u2019s a growing epidemic of anti-Semitism in this country, specifically targeting Orthodox Jews,\n\nTrump cuts loose with\n\nunpredictable characters\n\nat Mar-a-Lago 14 replies Posted by 4Justice \u2014 Post Reply PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 At the White House, people who want to meet with Donald Trump have to deal with schedulers, scores of aides hovering around the president and a strict security protocol. At Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s luxury South Florida resort where he typically spends Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve, the president is just another guy in the buffet line.\n\nBitter Clingers in Texas Shoot Back 14 replies Posted by tisHimself \u2014 Post Reply The reason the Founders put the Second Amendment in the Constitution, the document Democrats and liberals selectively embrace or read things into when convenient, was seen last Sunday at the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas, near Forth Worth where, dare we say it again, good guys with guns stopped a bad guy with a gun. Note the plural is used here, for video footage shows at least seven guns were drawn with seconds of the killer opening fire on the parishioners inside, killing two. But only two, as a wider massacre was stopped by those who don\u2019t believe in gun-free zones.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Steven Kessler", "Ryan Lovelace", "Jake Novak", "Adam Mill", "Daniel John Sobieski", "Jordan Carney", "Tamar Lapin", "Paul Kengor", "Daniel Horowitz", "Larry Alex Taunton"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Many on both ends of the political spectrum are aware of the fact that social justice is simply Marxism, masquerading as a new ideological movement.
