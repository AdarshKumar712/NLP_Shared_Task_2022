Remember the angry emoji incident not long after his signing?\n\nThis latest, stunning lack of professionalism, has to end with him being shown the exit door.\n\n#FCB | Arturo Vidal files complaint against Barcelona over \u20ac2.4 million worth of unpaid bonuses https://t.co/x2VOMJdZWi \u2014 Republic (@republic) December 30, 2019\n\nHe may well be owed bonuses by the club, but playing out the situation in the public domain is, I would suggest, purely to engineer a move away, most likely to Inter. That is abhorrent.\n\nHis assertion that it\u2019s his agent and lawyer that are taking things forward, as if to absolve himself of blame, is preposterous, and it followed on from his training ground meltdown pre-Clasico when he realised that he wouldn\u2019t be making the starting XI against Real Madrid.\n\nThese types of childish actions do not befit a 32-year-old experienced professional.\n\nThough he would be a loss to the squad for what he does bring to both the pitch and the dressing room, Barca can\u2019t possibly countenance keeping a player that has denounced them in public and filed a lawsuit against them whilst still in their employ.\n\nIf the board aren\u2019t a laughing stock already, they will be if they allow Vidal to stay after this.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jason Pettigrove", "Dec"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "More unrest from the Chilean", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/blog/favicon/337/favicon-d937048f.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Barca Blaugranes", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BarcaBlaugranesSBN", "published_time": "2019-12-31T07:00:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2019-12-31T07:00:00+01:00"}, "author": "Jason Pettigrove", "style-tools": "https://www.sbnation.com/style/community/337/d7dd66133d9d9d2bd3ec9fabcaac6084/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "description": "More unrest from the Chilean", "og": {"description": "More unrest from the Chilean", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SGHkV3-mnI_3ufty9NPtiZNvjYs=/0x0:4282x2242/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19561941/1138970875.jpg.jpg", "alt": "Deportivo Alaves v FC Barcelona - La Liga Santander", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Barca Blaugranes", "title": "Why Arturo Vidal must follow Carles Alena out of the Barca exit door", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2019/12/31/21042501/why-arturo-vidal-must-follow-carles-alena-out-of-the-barca-exit-door"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2019/12/31/21042501/why-arturo-vidal-must-follow-carles-alena-out-of-the-barca-exit-door", "title": "Why Arturo Vidal must follow Carles Alena out of the Barca exit door", "description": "More unrest from the Chilean", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kp51k69RMx4TluQwIvIrm5EPZsM=/0x0:4282x2141/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19561941/1138970875.jpg.jpg", "alt": "Deportivo Alaves v FC Barcelona - La Liga Santander"}, "site": "BlaugranesBarca"}, "sailthru.title": "Why Arturo Vidal must follow Carles Alena out of the Barca exit door", "sailthru.tags": "la-liga,soccer,barcelona,barca-blaugranes,cant-del-blog-barcelona-opinion,front-page,transfer-rumors,barcelona-transfer-news-rumors,soccer-sg", "sailthru.description": "More unrest from the Chilean", "sailthru.date": "2019-12-31T07:00:00+01:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uO_ZktxFVpvqMCTwQHxqvJ1EGYA=/0x0:4282x2409/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65999869/1138970875.jpg.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rccuQmgcqWRxFjnQlabq9qttmvY=/781x0:3636x2855/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65999869/1138970875.jpg.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/blog/sbnu_logo_minimal/337/touch_icon_ipad_retina_barcablaugranes.com.minimal.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#234597", "outbrainsection": "cant-del-blog-barcelona-opinion"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2019/12/31/21042501/why-arturo-vidal-must-follow-carles-alena-out-of-the-barca-exit-door"}
