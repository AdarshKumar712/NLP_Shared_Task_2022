The Catholic Church forbids abortion.\n\nFrancis didn\u2019t mention if under his watch things might change in how women are treated in the Catholic church. According to Vatican teaching, women can\u2019t become priests. And the top job \u2014 the papacy \u2014 has been strictly for males.\n\nHe contended that if we want a better world in the new year, we should treat women with dignity.\n\nFrancis urged that women become \u201dfully associated\u201d with decision-making to make the world more united and at peace.\n\n\u201cAnd if we want a better world, that is a house of peace and not a courtyard of war, may the dignity of every woman be at the heart of it,\u201d Francis said. \u201cWomen are givers and mediators of peace, and should be fully associated with decision-making processes.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cFor when women can transmit their gifts, the world finds itself more united and more in peace. So, a conquest for women is a conquest for the whole of humanity.\u201d\n\nFrancis didn\u2019t comment on how the Catholic church treats women. As well as women not being allowed to be priests, some conservative elements of the Catholic church are scandalized by parishes that allow girls to be altar servers. And, as The Associated Press has reported, there have been instances of priests \u2014 who are supposed to be celibate \u2014 impregnating women and then not recognizing the child as their offspring.\n\nReflecting on the state of affairs of the church, Francis cautioned against divisions, blaming the devil for those who emphasize differences, ideologies and factions.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["news", "pope francis"], "tags": ["Pope Francis"], "authors": ["Ap Wire Service"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "VATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis is pinning much of his hopes for a more peaceful world in the new year on women, saying violence against them is akin to profaning God and calling for them to be increasingly involved in making major decisions.
