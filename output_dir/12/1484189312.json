Just ask Liz Warren.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., tirelessly attacks the greed and self-interest of America\u2019s wealthy, the \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d who, she claims, are \u201cwaging war on America\u2019s middle class.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the millionaires to pay their fair share!\u201d Warren demands.\n\nBut when it comes to spreading the wealth to charitable causes and community service, Warren is one of the millionaires who apparently hasn\u2019t gotten the message.\n\nAccording to the tax returns Warren has posted on her campaign website, she and her husband, Bruce Mann, have earned more than $10 million since 2008, but they\u2019ve rarely donated more than 4 percent of their income to charitable causes.\n\nFor example, in 2014 Warren earned more than $1.6 million but gave just 2.7 percent to charity. The following year she took in nearly $1.2 million, but donated just 2.3 percent.\n\nAll that changed, however, in 2017 when Warren was preparing to enter the presidential race. That year her charitable donations suddenly spiked to 8.4 percent, leading some to speculate that her newfound generosity was more about electability than philanthropy. In 2018, she donated 5.5 percent of her income to charity.\n\nExclude her \u201cpresidential primary\u201d years, and Warren donated an average of just 3.5 percent of her millions in income to charitable causes. That number is low for the typical American in her income bracket (the typical millionaire donates nearly twice that amount), and it sounds particularly ungenerous given her political platform of income redistribution, trillion-dollar tax increases and \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that!\u201d rhetoric.\n\nSign up for The Point Go inside New York politics.

Bernie Sanders, Warren\u2019s the Oprah Winfrey of the Democratic field.\n\nIn 2016, Sanders donated just $10,600 of his $1 million income \u2014 around 1 percent \u2014 to charity. His total household donations since 2009 manage to get him to the 2 percent level.\n\nAccording to analysis by Forbes magazine, the least charitable Democrat is also the poorest: Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Despite his progressive bona fides, including a \u201cpaid\u201d volunteerism program, Buttigieg has donated just 1 percent of his income to charity since 2009.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s former Vice President Joe Biden, who made headlines in 2008 when Barack Obama tapped him to be his running mate it was discovered the Bidens had donated just $3,690 to charity over the course of an entire decade. He\u2019s since raised that number to 6 percent, much of it donated to Biden family foundations.\n\nThus far the issue of charitable giving hasn\u2019t come up on the campaign trail, perhaps because Democratic primary voters are also less likely to support charitable causes themselves.\n\nAccording to multiple studies, Americans on the left are less charitable than their Republican counterparts. States that supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 were, on average, less generous in their charitable giving than those carried by Donald Trump.\n\nArthur C. Brooks, a social scientist at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School and author of the book on charitable giving \"Who Really Cares\" says his research finds, \u201cPeople who favor government income redistribution are significantly less likely to donate to charity than those who do not.\u201d\n\nData from the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy show that a smaller percentage of Americans are donating to charity each year, but overall donations are rising. In fact, over this same 2009-2017 period during which millionaire candidates like Warren and Sanders give so little, total U.S. donations to charity rose by nearly $100 billion, from $314 billion to $410 billion.\n\nThe same \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d whose greed is allegedly endangering our democracy are giving more to charity and community service. Even as progressive politicians give so little.\n\nThere are exceptions, most notably Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. The former mayor of Newark has donated nearly half a million dollars \u2014 about 11 percent of his income \u2014 to charity over the past decade. Unfortunately, Democratic primary voters aren\u2019t being as generous toward his campaign and Booker continues to linger around 2 percent in the polls.\n\nFrom free health care for illegal immigrants to paying off everyone\u2019s student loan debt, Elizabeth Warren has lots of plans for taxpayer-funded generosity. American voters may want to ask why her charity doesn\u2019t begin at home.\n\nMichael Graham is politics editor for InsideSources.com.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Michael Graham"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 15:00:31 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "If you woke up New Year\u2019s Day feeling guilty about all those last-second charitable solicitations you ignored, it might ease your conscience to know you weren\u2019t alone.
