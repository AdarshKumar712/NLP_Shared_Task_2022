And it\u2019s in great shape, as you know.\u201d\n\nHe compared the recent attacks to the devastating attacks in Benghazi in 2012, noting that he would never stand for similar results.\n\n\u201cThis will not be a Benghazi. Benghazi should never have happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will never, ever be a Benghazi.\u201d\n\nThe president warned Iran from continuing to back militia attacks in Iraq but dismissed the idea that the United States was going to war with Iran.\n\n\u201cI want to have peace. I like peace,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Iran should want peace more than anybody. So I don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d\n\nThe president also spoke about the impeachment effort led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI think the impeachment thing \u2014 I call it impeachment light,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. And Nancy Pelosi should be ashamed of herself. She\u2019s a highly overrated person. I know her well; she\u2019s highly overrated.\u201d\n\nTrump said he looked forward to an impeachment trial in the Senate.\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019d be very happy with the trial because we did nothing wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president even wished the press a Happy New Year.\n\n\u201cI want you to have a great year. Look, you\u2019re honorable people. You have to stay honorable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re honorable, I\u2019m going to win the election by a lot. If you\u2019re not honorable, I\u2019m just going to win the election by a little. So I\u2019d rather have you be honorable, okay?\u201d\n\nWhen First Lady Melania Trump was asked about her hopes for the New Year, she replied, \u201cPeace on the world.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump agreed but said he would not reveal his New Year\u2019s resolution.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure you\u2019re supposed to say resolutions out loud, okay?\u201d he said. \u201cSo we don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to say what my resolution is because I think we jinx it, all right?\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Iraq", "Donald Trump", "B Inspired", "New Year", "Iran Talks Big", "Iran", "Melania Trump", "Bernie Banks", "Nancy Pelosi", "Benghazi"], "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "President Donald Trump welcomed guests to Mar-a-Lago for a New Year's Eve party on Tuesday evening, predicting great things for 2020.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.svg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "President Donald Trump welcomed guests to Mar-a-Lago for a New Year's Eve party on Tuesday evening, predicting great things for 2020.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Trump Brings in 2020 at Mar-a-Lago: 'We\u2019re Going to Have a Great Year'", "description": "President Donald Trump welcomed guests to Mar-a-Lago for a New Year's Eve party on Tuesday evening, predicting great things for 2020.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/12/31/trump-brings-2020-mar-a-lago-were-going-have-great-year/", "site_name": "Breitbart", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/donald-trump-melania-mar-a-lago-2020-new-years-getty-640x335.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/donald-trump-melania-mar-a-lago-2020-new-years-getty-640x335.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 335, "alt": "`US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump speak to the press outside the grand ballroom as they arrive for a New Year's celebration at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on December 31, 2019.
