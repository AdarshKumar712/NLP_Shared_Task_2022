Precisely six weeks old at the end of 2019, Google\u2019s game-streaming platform will truly grow up this year. Here\u2019s a look at everything that\u2019s yet to come.\n\nWireless Stadia Controller for mobile, desktop\n\nEven if what appears on the screen is streaming from a faraway server, having a wire from your phone or PC attached to a game controller is not very futuristic. The first-party Made by Google\u2019s signature direct Wi-Fi connectivity is only available on the Chromecast Ultra.\n\nWhile the best and most familiar gaming experience for the majority is in front of a large television, mobile and web are what truly emphasize that no console is required. Those two form factors extend AAA gaming outside the home, and that\u2019s a first for general gamers. The Google Store listing for Stadia Premiere Edition explicitly states that extended availability is \u201ccoming in 2020.\u201d\n\nFeature parity\n\nMobile\n\nClosely related to expanded wireless Stadia Controller support is a grab bag of features only found when playing with Chromecast Ultra. For example, screen/clip capture is not available through the controller on mobile (or web), while Android devices can only hear voice chats. There is no way to respond or even start parties on smartphones. Similarly, Assistant is only available on the streaming dongle, with achievements not available on mobile yet.\n\nMost of those limitations are presumably related to the Stadia Controller not being able to communicate those actions over a cable. Regardless, it\u2019s confusing for people expecting the same experience on whatever device they want to play with.\n\nWeb\n\nGameplay on Mac, Windows, and Linux fares better than Google\u2019s mobile operating system. The biggest feature limitation is 1080 p-only gameplay that does not allow users to experience Stadia\u2019s 4K promise. Another gripe is the lack of \u201cData usage and quality\u201d or \u201cDisplay\u201d settings online, while viewing Captures are mobile only \u2014 and all platforms could benefit from basic sharing.\n\nSupport for more Android devices and iOS\n\nStadia is currently limited to the Pixel 2, Pixel 3, Pixel 3a, and Pixel 4 family of devices. Google\u2019s mid-range phones make it evident that flagships are not required to run Stadia. Of course, what people are really asking for is iOS and \u2014 specifically \u2014 the iPad. Any tablet would be better suited for mobile gameplay than a phone.\n\nGoogle noted during an AMA before launch that it wants \u201cStadia to run on every screen eventually.\u201d It hopes to \u201cstart expanding to more devices next year.\u201d\n\nAndroid TV support\n\nThanks to a leaked conference presentation, we learned in September that \u201cStadia integration\u201d is coming to Android TV with Android 11 in 2020. This would be in line with a push to bring the service to devices that people already own.\n\nIn-game Google Assistant\n\nSpeaking of Assistant, Google\u2019s cross-device help tool currently has very limited capabilities on Stadia. The most useful game-related functionality is asking to launch a title. At GDC 2019, Google imagined Assistant being able to find video walkthroughs when you\u2019re stuck.\n\nThis is likely a more gargantuan task than meets the eye. Fundamentally, Assistant has to be aware of what\u2019s occurring in games. That presumably requires developers to create in-game markers, with YouTubers making similar markups.\n\nYouTube\n\nStreaming\n\nAnother ambitious integration is YouTube. But to start with, Google could allow for basic gameplay streaming. This is surprisingly missing for a service that the company touted as generating an extra feed that\u2019s specifically for YouTube.\n\nInteractive sharing\n\nMore broadly, there is an opportunity to leverage the large gaming community on Stadia by just having them join streaming creators with Crowd Connect. Also interesting would be State Play where people could share a specific scenario and let others replicate or beat a scenario.\n\nLTE, cellular gameplay\n\nStadia requires an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection, with LTE not explicitly supported today. That said, the workaround is just making a hotspot with your phone and connecting your laptop. Microsoft\u2019s xCloud beta currently supports LTE networks, and Google could be looking to optimize.\n\nStadia Store improvements\n\nAt 26 titles with various editions, the Stadia Store badly needs search and not just curated sections. Meanwhile, pre-ordering has been hinted at, while \u201cFamily\u201d functionality should extend beyond just parental controls. There should be the ability to share games even if only one user is allowed to play at a time.\n\nHowever, the most important addition to the Stadia Store would be demos. The first aim is to let people actually test how the platform runs on their network for free, and would go a long way to address skepticism. Down the road, streaming Stadia demos could expose gamers to new technologies or concepts. The other reason is of course trying a title before buying.\n\nStadia Base and monthly Pro subscription\n\nJoining Stadia is not as simple as you\u2019d expect for a web service. A $129 buy-in is currently required with Google clearly wanting the first users to have everything they need to experience on a TV.\n\nStadia Base is expected to come in 2020 to let players just buy games outright without needing Stadia Pro. The $9.99 subscription provides 4K quality, a free game every month, and discounts. It\u2019s a pretty good value, but most will make do with 1080p, especially to just try out how Stadia works for them.\n\nThat said, even more vital is some sort of demo experience that would truly showcase how accessing Stadia is as simple as clicking a link.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
