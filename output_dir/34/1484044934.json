Been (sic) a Pope doesn\u2019t make you immune to Pain or avoid Reaction to pain,\u201d one typical comment read.\n\nIn his first Mass of the New Year, the pontiff nonetheless denounced Wednesday \u201call violence against women\u201d as \u201ca profanation of God, born of a woman,\u201d a position underscored by several Twitter enthusiasts.\n\nAnother concluded that as 2020 dawned, \u201cthe pope is trending.\u201d\n\nPope Francis confessed Wednesday he had \u201clost patience\u201d with an exuberant admirer who had grabbed his hand on Saint Peter\u2019s Square, prompting a swift pair of slaps.\n\n\u201cWe lose patience many times. It happens to me too. I apologise for the bad example given yesterday,\u201d the head of the Catholic church said before celebrating Mass at the Vatican.\n\nAFP\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["break free", "Nativity"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 14:34:15 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i0.wp.com/www.blueprint.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fav-1.png?fit=30%2C30&ssl=1", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Pope: Why I slapped a woman", "url": "https://www.blueprint.ng/pope-why-i-slapped-a-woman/", "description": "An image of Pope Francis slapping his way free from the clutches of an admirer late Tuesday had social media abuzz with comments on the pontiff\u2019s prompt riposte.
