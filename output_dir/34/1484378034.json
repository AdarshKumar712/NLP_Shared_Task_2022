She also promised a \"greener\" Bogota under her mayorship.\n\nShe called on Bogotans to build a citizen's culture that \"once and for all banishes all racism, classism, machismo and zenophobia\" from its streets.\n\n\"Bogota, thank you very much for trusting me with your present and your future. I promise to honor that trust, and give everything of myself so that our Bogota will be in the next four years a more caring, inclusive and sustainable city and region,\" she said.\n\nLopez married her partner Angelica Lozano, a senator, on Dec. 16.\n\nShe first stepped into the national spotlight after helping to expose links between Colombian lawmakers and right-wing paramilitary groups.\n\nShe was briefly forced to flee the country after the scandal came to light but returned to be elected senator in 2014 and stood as a vice presidential candidate in last year's national elections.\n\nLopez won the Oct. 27 mayoral poll with just over 35% of the vote in a narrow triumph over liberal Carlos Fernando Galan.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Caribbean News", "woman", "first woman", "mayor", "bogota", "first", "woman mayor"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "BOGOTA - Bogota's first woman mayor Claudia Lopez took office Wednesday promising leadership in the troubled Colombian capital", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.midwestradionetwork.com/web/premier/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Bogota&#039;s First Woman Mayor Pledges to Fight Racism, Xenophobia", "description": "BOGOTA - Bogota&#039;s first woman mayor Claudia Lopez took office Wednesday promising leadership in the troubled Colombian capital", "keywords": "Caribbean News, woman, first woman, mayor, bogota, first, woman mayor", "news_keywords": "Caribbean News, woman, first woman, mayor, bogota, first, woman mayor", "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "1 Day", "og": {"title": "Bogota&#039;s First Woman Mayor Pledges to Fight Racism, Xenophobia", "site_name": "Caribbean Herald", "url": "https://www.caribbeanherald.com/news/263584270/bogotas-first-woman-mayor-pledges-to-fight-racism-xenophobia", "description": "BOGOTA - Bogota&#039;s first woman mayor Claudia Lopez took office Wednesday promising leadership in the troubled Colombian capital", "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1577923516.jpg", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@caribbeanherald", "title": "Bogota&#039;s First Woman Mayor Pledges to Fight Racism, Xenophobia", "description": "BOGOTA - Bogota&#039;s first woman mayor Claudia Lopez took office Wednesday promising leadership in the troubled Colombian capital", "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1577923516.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.voanews.com/americas/bogotas-first-woman-mayor-pledges-fight-racism-xenophobia"}
