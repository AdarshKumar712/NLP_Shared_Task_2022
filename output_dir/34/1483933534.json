Wednesday marked the 28th consecutive day of union-led strikes that have hobbled France\u2019s much-vaunted train network and have made getting around Paris into an odyssey, with Metro lines mostly closed or spotty.\n\nUnions are gearing up for further walkouts next week, when schools reopen following a Christmas/New Year break and negotiations are set to resume with Macron\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be strikes everywhere,\u201d said Philippe Martinez, general secretary of the CGT union. \u201cWe call on all French people to mobilize, to demonstrate and to strike. My message is clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the only way that they can understand us,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his televised address on Tuesday evening as revelers were celebrating the new decade\u2019s birth, Macron said the pension overhaul \u201cwill be carried out\u201d but called on his government to \u201cfind the path of a quick compromise\u201d with unions.\n\nMacron stayed firm on the principles of the reform, including its most decried measure: raising the eligibility age for full pensions from 62 to 64. He insisted the new system will be fairer and financially sustainable.\n\n\u201cMy only compass is our country\u2019s interest,\u201d he said.\n\nThe start of 2020 was the second New Year celebration in a row where Macron has faced social upheaval. This time last year, his government was locked in conflict with the yellow-vest movement, named for the bright yellow jackets that protesters wore, against his economic agenda and policies assailed as pro-business.\n\nJohn Leicester, The Associated Press\n\n\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["NEWS 1130 Community Cruiser"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.citynews1130.com/wp-content/themes/news1130/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "For France's Macron, 2020 again brings rocky start, outlook", "description": "PARIS \u2014 Emmanuel Macron embarked Wednesday on what is shaping up to be another rocky year for his presidency of France, facing a fresh barrage of anger from critics for using a new year\u2019s address to reaffirm his commitment to fiercely contested pension reforms.
