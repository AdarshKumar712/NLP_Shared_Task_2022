Braha is seen ordering OPCW staff to \"remove all traces, if any, of its delivery/storage/whatever\" from the organisation's secure registry.\n\n*\n\nWikileaks @wikileaks\n\nMinutes from an OPCW meeting with toxicologists specialized in chemical weapons: \"the experts were conclusive in their statements that there was\n\nno correlation between symptoms and chlorine exposure\". https:// wikileaks.org/opcw-douma/#OP CW-DOUMA%20-%20Release%20Part%204 \"\n\nThe drop also includes the minutes from an OPCW toxicology meeting with \"three Toxicologists/Clinical pharmacologists, one bioanalytical and toxicological chemist\", all four of whom are specialists in chemical weapons analysis.\n\n\"With respect to the consistency of the observed and reported symptoms of the alleged victims with possible exposure to chlorine gas or similar, the experts were conclusive in their statements that there was no correlation between symptoms and chlorine exposure,\" the document reads.\n\nAccording to the leaked minutes from the toxicology meeting, the chief expert offered \"the possibility of the event being a propaganda exercise\" as one potential explanation for the Douma incident. The other OPCW experts agreed that the key \"take-away message\" from the meeting was \"that the symptoms observed were inconsistent with exposure to chlorine and no other obvious candidate chemical causing the symptoms could be identified\".\n\nLike all the other many, many, many, many different leaks which have been hemorrhaging from the OPCW about the Douma incident, none of the important information contained in these publications was included in any of the OPCW's public reports on the matter. According to the OPCW's Final Report published in March 2019, the investigative team found \"reasonable grounds that the use of a toxic chemical as a weapon took place. This toxic chemical contained reactive chlorine. The toxic chemical was likely molecular chlorine.\"\n\nWe now know that these \"reasonable grounds\" contain more holes than a spaghetti strainer executed by firing squad. This is extremely important information about an unsolved war crime which resulted in dozens of civilian deaths and led to an act of war which cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars and had many far-reaching geopolitical consequences.\n\nYet the mass media, freakishly, has had absolutely nothing to say about this extremely newsworthy story.\n\nAs of this writing, a Google News search for this story brings up an article by RT, another by Al-Masdar News, and some entries by alternative outlets you've almost certainly never heard of like UrduPoint News and People's Pundit Daily.\n\nNext Page 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Media", "Media Blackout", "Media Hypocrisy"], "tags": ["Media Hypocrisy", "Media", "Media Blackout"], "authors": ["Caitlin Johnstone"], "publish_date": "Thu Dec 19 12:00:00 2030", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Article: Media's Deafening Silence On Latest WikiLeaks Drops Is Its Own Scandal - This is getting really, really, really weird.\r\n\r\nWikiLeaks has published yet another set of leaked internal documents from within the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) adding even more material...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"description": "Article: Media's Deafening Silence On Latest WikiLeaks Drops Is Its Own Scandal - This is getting really, really, really weird.\r\n\r\nWikiLeaks has published yet another set of leaked internal documents from within the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) adding even more material...", "keywords": "Media,Media Blackout,Media Hypocrisy", "fb": {"admins": 737810614, "app_id": 157889207614942}, "generator": "Populum - \ufeffContent management software for hybrid blog/media/commerce communities", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"url": "https://www.opednews.com/articles/Media-s-Deafening-Silence-by-Caitlin-Johnstone-Media_Media-Blackout_Media-Hypocrisy-191230-126.html", "site_name": "OpEdNews", "title": "Media's Deafening Silence On Latest WikiLeaks Drops Is Its Own Scandal", "description": "This is getting really, really, really weird.\r\n\r\nWikiLeaks has published yet another set of leaked internal documents from within the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) adding even more material...", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.opednews.com/populum/visuals/2019/12/2019-12-509347-500-Uploaded-cj1-216.jpg", "width": 650, "height": 488}, "type": "website", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"title": "Media's Deafening Silence On Latest WikiLeaks Drops Is Its Own Scandal", "description": "This is getting really, really, really weird.\r\n\r\nWikiLeaks has published yet another set of leaked internal documents from within the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) adding even more material...", "image": "https://www.opednews.com/populum/visuals/2019/12/2019-12-509347-500-Uploaded-cj1-216.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@opednews"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.opednews.com/articles/Media-s-Deafening-Silence-by-Caitlin-Johnstone-Media_Media-Blackout_Media-Hypocrisy-191230-126.html"}
