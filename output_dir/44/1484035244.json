I don't want to say anything more on it\".\n\nWhen asked whether the BJP-led state government has spoken to him on the issue, Malik replied in the negative.\n\nGoa and Karnataka are locked in a bitter dispute over sharing the water of the Mahadayi river.\n\nA letter written by Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar to the Karnataka government in October, 2019, in which he reportedly exempted the neighbouring state from taking the Environment Clearance (EC) for a project on the river, had sparked a row.\n\nIn another letter on December 18, Javadekar kept his earlier communication in abeyance. However, on December 24, he again informed the Karnataka government that the EC was not required for the project on the river.\n\n\"On the issue of Mahadayi, whatever I had to do, I have done. If the government asks for my help, I would offer it...I don't want to talk about it,\" the governor said, adding that Mahadayi has become a controversial issue.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Government of India", "States and union territories of India", "Members of the Lok Sabha", "Gujarati people", "Mandovi River", "Narendra Modi", "Modi", "Narendra Modi ministry", "Kalasa-Banduri Nala project", "Karnataka government", "Goa Governor", "Mahadayi", "CSIR-National Institute"], "tags": ["Politics"], "authors": ["Press Trust Of India"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Read more about Had met PM, done whatever I could on Mahadayi issue: Goa Guv on Business Standard.
