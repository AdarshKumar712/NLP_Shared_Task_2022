As I entered adulthood and had a home of my own, I opted to have a Christmas tree. After marrying a Jewish man and having children, I had to make a decision about the oft-predicted \u201cconfusion\u201d they might experience.\n\nWe continued to have a Christmas tree (and the belief in Santa) and used it as the \u201cteachable moment\u201d I think it can and should be. I explained to my children the meaning of Christmas for our Christian friends and their need to be respectful of its holy significance. Then I explained that Christmas is also a season with a spirit of family, friends, giving and sharing. As long as we respected the difference between spiritual symbols and secular symbols, there was no reason we could not share in the joy of this season.\n\nFrom my understanding, there is nothing religious about a Christmas tree, Santa Claus, family gatherings, supporting charities and exchanging gifts. I had this conversation regularly with my children throughout their childhood and teenage years.\n\nBringing our story up to the present, my children, both in their mid-20s, have strong, unconflicted Jewish identities. In fact, they are both young professionals working within the Jewish community, my son as a temple youth director and my daughter in Jewish philanthropy. I think this is the optimal win-win outcome.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Dec 26 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Readers discuss an Op-Ed article about a Jewish mother\u2019s qualms over having a Christmas tree in her home.
