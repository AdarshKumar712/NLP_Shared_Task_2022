I\u2019m not that dumb,\u201d Maldonado told parishioners.\n\nThe Miami Herald reported Maldonado also made an appeal to some of his congregation who feel apprehensive about attending Trump\u2019s Friday visit to the King Jesus International Ministry church because of his administration's increased immigration raids.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the president would do such a thing,\u201d Maldonado said. \u201cDon\u2019t put your race or your nationality over being a Christian. Be mature ... If you want to come, do it for your pastor. That\u2019s a way of supporting me.\u201d\n\nThe church in West Kendall south of Miami was chosen by Trump to host about 70 Christian pastors during an event billed as an \u201c\u2018Evangelicals for Trump\u2019 Coalition Launch.\u201d\n\nMaldonado asked churchgoers from Venezuela and Cuba to raise their hands, and emphasized his own opposition to communist dictatorships, something Trump has also done at public rallies in South Florida as an appeal to Hispanic voters.\n\nThe pastor said the church isn't organizing or financing the event, and that anyone seeking to attend the campaign rally had to pre-register at DonaldJTrump.com.\n\nOn Sunday, Secret Service agents were examining bags before the services, to prepare for the event. Every other church service during the week, except for a New Year\u2019s Eve mass, is being canceled, Maldonado said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["megachurch", "U.S.", "Miami", "Spanish", "church", "church", "church", "south", "West Kendall", "South Florida", "Cuba", "Venezuela", "church", "King Jesus International Ministry", "Miami Herald", "Secret Service", "dictatorships", "Evangelicals for Trump' Coalition Launch", "rally", "risk deportation", "visit", "campaign rally", "immigration raids", "race", "rallies", "event", "event", "event", "New Year's Eve", "Donald Trump", "service", "language", "hundreds", "something", "way", "immigration policy", "immigration papers", "thing", "appeal", "some", "nationality", "appeal", "services", "church service", "mass", "something", "opposition", "hands", "Donald Trump", "Miami", "President Trump"], "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Miami Dolphins", "Miami", "President Trump"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Dec 30 08:45:28 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The pastor of a Miami megachurch that will host President Donald Trump at a rally this week is guaranteeing that parishioners who entered the U.S. illegally won\u2019t risk deportation by attending.
