the People Act, 1951, will have to submit an application to the Election Commission of India (ECI) within a period of 30 days following the date of their formation, as per the new guidelines effective from Wednesday.\n\nThe new guidelines were framed by the ECI in the beginning of December last year with an aim to create a transparent system under the Political Parties Registration Tracking Management System (PPRTMS) so that the information is made available for the general public.\n\nAs per the guidelines prescribed by the ECI in the exercise of powers conferred by Article 324 of the Constitution of India and Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, \u201can association seeking registration has to submit an application to the Commission within a period of 30 days following the date of its formation.\u201d\n\nRegistration of political parties is governed by the provisions of Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.\n\n\u201cThe new guidelines are effective from January 1, 2020, and are available on the Commission\u2019s website http://eci.gov.in.,\u201d the ECI said.\n\nIn order to enable applicants to track the status of their applications, the Commission has launched the PPRTMS.\n\nThe salient feature in the PPRTMS is that the applicant, who is applying for party registration from January 1, 2020, will be able to track the progress of his or her application and will get status updates through SMS and e-mail, the ECI said.\n\n\u201cThe status can be tracked through the Commission\u2019s portal via the link https://pprtms.eci.gov.in,\u201d it said.\n\nIn December last year, the ECI had amended the guidelines and issued a press note dated December 2 regarding registration of political parties for the information of the general public.\n\n\u2013IANS\n\nrak/arm", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["effective", "parties", "wednesday", "guidelines", "political"], "authors": ["Canindia New
