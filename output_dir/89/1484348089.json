It\u2019s not unusual for companies to take a go-slow approach after a big expenditure year. Adobe and Oracle bought just two companies each with neither revealing the prices. IBM didn\u2019t buy any.\n\nMicrosoft didn\u2019t show up on this year\u2019s list either, but still managed to pick up eight new companies. It was just that none was large enough to make the list (or even for them to publicly reveal the prices). When a publicly traded company doesn\u2019t reveal the price, it usually means that it didn\u2019t reach the threshold of being material to the company\u2019s results.\n\nAs always, just because you buy it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always going to integrate smoothly or well, and we won\u2019t know about the success or failure of these transactions for some years to come.
