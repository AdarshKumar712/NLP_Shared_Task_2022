Although the outcome is nearly certain\u2014there aren\u2019t enough Senate votes to remove the president from office\u2014the issue will steal the air from other issues until the trial is concluded.\n\nPost-trial, here are some issues likely to dominate 2020. Each represents a fork in the road, and the direction the nation chooses will be critical.\n\n\u2022 Immigration: Trump could roll out a new immigration plan as we head toward the elections. In addition to trying to secure more funding for desperately needed border security, a part of the plan could include another attempt at creating a merit-based legal immigration system, rather than one that\u2019s based primarily on family ties.\n\nA system that favors applicants with desirable job skills would shift legal immigration\u2019s focus from being centered on the desires of immigrants to being centered on the needs of the American people and our economy.\n\nA merit-based system also more easily allows \u201cpatriotic assimilation,\u201d creating a more unified nation, rather than one divided into special-interest groups based on where we came from.\n\n\u2022 Election integrity: With the 2020 elections coming, citizens must be assured that the electoral process for federal, state and local elections is fair.\n\nAlthough many on the left deny it, voter fraud exists. Even the U.S. Supreme Court has noted that voter fraud is a clearly documented part of our nation\u2019s history.\n\nUnfortunately, politicians and advocacy groups on the left continue to fight laws that require an ID to vote. They\u2019ve even sued states that have tried to purge voter rolls of people registered in multiple jurisdictions who could vote more than once in an election.\n\nMoreover, the push to eliminate the Electoral College would increase the influence of large urban centers at the expense of small states and rural areas, striking at our constitutional structure that balances the rule of the majority with protections for minority interests and state governments.\n\n\u2022 Education: Politicians have floated proposals of free college tuition for all and loan forgiveness for everyone carrying college debt.\n\nThey are characterized as \u201cinvestments in our future,\u201d but the reality is, they would be a suffocating financial burden on every taxpayer, especially middle- and lower-income citizens. There\u2019s also an inherent unfairness to forcing Americans who couldn\u2019t afford to go to college themselves to pay off the loans of those who could.\n\nOne also has to question what kind of return taxpayers would get for their \u201cinvestment.\u201d Many colleges are indoctrinating students into a socialist, \u201cAmerica is evil\u201d ideology, and often students graduate unprepared for a career and unable to pay off the enormous college debt they accumulated. Forty percent of those who start college don\u2019t even finish within six years.\n\nDespite these issues, because federal loan money is handed out with little scrutiny as to students\u2019 ability to pay it back, colleges have had free rein to raise prices at rates often double that of inflation. In addition, more than 1 million people default on their loans annually, leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab.\n\n\u201cFree\u201d college tuition would only make things worse.\n\n\u2022 China: Under the brutal governance of the Chinese Communist Party, China presents a combination of risks our nation has never before faced.\n\nChinese authorities direct attacks on our government cyber networks, steal the intellectual property of our companies, and threaten the travel of ships and planes in and over international waters.\n\nThe authoritarian regime is also spending enormous amounts of money to build up its offensive military machine.\n\nAs U.S. policymakers start to pay more attention to China\u2019s threats, we can expect to see more recommendations for rebuilding America\u2019s military to keep China\u2019s in check.\n\nMoreover, while the national security threat is very real, because so many raw materials and finished goods come from China, the U.S. will continue attempting to build more positive trade relations with the country.\n\nBesides being good for Americans economically, a better trade relationship also serves as a deterrent to Chinese aggression, since there\u2019s little incentive to attack a major market for its goods.\n\nWhat we do about any one of these issues in 2020\u2014China, electoral integrity, education, or immigration\u2014could represent a major turning point for America.\n\nFrom safeguarding the right to vote to protecting the nation from foreign aggression to deciding whether more taxpayer money is the solution to rising college debt, the new year will certainly provide several opportunities to make pivotal decisions about America\u2019s future.\n\nOriginally published by The Washington Times", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Kay C.
