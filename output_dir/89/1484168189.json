The predators of the police state wreaked havoc on our freedoms, our communities, and our lives. The government didn't listen to the citizenry, refused to abide by the Constitution, and treated the citizenry as a source of funding and little else.\n\nThe American President became more imperial. Although the Constitution invests the President with very specific, limited powers, in recent years, American presidents (Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc.) claimed the power to completely and almost unilaterally alter the landscape of this country for good or for ill.\n\nMilitarized police became a power unto themselves, 911 calls turned deadly, and traffic stops took a turn for the worse. Lacking in transparency and accountability, protected by the courts and legislators, and rife with misconduct, America's police forces became a growing menace to the citizenry and the rule of law.\n\nThe courts failed to uphold justice. A review of critical court rulings over the past two decades reveals a startling and steady trend towards pro-police state rulings by an institution concerned more with establishing order and protecting the ruling class and government agents than with upholding the rights enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nThe Surveillance State rendered Americans vulnerable to threats from government spies, police, hackers and power failures. On a daily basis, Americans have been made to relinquish the most intimate details of who we areour biological makeup, our genetic blueprints, and our biometrics (facial characteristics and structure, fingerprints, iris scans, etc.)in order to navigate an increasingly technologically-enabled world.\n\nThe cost of endless wars drove the nation deeper into debt. America's war spending has already bankrupted the nation to the tune of more than $20 trillion dollars. Policing the globe and waging endless wars abroad hasn't made Americaor the rest of the worldany safer, but it has made the military industrial complex rich at taxpayer expense. Meanwhile, America's infrastructure is falling apart.\n\nThe government waged war on military veterans. Large numbers of veterans have been treated like criminalstargeted for surveillance, censorship, threatened with incarceration or involuntary commitment, labeled as extremists and/or mentally ill, and stripped of their Second Amendment rights for daring to speak out against government misconduct.\n\nFree speech was dealt one knock-out punch after another. Protest laws, free speech zones, bubble zones, trespass zones, anti-bullying legislation, zero tolerance policies, hate crime laws, shadow banning on the Internet, and a host of other legalistic maladies dreamed up by politicians and prosecutors (and championed by those who want to suppress speech with which they might disagree) conspired to corrode our core freedoms, purportedly for our own good.\n\nThe government waged a renewed war on private property. At no point do you ever have any real ownership in anything other than the clothes on your back. Everything else can be seized by the government under one pretext or another (civil asset forfeiture, unpaid taxes, eminent domain, public interest, etc.).\n\nSchools became even more like prisons. So-called school \"safety\" policieswhich run the gamut from zero tolerance policies that punish all infractions harshly to surveillance cameras, metal detectors, random searches, drug-sniffing dogs, school-wide lockdowns, active-shooter drills and militarized police officershave turned schools into prisons and young people into prisoners.\n\nThe Deep State took over. The American system of representative government was overthrown by the Deep Statea.k.a. the police state a.k.a. the military/corporate industrial complexa profit-driven, militaristic shadow government that makes a mockery of elections and the entire concept of a representative government.\n\nThe takeaway: Everything the founders of this country feared has come to dominate in modern America. \"We the people\" have been saddled with a government that is no longer friendly to freedom and is working overtime to trample the Constitution underfoot and render the citizenry powerless in the face of the government's power grabs, corruption and abusive tactics.\n\nNo matter who sits in the White House, politics won't fix a system that is broken beyond repair.\n\nNext Page 1 | 2", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Freedom", "Freedoms", "Nullify Now", "Unconstitutional"], "tags": ["Unconstitutional", "Freedoms", "Nullify Now", "Freedom"], "authors": ["John Whitehead"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Article: Nullify Government Tyranny: In 2020, Harness the Power of Your Discontent - Twenty years into the 21st century, and what do we have to show for it?
