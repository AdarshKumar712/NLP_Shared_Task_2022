In the alternate ending, Joker kills Bruce as well.\n\n\"Originally, the ending in the hospital was different. He's in the hospital and he laughs, chuckles, and he says, \u2018I was just thinkin' of something funny'. What was supposed to happen was you flashed back to the death of Thomas and Martha Wayne, and it was him (Joker) killing Thomas and Martha Wayne and the boy was screaming and crying and he turned to walk away and he turned back, shrugged, and shot the kid. Credits,\" he said.\n\nSmith said he was told the ending by someone \"who works in the business\" and called it \"reliable information\". He said: \"It was too f***ing good not to share and I f***ing hope it's true\".\n\nThe Warner Bros. project has become the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time, and has crossed the $ 1 billion mark at the worldwide box office.
