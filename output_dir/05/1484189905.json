"text": "Taylor Swift and Ryan Seacrest seem to have jumped into a flame they weren\u2019t quite prepared to overtake. Amid Nicki Minaj\u2019s tweets, they\u2019ve somehow twisted her words. But fans and non-fans aren\u2019t standing for it.\n\nIn a previous Inquisitr article, it mentioned Nicki Minaj\u2018s VMAs rant and how some things may have been taken out of context. Well, it appears that several people were affected by Minaj\u2019s words \u2014 but not by what she said. Rather, it came indirectly because of who responded.\n\nOf course, it started with Taylor Swift\u2018s response to one of Nicki\u2019s tweets, as can be seen in the previous article. However, it progressed once Ryan Seacrest made a tweet about the topic. The on-air personality poorly worded a headline.\n\nThen, several Twitter users lit into the personality.\n\n@OnAirWithRyan wow Ryan U suck for this headline \u2014 Gladiator Goldwyn (@iMargo_CEO) July 21, 2015\n\n@OnAirWithRyan @taylorswift13 @NICKIMINAJ it\u2019s nice to see that you only report half the story, not to mention it\u2019s incorrect. \u2014 Sarah (@Petty_In_Pink) July 21, 2015\n\n@OnAirWithRyan @NICKIMINAJ said she loved Taylor back! Wyd making T the victim of this, you\u2019re intentionally missing the whole point smh \u2014 1D Updates (@1DWWATUpdates) July 21, 2015\n\n@OnAirWithRyan @taylorswift13 @NICKIMINAJ always thought you were one of the nice guys \u2014 Sam Elizabeth (@hxneydew) July 21, 2015\n\nAnd several others were directed at him. However, Taylor didn\u2019t escape the onslaught. Fans believe she wanted to make the topic about her, rather than focus on what Nicki\u2019s words suggested.\n\n@OnAirWithRyan @taylorswift13 @NICKIMINAJ This exactly what taylor wanted more news articles about her \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffb congrats taylor \ud83d\ude12 \u2014 wendy (@katycatwendy) July 21, 2015\n\n@OnAirWithRyan @taylorswift13 @NICKIMINAJ \u201cPoor innocent white woman VICTIMIZED by black woman\u2019s opinion having nothing to do with her!\u201d \u2014 Julian Burrell (@Julian_Burrell) July 21, 2015\n\n@OnAirWithRyan Taylor isn\u2019t a victim. Okay? She\u2019s not the one you need to rally around after this. \u2014 YourDadWantsToFave (@BertLoch) July 21, 2015\n\n@OnAirWithRyan THAT WASNT A JAB AT TAYLOR, WHY ARE YOU PRAISING TAYLOR FOR THINKING EVERYTHING IS ABOUT HER LMFAO BYE \u2014 m\u00f8m (@paulinaugh) July 21, 2015\n\nI\u2019m baffled as to WHY @taylorswift13 felt the need to come at @NickiMinaj for speaking on behalf of unsung black female entertainers.. \u2014 Elgin Charles (@ElginCharles) July 21, 2015\n\n.@taylorswift13 stop using \u201csupport all girls\u201d as an excuse to not be critical of racist media that benefits and glorifies you \u2014 berenice (@itsbereniced) July 21, 2015\n\nnicki was making valid points about the history of racism in the music industry, taylor should be standing by her not making it about her \u2014 becca (@margaerytyreII) July 21, 2015\n\nNicki Minaj responded to Ryan Seacrest\u2019s headline as well.\n\nNothing I said had to do with Taylor. So what jabs? White media and their tactics. So sad. That\u2019s what they want. https://t.co/AfcwoyDvpg \u2014 NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) July 21, 2015\n\nRyan posted a headline of Taylor saying she loves & supports me. But not me saying the same to her. Lol. Their headline says I took a \u201cjab\u201d? \u2014 NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) July 21, 2015\n\nI\u2019m so glad u guys get to see how this stuff works. Taylor took her music off spotify and was applauded. We launched Tidal & were dragged. \u2014 NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) July 21, 2015\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s difficult to recant statements after they\u2019ve been made, especially after people see those statements. This shows evident proof, does it not? What do you think about it all?\n\nDid they intentionally twist Nicki Minaj\u2019s words and switch the focus? Do you agree or disagree with the majority\u2019s thoughts about it all?
