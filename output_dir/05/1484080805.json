Epps. \u201cThe IRS should take appropriate action to remedy any violations that occurred or which continue to occur.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile leaders of churches or religious organizations may express their opinions on political matters as individuals, they are, according to this rule, precluded from making \u2018partisan comments in official organization publications or at official functions of the organization,\u2019\u201d she wrote.\n\nMarkert added that \u201cin urging congregants to come to a political rally, and in hosting the political rally,\u201d Pastor Guillermo Maldonado \u201cinappropriately used [his] religious organization and 501(c)(3) status by intervening in a political campaign.\u201d\n\nThe church, she asserted,\u201d violated IRS regulations by seemingly expressing its support for a candidate in the November 2020 presidential election.\u201d\n\nMaldonado, a Honduran evangelical pastor, invited his parishioners to the event which will include over 70 Evangelical leaders. He sought to quell fears raised by many of the church\u2019s members who are undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a citizen. And I will give you an affirmation as your spiritual father and your pastor,\u201d he said during a church service on Sunday, according to The Miami Herald. \u201cI ask you: Do you think I would do something where I would endanger my people? I\u2019m not that dumb.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the president would do such a thing,\u201d he told parishioners. \u201cDon\u2019t put your race or your nationality over being a Christian.
