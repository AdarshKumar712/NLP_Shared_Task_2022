No CIA-NGO attempt to overthrow anti-imperialist countries around the world is complete, without a few Nazis to lend an evil hand (https://chinarising.puntopress.com/2019/11/16/china-bolivia-and-venezuela-are-proof-that-social-democracy-cannot-thrive-in-the-global-capitalist-system-china-rising-radio-sinoland-191116/).\n\nIhor Maliar, Serhii Sternenko and Serhii Filimonov are well known members of the Ukrainian Nazi groups, Azov Battalion and Right Sektor. They wear swastikas, iron crosses and other Nazi symbols, including their ubiquitous tattoos, as caught on camera in Hong Kong above. Both of these two fascist groups are funded by the US National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and other CIA front NGOs (https://sputniknews.com/asia/201912021077466396-why-are-ukrainian-neo-nazis-joining-the-hong-kong-protests/).\n\nThis is a particularly revolting affront to the Chinese people, of whom 25-35 million died during World War II, in helping to defeat global fascism. Given this 20th century history, these Ukie goons were surely sent to Hong Kong to get a reaction out of Baba Beijing, which will not happen (https://chinarising.puntopress.com/2019/11/28/hong-kong-ensnared-in-the-wests-color-revolution-hot-box-the-latest-news-and-analysis-china-rising-radio-sinoland-191128/). These Nazis also created a color revolution Facebook group in Ukraine, called Free Hong Kong Center, as shown below. Sieg Heils, Herr CIA!\n\nWe can safely say that the CIA-NGO complex has connected their Hong Kong terrorists to Ukrainian Nazis to work together. I can't think of two groups that deserve each other more.\n\nThe Taiwan-HK color revolution nexus is no less obvious. Taiwanese \"tourists\" have been caught at the Hong Kong Airport, with suitcases full of masks, helmets and other terrorist weapons (https://youtu.be/10HaTxCrklU). Taiwan is offering sanctuary and support to Hong Kong subversives (https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/07/19/601315/Taiwan-Hong-Kong-protests-sanctuary). Treasonous leaders, like Joshua Wong, have flown to Taiwan, seeking help to destroy HK (http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aCS/201909030007.aspx).\n\nTaiwan is part of a continuous nexus of anti-socialist-communist China color revolutions going back to Tiananmen Square in 1989 (https://chinarising.puntopress.com/2019/05/30/over-100000-people-around-the-world-have-read-this-you-should-too-china-rising-radio-sinoland-190604/).\n\nDuring March 2014, in precision organized scenes eerily similar to Hong Kong's, and right on the heels of the bloody, US orchestrated overthrow of the pro-Russian government in Ukraine (Maidan), students stormed the Taiwanese legislature, occupying it to protest a proposed law to increase commerce with the Mainland. It became known as the Sunflower Movement and had all the hallmarks of a Western organized and financed color revolution. It so shook Taiwan and was such a huge loss of face for the pro-Beijing KMT Party, that it heavily lost later local and national elections, putting into power the US backed/manipulated, secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Since then, cross-strait relations have gone from positive and productive to sour and confrontational. Chalk up a temporary and futile victory for Western imperialism.\n\nFlash forward five years. When the Hong Kong color revolution terrorists stormed their legislature, they ransacked it, costing millions of dollars in damage, needing months of repairs. Not by coincidence, they painted in big Chinese-character graffiti,\n\nSunflower HK\n\nSeen in this photo below,\n\n\n\nThere are many similar examples. Here is a tweet from a HK NGO, also using the Taiwanese sunflower meme,\n\n(Image by China Rising website) Details DMCA\n\n\n\nNext Page 1 | 2", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["China", "Color Revolution", "Fascist", "Hong Kong", "NGOs"], "tags": ["Fascist", "NGOs", "Color Revolution", "Hong Kong", "China"], "authors": ["Jeff J.
