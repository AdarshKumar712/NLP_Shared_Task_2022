Disputes at the board level, an ill-advised, failed and expensive voluntary employee separation exercise coupled with dubious, secretive and convoluted agreements with both Shell North America and Wartsila have landed BPL in the state it is in today. Customers have had to suffer through unrelenting daily blackouts, excessively and redundantly high electricity costs and uncertainty, all at the bad hands of the FNM who made politically motivated decisions at BPL.\n\nThe public is well aware that the PLP opposed the FNM's version of the Rate Reduction Bond during the House debate because the government could not explain the cost and conditions of the bond. The PLP said it would not support this additional fee on BPL customers until the government could provide the public with this definitive information. To date, the FNM has failed to meet and satisfy this agreed condition but here we are with the imposition of this new fee, an additional cost on electricity without any update on the raising of the funds secured by the Rate Reduction Bonds. This is reckless and a wanton betrayal of the public trust.\n\nI again publicly call on the government to be accountable and transparent and publish the cost of the Rate Reduction Bond and the terms and conditions of the imposition of this new fee schedule. It is the right thing to do. It's in the public interest.\n\nOverall, the FNM must accept full responsibility for all of its actions, poor decisions and the lack of public confidence in this beleaguered public Corporation.\n\nThis nightmare began in ernest shortly after the FNM assumed management control of BPL in May 2017.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Buddy Hield", "Traveling", "World", "Sport", "Food", "Music", "Politics", "Fashion", "All", "Lifestyle", "Basketball", "big", "Sports", "New"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.bahamasnational.com/misc/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"title": "Leader of the PLP and Opposition spokesman on electricity and energy matters", "description": "The PLP wishes to respond to a statement released by the Bahamas Power and Light on the National Utility Investment Charge (NUIC).In classic FNM style, this administration continues to blame everybody else for their incompetence and errors while refusing to accept responsibility for their poor policy decisions.The specific charges of \"ill-advised decision making\" and \"misplaced priorities by previous management\" are totally false, baseless, without merit and a continuation of the FNM's deceitful and shamefull narrative of blame the PLP.The", "image": "http://www.bahamasnational.com/sites/default/files/Brave-Davis.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "http://www.bahamasnational.com/content/leader-plp-and-opposition-spokesman-electricity-and-energy-matters"}
