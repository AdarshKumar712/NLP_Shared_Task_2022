LLUIS GENE (AFP)\n\nDe Jong the best signing, Ter Stegen takes top spot\n\nFrenkie de Jong has been deemed the Catalans' most successful new recruit this term, coming third in the standings behind only Lionel Messi and Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen, with the goalkeeper actually beating the Argentine into second place.\n\nThe top three are followed by Gerard Piqu\u00e9, Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet, Ivan Rakitic, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Arturo Vidal. The high marks given to Rakitic and Vidal are particularly noteworthy, given the difficulties they have both had in getting game time.\n\nBarcelona squad - pass/fail rankings:\n\n1.
