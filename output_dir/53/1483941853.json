Thousands of people packed Saint Peter\u2019s Square to hear his word on World Peace Day. The pope also used strong words during a morning mass in the Vatican Basilica to decry violence against women and called for an end to the exploitation of the female body.\n\nUnder a brilliant winter sun and blue sky, Pope Francis wished a huge crowd gathered in Saint Peter\u2019s Square a happy new year of peace. The pope said it is not expected that our planet has begun a new circle around the sun and that humanity continues to live in it but rather it is always a miracle that surprises and that one should be thankful for.\n\n\n\nPope Francis leads the Angelus prayer as the Roman Catholic Church marks its World Day of Peace at the Vatican, Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nOn World Peace Day, instituted by Pope Paul VI, Pope Francis said that for 2020 the message is this: \u201cPeace is a path of hope, a path on which one advances through dialogue, reconciliation and conversion.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier Pope Francis celebrated a solemn mass on New Year\u2019s Day in Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica. On January 1, the Church celebrates Mary, mother of Jesus.\n\n\n\nIn his first homily of 2020, the pope spoke against violence inflicted on women in modern society. He said all violence against women is a desecration of God. He also called for an end to the exploitation of the female body saying it \u201cmust be freed from consumerism\u201d and it \u201cmust be respected and honored.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said \u201chow often is a woman's body sacrificed on the profane altar of advertising, profit, pornography, exploited as a surface to be used.\u201d He added that while women are \u201cthe sources of life,\u201d they are continually offended, beaten, raped, forced into prostitution\" or forced to have abortions.\n\n\n\nPope Francis said that our level of humanity is understood by the way we treat a woman's body. He also said that in order to make the world more united and at peace, women should become fully-associated with decision-making.\n\n\n\nIn his homily, the pope also addressed the issue of immigration and mothers who undertake difficult voyages to improve the lives of their children.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are mothers, who risk perilous journeys to desperately try to give the fruit of the womb a better future and are judged to be redundant by people whose bellies are full of things, but whose hearts are empty of love.\"\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Sabina Castelfranco", "Associated Press", "Written By"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Pope Francis wished for peace in the world at the start of the New Year.
