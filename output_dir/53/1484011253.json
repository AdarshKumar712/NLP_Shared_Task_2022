lauramusikanski/morguefile\n\nOne small word encompasses a big shift in thinking that can help people become unstuck. That word\u2014probably the favorite word of clinical psychologists and other mental health professionals\u2014is \u201cand.\u201d Here are some examples of how you can use it to deepen your understanding and think more flexibly about your circumstances.\n\nYour perspective and their perspective\n\nIn conflicts, people often waste a lot of time and energy arguing about who is right or wrong. This tends to go nowhere. A more useful approach is to recognize that different people have different perspectives, all of which can be valid, even if they contradict one another.\n\nThis use of \u201cand\u201d recognizes that we can understand and respect someone else\u2019s perspective, even if we don\u2019t agree with it. For example, we can acknowledge, \u201cI would never deliberately try to hurt you and my actions did hurt you\u201d or \u201cI like to be spontaneous and you prefer to make plans.\u201d When we move past right or wrong toward empathy and respect, we\u2019re in a better place to move forward together.\n\nHappy and sad\n\nLife is complicated. Few choices or situations are 100 percent positive, so our feelings in response to them tend to be more like patchwork quilts than whole-cloth blankets.\n\nThis use of \u201cand\u201d acknowledges ambivalence and allows us to have a deeper understanding of our emotional lives. We don\u2019t have to pick one emotion; we can experience and embrace all of them, even at the same time. We can be happy about a big change and sad about leaving what we had before. We can be excited and worried, hurt and angry, disappointed and relieved. Recognizing our multifaceted emotional reactions allows us to choose wisely about how we\u2019ll respond and take better care of ourselves.\n\nThen and now\n\nStatements along the lines of \u201cI\u2019ve always\u2026\u201d or \u201cI never\u2026\u201d suggest that we have only one way of doing things, which is the way we\u2019ve done them before. But psychotherapy\u2014and life\u2014are fundamentally about change.\n\nThis use of \u201cand\u201d recognizes our patterns and habits, and it also creates room for us to move in new directions. What came before matters. That\u2019s what created our expectations and assumptions. That\u2019s what led up to who we are today. We can accept our past and also commit to creating ourselves anew each day. Maybe in an old relationship, you responded one way and now you want to react a different way. Maybe in the past, it was hard for you to do something and now you are better equipped to handle it. Maybe you\u2019ve been scared and now you\u2019re willing to move forward even though you\u2019re scared.\n\nEmbracing the word \u201cand\u201d is about cultivating openness, seeing nuance, and acknowledging possibility. \u201cAnd\u201d can give us hope.\n\nRelated posts:\n\n\u00a92019 Eileen Kennedy-Moore, Ph.D.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Embracing this word opens you to deeper understanding and mental flexibility.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "Embracing this word opens you to deeper understanding and mental flexibility.", "fb": {"app_id": 220580041311284}, "og": {"site_name": "Psychology Today", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/growing-friendships/201912/what-is-psychologists-favorite-word", "title": "What Is Psychologists\u2019 Favorite Word?", "description": "Embracing this word opens you to deeper understanding and mental flexibility.", "image": "https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/styles/manual_crop_1_91_1_1528x800/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2019-12/shutterstock_1025566348.jpg?itok=13HRccMR"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Embracing this word opens you to deeper understanding and mental flexibility.", "site": "@PsychToday", "title": "What Is Psychologists\u2019 Favorite Word?", "creator": {"identifier": "@psychtoday", "id": 27726303}, "url": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/growing-friendships/201912/what-is-psychologists-favorite-word", "image": "https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/styles/manual_crop_1_91_1_1528x800/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2019-12/shutterstock_1025566348.jpg?itok=13HRccMR"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "theme-color": "#F2F2F2", "alexaVerifyID": "ruuD3Gzrr-EaY185APFbxF69Va4", "google-site-verification": "G-wasBQCXXJoehIaVW5BsO9VYKt4oqmWGo155wSSakQ", "y_key": "0f29d521db0a2863", "msvalidate.01": "9AD6650A37790044983CFB6B27D77607", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Psych Today"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/growing-friendships/201912/what-is-psychologists-favorite-word"}
