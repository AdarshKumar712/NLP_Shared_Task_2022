Marvel and DC have had multiverses both big and small, and 'what if' stories abound. Some of these alternate takes on classic characters even become icons in and of themselves. Soviet Superman from Superman: Red Son, Thomas Wayne Batman from Flashpoint and -- potentially the most popular -- Miles Morales from the now-defunct Ultimate Marvel Universe.\n\nWhile many of those alternates are short-lived, some of them still manage to capture the imagination. This is definitely the case for the terrifying the Harli-Quinnitor from Dial H for Hero #10.\n\nContinue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view.\n\nRELATED: Transformers and Nina Turtles Just Sneaked Into the DC Universe (Kinda)\n\nAs a sort of cultural icon and staple Halloween costume, Harley Quinn likely needs very little in the way of an introduction. She is a frequent accomplice of the Joker who was originally introduced in the superb episode, Mad Love, of Paul Dini's The New Batman Adventures. She's a wise-cracking bad-ass with a whole array of comically large weaponry and iconic costumes.\n\nThe other half of this new character, however, may need slightly more explanation. This other piece of this puzzle, for those unfamiliar, is the Anti-Monitor, whose very existence is tied to the nature of the DCU. In order to make a long story short; in the DCU there is both positive and anti-matter. Because of this there are two beings, sons of the super-celestial Perpetua, referred to as the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor. They are beings of immense power, and the darker half of the pair -- the Anti-Monitor -- poses a threat to all of existence. For a laugh, Sam Humphries has decided to combine the world-ending power of the Anti-Monitor with the hilarious and violent nihilism of a character that he has first-hand experience writing, Harley Quinn.\n\nRELATED: How The New 52 Kept Us From Justice League/Transformers\n\nIt's on this quest that Sam Humphries and Co. bring fans to a universe of combined characters. The heroes of this world include Disco Troy, Starborg, Super-Martian, Wonderhawk and in mix-ups with our two lead characters, Lobo Kick You and Miguel the Street, who is a sentient street capable of teleporting to wherever they're needed. All of these combo heroes are working together to take down the gigantic armored and awesome monstrosity that is the Harli-Quinnitor. The gigantic foe features all of the power of the Anti-Monitor and all of the 'puddins' of the Joker's sometimes lover.\n\nWhile the main story has little to do with The Harli-Quinnitor, she does a fair amount of show-stealing. As everything with Miguel and Mister Thunderbolt is playing out, the character who is officially the greatest mash-up that we didn't know we needed is laying waste to the combined city of Gothamopolis in a scene of destruction. Cars are stomped, buildings are cut in half by The Harli-Quinnitors massive red and black fists and as the issue is coming to a close, the villain strikes a pose that is reminiscent of Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still and blasts the world of combined heroes apart.\n\nIt's not often in comics that the villains prevail, and while the true fate of this planet is still vague, as the main story whisks us away just as the Harli-Quinnitor fires its beam, it's hard not to root for the villain this time around.\n\nDial H for Hero #10 hits shelves in January of 2020.\n\nNEXT: Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey Celebrate 2020 with a Fantabulous New Trailer\n\nShare Tweet Email Copy Link Copied", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["harley quinn", "feature", "Dial H for Hero"], "authors": ["Sage Negron", "Caitlin Chappell", "Edoardo Ranaboldo", "Sam Stone"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 10:01:45 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "DC has decided to combine the world-ending power of the Anti-Monitor with the violent nihilism of Harley Quinn.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/public/build/images/favicon-32x32.8609a1c9.png", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "description": "DC has decided to combine the world-ending power of the Anti-Monitor with the violent nihilism of Harley Quinn.", "og": {"title": "Harley Quinn Just Became the Biggest Threat in the Multiverse", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/harley-quinn-feature.jpg", "width": 1400, "height": 700}, "url": "https://www.cbr.com/harley-quinn-biggest-threat-multiverse-anti-monitor/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "DC has decided to combine the world-ending power of the Anti-Monitor with the violent nihilism of Harley Quinn.", "site_name": "CBR"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T10:01:45Z", "section": "CBR Exclusives"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1754119328184357, "pages": 10765693196}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.cbr.com/harley-quinn-biggest-threat-multiverse-anti-monitor/"}
