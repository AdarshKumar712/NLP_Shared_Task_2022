The accused was nabbed when he was trying to escape after setting on fire the compact SUV car of the bhajan singer with the body of latter's son Bhagwat on the rear seat. Police have sent the boy's charred body to PGIMS, Rohtak, for forensic post-mortem to ascertain the cause of death.It is learnt that on being arrested, Himanshu tried to mislead the police about the body and murders. Ajay Pathak owed Himanshu Rs 60,000, and when Ajay did not settle the account, the latter murdered Ajay, his wife Sneh Lata Pathak (36) and daughter Vasundhara Pathak (12) with sharp-edged weapons. A murder case was registered at Shamli.\"During interrogation, Himanshu confessed to killing Bhagwat. The body's position indicates that the victim's hands may have been tied. The post-mortem report will reveal if the boy was first murdered then burnt or was burnt alive in the car,\" an official of Panipat police said. Panipat cops have handed Himanshu over to Karamvir Singh, SHO of Adarsh Nagar police station, for further proceedings.Bhajan singer Ajay Pathak, his wife and daughter were killed with sword at their home in Shamli town of Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday evening.
