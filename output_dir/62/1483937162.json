With the colder weather setting in, there are a couple of ways to help friends, neighbours or family.\n\nKnowing how to help isn\u2019t always easy, but there are a few ways to offer your support.\n\nReconnections is a free service that may be able to help someone you know connect to other people, places or activities near them.\n\nReconnections is accepting referrals for people over the age of 50 up until New Year\u2019s Eve 2019.\n\nYou can also make a difference yourself.\n\nStop and chat \u2013 a friendly hello and chat can go a long way. Let vulnerable people know that you would be available to help if they need you.\n\nKeep an eye out for winter illness \u2013 with temperatures lowering, the risk of illnesses in older people rises. If a friend or neighbour shows signs of being unwell, ask if there is a relative you could call or offer to call their doctor.\n\nHeating \u2013 checking that someone\u2019s heating supply is working properly can be invaluable and help prevent serious illnesses. Check they close their bedroom window at night, as breathing in cold air can increase the risk of chest infections.\n\nCouncillor John Smith, cabinet member with responsibility for Health and Wellbeing at Worcestershire County Council said, \u201cWe can all play a role in helping those around us. This is important throughout the year, but over Christmas and New Year many elderly people in our community will have an increased risk of illness and may feel isolated. Spending just a little time supporting elderly and vulnerable people in your life and making them feel valued can make all the difference.\u201d\n\nReconnections will continue to work with people aged over 55 years until March 2020. A new all age adult service will start in April 2020.\n\nYou can contact them on 01905 740954 or visit their website reconnectionsservice.org.uk", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 12:00:43 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "PEOPLE are being urged to check in with their elderly friends and neighbours over the Christmas period.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/resources/icon/", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "OMG-Verify-V1": "4389-366acdfc-5224-4c07-bb70-f74d8fbfc2db", "og": {"url": "https://www.malverngazette.co.uk/news/18131837.help-beat-loneliness-2020/", "site_name": "Malvern Gazette", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.malverngazette.co.uk/resources/images/9501464/", "width": 1500, "height": 1056}, "title": "Help beat loneliness in 2020", "type": "website", "name": "Help beat loneliness in 2020", "description": "PEOPLE are being urged to check in with their elderly friends and neighbours over the Christmas period."}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.malverngazette.co.uk/resources/images/9501464/"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Help beat loneliness in 2020", "description": "PEOPLE are being urged to check in with their elderly friends and neighbours over the Christmas period."}, "fb": {"app_id": 156334064425055, "pages": 327723024065323}, "medium": "news", "title": "Help beat loneliness in 2020", "description": "PEOPLE are being urged to check in with their elderly friends and neighbours over the Christmas period."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.malverngazette.co.uk/news/18131837.help-beat-loneliness-2020/"}
