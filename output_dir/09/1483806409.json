The aim of the list is to raise the bar on sustainability issues for all cities, said Claire Ellis, the chair of Ecotourism Australia, one of the organizations that helped determine the list.\n\nSlovenia, Dr. Ellis added, was among the first countries to develop sustainability tools and certification programs at the national level . In 2016 its capital, Ljubljana, was voted Europe\u2019s greenest city by the European Union, thanks to its public transport, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, and commitment to protecting green areas and saving waste water.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "If you want to see the world, but also make your trips more sustainable.
