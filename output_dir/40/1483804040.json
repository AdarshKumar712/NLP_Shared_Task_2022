I was raving about President Trump\u2019s booming economy and the fact that there\u2019s record employment numbers, wage gains for woman, people of color and blue-collar workers. The troll invoked their disgusting identity politics and reminded me that this was the Democrats\u2019 base. My response was: \u201cFantastic, perhaps they will finally realize that Republicans want them to succeed, Democrats only want their vote.\u201d To prove this point, just 6 months ago Democrats and their allies in the fake news media were hoping for a pre-election recession, a clear indicator that they\u2019re putting party before country.\n\nPutting party over country is exactly what New Hampshire\u2019s all-Democratic congressional delegation is doing. These partisans spent the whole year trying to reverse the will of the people with a Marxist-style un-American impeachment, totally absent of any sense of fairness. These partisans spent little to no time representing the people of New Hampshire. In November, we the people of New Hampshire have the chance to cast our own impeachment vote and remove Jeanne Shaheen, Annie Kuster and Chris Pappas from office and replace them with people who\u2019ll actually represent the people of New Hampshire and respect the will of the people.\n\nWith the scary clown car show crossing New Hampshire, we are getting a good look at how extreme their party is. In fact, the frontrunner, who thinks he is above the law, is so error prone that his campaign restricts his campaign appearances. No-show Joe often doesn\u2019t even know what state he\u2019s campaigning in.\n\nVAN MOSHER\n\nBow", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Bow NH", ""], "tags": ["Bow NH"], "authors": ["Leah Willingham -", "David Brooks -", "Michael Casey -", "Ray Duckler -"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:01:14 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "I was recently trolled in an online debate.
