One usually has to go to outlets like MSNBC and the Washington Post to find people on the right who will forcefully critique the president. But GOP consultant Stuart Stevens is not shy about criticizing the direction of the Republican Party under Trump, and a Post op-ed published on New Year\u2019s Day voices some of his complaints.\n\nStuart was a top strategist for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential bid, and he currently serves on a political action committee supporting Bill Weld\u2019s challenge to Trump in the GOP primary.\n\n\u201cTrump didn\u2019t hijack the GOP and bend it to his will,\u201d Stevens asserts. \u201cHe did something far easier: he looked at the party, saw its fault lines and then offered himself as a pure distillation of accumulated white grievance and anger. He bet that Republican voters didn\u2019t really care about free trade or mutual security, or about the environment or Europe, much less deficits. He rebranded kindness and compassion as \u2018PC\u2019 and elevated division and bigotry as the admirable goals of just being politically incorrect.\u201d\n\nTrump, according to Stevens, \u201cdidn\u2019t make Americans more racist; he just normalized the resentments that were simmering in many households. In short, he let a lot of long-suppressed demons out of the box.\u201d\n\nThe GOP, Stevens laments, \u201cstands for all the wrong things now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans are now officially the character doesn\u2019t count party, the personal responsibility just proves you have failed to blame-the-other- guy party, the deficit-doesn\u2019t-matter party, the Russia-is-our-ally-party, and the I\u2019m-right-and-you-are-human-scum party,\u201d Stevens observes. \u201cYes, it\u2019s President Trump\u2019s party now, but it stands only for what he has just tweeted.\u201d\n\nStevens laments that in 2020, he is pessimistic about the future of the GOP.\n\n\u201cThis impeachment moment and all that has led to it should signal a day of reckoning,\u201d Stevens writes. \u201cA party that has as its sole purpose the protection and promotion of its leader, whatever he thinks, is not on a sustainable path. Can anyone force a change? I\u2019m not optimistic.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Religious Right"], "authors": ["Alex Henderson"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 20:40:23 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet.org", "title": "GOP consultant says the Republican Party has reached a 'day of reckoning' as Trump consumes it whole", "url": "https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/gop-consultant-says-the-republican-party-has-reached-a-day-of-reckoning-as-trump-consumes-it-whole/", "type": "article", "description": "In much of the right-wing media \u2014 from Fox News to AM talk radio to Breitbart \u2014 conservative condemnation of President Donald Trump is in painfully short supply.
