People can achieve great things.\n\n\u201cThe next 10 years present us with one of our greatest tests \u2013 a decade of action to repair the Earth,\u201d he said.\n\nKensington Palace

from 2021, is open to individuals as well as communities and businesses.\n\nIt has the support of conservation campaigners, groups and scientists, including the veteran British natural history broadcaster Attenborough.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of the Moonshot can guide us today as we confront the serious challenges we face on Earth,\u201d Attenborough said in a film to mark the launch. \u201cThis year Prince William and a global alliance launch the most prestigious environment prize in history ... designed to motivate and inspire a new generation of thinkers, leaders and dreamers to think differently.\u201d\n\nBoth Prince Charles and Prince Philip have campaigned for environmental causes and against the illegal trade in wildlife around the world.\n\nWilliam is hoping to build on their work through the prize, which will initially be run by his and his wife\u2019s own charitable foundation.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Prince William", "Climate change", "UK news",
