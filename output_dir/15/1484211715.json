Jon Wall told WDIV-TV.\n\n\u201cHe heard what sounded like a car slamming on its brakes, which was squealing the tires, which alerted him to look into that particular direction,\u201d Wall said.\n\nThe SUV went up on a sidewalk before its driver put it in reverse and fled the scene. Police pursued the SUV and soon arrested the motorist.\n\nWalls said the suspect is facing several charges, including fleeing, resisting and obstructing.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Associated Press", "Ronnie Das"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 20:29:20 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "\u201cHe heard what sounded like a car slamming on its brakes, which was squealing the tires, which alerted him to look into that particular direction,\u201d Wall said.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.wlns.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2019/06/cropped-WLNS-Square-For-WP-site.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "\u201cHe heard what sounded like a car slamming on its brakes, which was squealing the tires, which alerted him to look into that particular direction,\u201d Wall said.", "google-site-verification": "COwXn1c5hAjHqrq8kwgvk6YmC1ZzCyOhdN9L_5ORhoE", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "fb": {"pages": 125810355649}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Michigan officer pushes 2 out of drunken motorist\u2019s path", "url": "https://www.wlns.com/news/michigan/michigan-officer-pushes-2-out-of-drunken-motorists-path/", "description": "\u201cHe heard what sounded like a car slamming on its brakes, which was squealing the tires, which alerted him to look into that particular direction,\u201d Wall said.", "site_name": "WLNS 6 News", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.wlns.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2019/11/police20lights_1560960355024.jpg_92934983_ver1.0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "secure_url": "https://www.wlns.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2019/11/police20lights_1560960355024.jpg_92934983_ver1.0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T20:29:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T20:30:31+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Michigan officer pushes 2 out of drunken motorist\u2019s path"}, "image": "https://www.wlns.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2019/11/police20lights_1560960355024.jpg_92934983_ver1.0.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Michigan officer pushes 2 out of drunken motorist\u2019s path", "description": "\u201cHe heard what sounded like a car slamming on its brakes, which was squealing the tires, which alerted him to look into that particular direction,\u201d Wall said."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.wlns.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2019/06/cropped-WLNS-Square-For-WP-site.png?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.wlns.com/news/michigan/michigan-officer-pushes-2-out-of-drunken-motorists-path/"}
