On St Stephen\u2019s Day, he described his achievements since assuming office 2\u00bd years ago.\n\nIt is one of a number of social media broadcasts and publications recently issued by Fine Gael, suggesting the party is upping the ante ahead of a general election, which is widely expected to take place in the spring.\n\nMinister for Climate Action Richard Bruton has also announced a raft of initiatives on waste, packaging and climate change in recent days.\n\nClimate change and the \u201cgreen agenda\u201d are expected to be major themes of the election campaign. Fine Gael, in particular, may be vulnerable to rising support for the Green Party in affluent urban areas, after that party\u2019s strong performance in the local and European elections and November\u2019s byelections.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Varadkar and Coveney promise \u2018record high\u2019 employment and 11,000 social housing units", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/assets/images/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "Varadkar and Coveney promise \u2018record high\u2019 employment and 11,000 social housing units", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14128388"}, "news_keywords": "News, Politics, Election2020", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "Taoiseach makes first general election campaign pitch in New Year video", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/taoiseach-makes-first-general-election-campaign-pitch-in-new-year-video-1.4128388", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "Varadkar and Coveney promise \u2018record high\u2019 employment and 11,000 social housing units", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4128387&origw=1440", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4128387&origw=1440", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimes", "creator": "@harrymcgee", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/taoiseach-makes-first-general-election-campaign-pitch-in-new-year-video-1.4128388", "title": "Taoiseach makes first general election campaign pitch in New Year video", "description": "Varadkar and Coveney promise \u2018record high\u2019 employment and 11,000 social housing units", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128387.1577905783!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/taoiseach-makes-first-general-election-campaign-pitch-in-new-year-video-1.4128388"}
