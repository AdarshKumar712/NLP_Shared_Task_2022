The documents, which purportedly fill 1,875 boxes and include 415 gigabytes of electronic records spanning Biden\u2019s time in Congress between 1973 through 2009, were to be made public on Dec. 31, 2019, according to an agreement the former vice president entered into with the University of Delaware in 2011 upon donating his papers to the institution. Those parameters, however, were changed on April 24\u2014the day before Biden declared his 2020 campaign\u2014\n\nDonald Trump Signs Law to End Rape Kit\n\nTesting Backlog 1 reply Posted by ladydawgfan \u2014 Post Reply President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed legislation aimed at ending the backlog of rape kits nationwide. Presently, at least 100,000 rape kits are untested in the U.S. and are likely to remain so without adequate funding to test DNA in a timely fashion. The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2019, named in honor of a 1989 rape victim whose evidence went untested until 1994, will help fund DNA test training as well as education programs. The law will also fund the Sexual Assault Forensic Exam Grant Program. \u201cThis legislation authorizes the Department of Justice to provide resources to State and local law enforcement to help make sure that criminals are brought to justice.\n\nWelcome to 2020, the Year of the Good Fight 1 reply Posted by ladydawgfan \u2014 Post Reply The year 2020 begins with incredible potential for supporters of President Donald Trump \u2014 and for America\u2019s renaissance. The economy is roaring. The country is about to sign trade deals with our North American partners and with China; another deal with a post-Brexit Great Britain is likely. The world is safer. ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead. The \u201cChristmas gift\u201d threatened by North Korea failed to materialize. Iran is using its proxies to attack the U.S. in Iraq \u2014 but the regime is facing new protests.\n\nDo You Want Venezuela for New Years 2020? 8 replies Posted by ladydawgfan \u2014 Post Reply As I write this column, just days before New Year 2020, we are all being bombarded by great news about the US economy under President Trump. It just doesn\u2019t get any better than this. NASDAQ just hit 11,000 for the first time in history. It\u2019s up a remarkable 11 days in a row. The Dow and S&P also hit new highs. We just received fresh confirmation from China that the phase one trade deal is close to being signed. We also found out global stock markets- led almost entirely by the US stock market- gained $17 trillion in wealth in 2019. The entire world is getting rich because of President Trump\n\nNasty Nancy, Shifty Schiff, and Schumer\n\nsubvert the Constitution to damage Trump 21 replies Posted by ladydawgfan \u2014 Post Reply Nancy Pelosi, AKA Nasty Nancy, allowed Adam Schiff, AKA Shifty Schiff, to run the impeachment \"inquiry\" through Shifty's Intelligence Committee, where Shifty had total control. He set the rules to allow only the witnesses he wanted. He lied in his opening statement to commence the inquiry by making up President Trump's phone conversation with Ukraine's President Zelensky. The resulting vote to impeach was a foregone conclusion regardless of the evidence, or lack thereof. Pelosi has not sent Shifty's articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial because she said she wants to first see the Senate trial procedures.\n\nBen Rhodes still at it, defending his Iran deal...\n\nand gets a smack-down 11 replies Posted by ladydawgfan \u2014 Post Reply The Iran deal is a disaster, and every day it gets more and more obvious. Iran's mullahs have no intention of stopping their quest for a nuclear bomb. Less than two weeks ago, Iran's president told a group of Iranian expats in Kuala Lumpur that they were violating the whole thing: Iran President Hassan Rouhani said his country is working on the development of new, advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges, according to Iranian state-run news agency IRNA, a move that appears to violate the landmark nuclear agreement Tehran signed with world powers in 2015. Rouhani said at a meeting with Iranian expatriates in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday\n\nDemocrat Admits Impeachment \u2018Genesis\u2019 Was\n\nBefore Trump\u2019s Election 13 replies Posted by ladydawgfan \u2014 Post Reply [Video] Appearing Monday on MSNBC\u2019s All In, Rep. Al Green (D-TX) admitted the \u201cgenesis\u201d of impeachment was birthed during then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign for the presidency. (Watch from 1:58) A partial transcript is as follows: CHRISTOPHER HAYES: You just mentioned political expediency and insincerity. Those are two charges that have been leveled against Democrats during this entire affair, particularly when the formal impeachment inquiry. You played a starring role in those charges. The argument goes like this of how House Republicans and Trump, the president and his allies, is basically the Democrats wanted to impeach Donald Trump from day one,\n\nWall Street Boom in 2019: S&P 500, Nasdaq\n\nHave Best Year Since 2013 5 replies Posted by ladydawgfan \u2014 Post Reply Wall Street closed the books Tuesday on a blockbuster 2019 for stock investors, with the broader market delivering its best returns in six years. The S&P 500 finished with a gain of 28.9% for the year, its best annual performance since 2013, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 22.3%, led by Apple. Technology stocks led the way higher, vaulting 48%. That helped power the Nasdaq composite to a 35.3% gain for the year. Along the way, the three major indexes set more record highs than in 2018 and kept the longest bull market for stocks going.\n\nExclusive: Trump list shows 319 'results' and\n\npromises kept in three years 3 replies Posted by ladydawgfan \u2014 Post Reply One month shy of completing three years in office, President Trump has fulfilled or is making significant progress on most of his 2016 campaign promises, which aides said give him a strong reelection argument to counter his impeachment by a bitterly partisan House last week. As the president and his team ready for the 2020 campaign at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, officials said it would be built on the administration's achievements list of 15 categories and 319 \u201cresults.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence told Secrets that the message is simple: \u201cPromises made, promises kept.\u201d Pence, who has already hit the campaign trail in a specially outfitted Trump-Pence bus, added,\n\nNew census numbers undercut 'ascendant\n\nAmerica' theory 6 replies Posted by ladydawgfan \u2014 Post Reply From the first years of a century already one-fifth completed, we\u2019ve been told that a new, ascendant America \u2014 more nonwhite, more culturally liberal, more feminist \u2014 was going to dominate our politics for years to come. Those predictions have, partially, come true. Barack Obama was elected and reelected president in 2008 and 2012, and Democrats won majorities in House contests in 2006, 2008, and 2018. But those are slimmer pickings than the emerging majorities were promised. And President Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 has made a mockery of the predictions.\n\nEx-Trans Man Reverses 'Non-Binary' Sex\n\nDesignation in Blow to LGBT Movement 19 replies Posted by ladydawgfan \u2014 Post Reply This month, the first person to obtain a legal \"non-binary\" sex designation has successfully petitioned the court originally responsible for his \"non-binary\" status to order that the sex on his birth certificate be restored to \"male.\" In documents exclusively provided to PJ Media, James Shupe's petition described his \"non-binary\" designation as a \"psychologically harmful legal fiction.\" He told PJ Media he hopes this decision will prevent a woman currently seeking \"non-binary\" recognition from following the same lies. \"The charade of not being male, the legal fiction, it's over,\" James Shupe told PJ Media on Tuesday. \"The lies behind my fictitious sex changes, something I shamefully participated in, first to female,", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Monica Showalter", "Haris Alic", "Joshua Caplan", "Joel B.
