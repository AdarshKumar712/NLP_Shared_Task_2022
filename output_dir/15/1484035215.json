Under such conditions, Kim said, there is no reason for Pyongyang to remain \u201cunilaterally bound to the commitment any longer.\u201d\n\nKim did not go so far as to say that he was ditching nuclear negotiations with the U.S., which have stalled since 2018 when Trump and Kim made vague promises to work toward denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula during a summit in Singapore. But Kim \u201cconfirmed that the world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by [North Korea] in the near future,\u201d KCNA reported, without elaborating on the type of weapon it would be.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a man of his word,\u201d Trump says of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pic.twitter.com/bYQLXeBYPA \u2014 QuickTake by Bloomberg (@QuickTake) January 1, 2020\n\nAsked about Kim\u2019s strong rhetoric at a New Year\u2019s Eve bash held at Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s Palm Beach resort, on Tuesday night, the president said only that he and Kim \u201cget along\u201d and had come to certain agreements in Singapore.\n\n\u201cHe likes me, I like him, we get along,\u201d Trump said when asked about Kim\u2019s remarks from earlier in the day. Pyongyang is 14 hours ahead of Palm Beach.\n\n\u201cHe did sign a contract, he did sign an agreement talking about denuclearization. ... That was done in Singapore, and I think he\u2019s a man of his word, so we\u2019re going to find out, but I think he\u2019s a man of his word,\u201d Trump continued.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CBS News earlier in the day that it would be \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d if Kim \u201creneged on the commitments he made to President Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe made those commitments to President Trump in exchange for President Trump agreeing not to conduct large-scale military exercises,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived up to our commitments. We continue to hold out hope that he will live up to his as well.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Donald Trump", "North Korea", "Kim Jong Un", "Nuclear Weapons"], "tags": ["Kim Jong Un", "SHOPPING", "Social Justice", "HuffPost Press Room", "2020 Election", "What's Working: Purpose + Profit", "Donald Trump", "Extremism", "North Korea", "Impact: This New World", "Finds", "Impact: Project Zero", "Podcasts", "Nuclear Weapons", "Congress"], "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 08:33:18 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The North Korean leader signaled Wednesday that his country could soon resume nuclear weapons testing.
