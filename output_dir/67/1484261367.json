REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo Reuters\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will lead a group of U.S. officials who will attend the World Economic Forum later this month in Davos, Switzerland, the White House said Wednesday.\n\nMnuchin will be joined by officials including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House senior advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.\n\nAlso attending will be Keith Krach, a State Department under secretary for growth, energy and the environment, and Christopher Liddell, a White House deputy chief of staff.\n\nReuters reported on Dec. 17 that President Donald Trump planned to attend the annual Davos economic forum, citing a source familiar with the plan. [nL1N28R10N] A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday that Trump is still expected to attend at this time.\n\nIn 2019, Trump had to cancel his plan to attend the annual gathering of global economic and world leaders due to a government shutdown. He attended the Davos forum in 2018.\n\nThe World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort town is scheduled to run Jan. 21-24.\n\nEvents in Congress could affect the Republican president's attendance at the event.\n\nTrump, who became the third American president to be impeached on Dec. 18, faces a trial on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress once House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, sends the charges - called articles of impeachment - to the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nA dispute between Pelosi and Senate Leader Mitch McConnell over how the trial will be conducted arose after the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives impeached Trump.\n\n(This story corrects surname of U.S. Treasury Secretary in headline and second paragraph.)\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Collections: Business", "Investing News"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "US News is a recognized leader in college, grad school, hospital, mutual fund, and car rankings.
