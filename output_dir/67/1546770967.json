Vivo's previous Apex concept smartphones have been impressive tech showcases.\n\nThe first Apex concept in early 2018 presented a nearly bezel-less phone with the first in-display fingerprint scanner. Last year, the Apex 2019 had a fingerprint scanner that worked from anywhere within the display and a body without any holes.\n\nThe invite teasing the launch of the third-generation Vivo Apex concept smartphone was shared by Tech Sina.\n\nVivo arrived in Barcelona last year with the Apex 2019. It wasn't as impressive as the previous APEX smartphone.\n\nThe concept showed how a under-display fingerprint sensor could recognise your finger anywhere on the display. Instead of just in a small spot at the bottom of the display.\n\nVivo Sends Out MWC 2020 Invites, February 23 Launch Event Confirmed", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["vivo apex 3rd gen concept mwc 2020 launch vivo apex 2020", "vivo apex 2020 launch", "mwc", "mwc 2020", "vivo"], "tags": ["Vivo Apex 2020", "MWC 2020", "Vivo", "Vivo Apex 2020 Launch", "MWC"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "This makes it the third year that Vivo has showcased an Apex concept phone at the event.
