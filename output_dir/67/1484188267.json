Mandatory Credit: Alonzo Adams-USA TODAY Sports\n\nChris Paul scored 17 points \u2014 including 13 in the final 4:31 \u2014 to lead the Oklahoma City Thunder to a come-from-behind, 106-101 home win over the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night.\n\nWith less than three minutes remaining, the Thunder trailed by seven.\n\nBut then Oklahoma City reeled off a 14-2 run \u2014 fueled in large part by Paul \u2014 to end the game.\n\nThe win was the third in a row and seventh in the last eight games for the Thunder.\n\nDallas had a chance to regain the lead in the final minute, but Danilo Gallinari tipped the ball away from the Mavericks\u2019 Luka Doncic right into the arms of the Thunder\u2019s Steven Adams.\n\nOklahoma City converted at the free-throw line to put the game away.\n\nTwo players who were questionable going into the day \u2014 Gallinari and Dennis Schroder \u2014 led the Thunder with 20 points each.\n\nGallinari returned after missing four games due to ankle soreness. Schroder missed Sunday\u2019s game because of ankle soreness.\n\nDoncic scored 35 points to lead all scorers but struggled from behind the arc, going just 3 of 16 on 3-point attempts. He was 9 of 13 from inside the arc. Doncic added 10 rebounds and seven assists.\n\nDoncic dominated at the start, scoring 17 first-quarter points to help the Mavericks build a 12-point lead 12 minutes into the game.\n\nThe Thunder closed the first half with a 10-2 run to cut the deficit to one going into the half.\n\nThree Oklahoma City players produced double-doubles. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 19 points and 10 rebounds, Nerlens Noel had 12 points and 12 rebounds, and Adams had 10 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nThe loss was the second in a row for the Mavericks, who were without Kristaps Porzingis for just the second time this season. He was a late scratch due to right knee soreness.\n\nSlideshow (37 Images)\n\nThe Mavericks were also without Tim Hardaway Jr., who missed the game after sustaining a hamstring injury early in a Sunday road loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nOklahoma City\u2019s Hamidou Diallo played for the first time since Nov. 22. He missed 17 games due to a hyperextended right elbow. Diallo played 19 minutes and scored four points.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["BASKETBALL", "NBA", "OKC", "DAL", "Sport", "Basketball", "NBA Basketball"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Field Level Media", "Min Read"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 06:50:13 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "EditorsNote: fixes \"Luka\" in fifth graf", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/favicon/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "usNBA", "DCSext.ChannelList": "basketball-nba;everythingNews", "description": "EditorsNote: fixes \"Luka\" in fifth graf", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "BASKETBALL,NBA,OKC,DAL,Sport,Basketball,NBA Basketball", "news_keywords": "BASKETBALL;NBA;OKC;DAL;Sport;Basketball;NBA Basketball", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Jan 01 06:50:13 UTC 2020", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2020-01-01T06:50:13+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/basketball-nba-okc-dal-idUSMTZXEG11ETDGR2", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Paul rallies Thunder over Mavs for 3rd straight win", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "BASKETBALL,NBA,OKC,DAL,Sport,Basketball,NBA Basketball", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "BASKETBALL-NBA-OKC-DAL", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "Slideshow", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Paul rallies Thunder over Mavs for 3rd straight win", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-01T06:50:13+0000", "sailthru.title": "Paul rallies Thunder over Mavs for 3rd straight win", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Paul rallies Thunder over Mavs for 3rd straight win", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/basketball-nba-okc-dal-idUSMTZXEG11ETDGR2", "type": "article", "description": "EditorsNote: fixes \"Luka\" in fifth graf", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200101&t=2&i=1470682294&w=1200&r=MTZXEG11EIQ6CS", "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T06:50:13+0000", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T06:50:13+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "BASKETBALL,NBA,OKC,DAL,Sport,Basketball,NBA Basketball"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Paul rallies Thunder over Mavs for 3rd straight win", "description": "EditorsNote: fixes \"Luka\" in fifth graf", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200101&t=2&i=1470682294&w=1200&r=MTZXEG11EIQ6CS", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200101&t=2&i=1470682294&w=1200&r=MTZXEG11EIQ6CS"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/sports/nba/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/basketball-nba-okc-dal-idUSMTZXEG11ETDGR2"}
