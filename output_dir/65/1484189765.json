Sex biases in coresident kin can vary according to the scale of analysis (household vs. house cluster vs. village) and change across the life span, with women often living with more kin later in life. Headmen in large villages live with more close kin, primarily siblings, than do nonheadmen. Importantly, human marriage exchange and residence patterns create meta-group social structures, with alliances extending across multiple villages often united in competition against other large alliances at scales unparalleled by other species.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Robert S.", "Stephen", "Mark V.", "Michael", "Chris R.", "Von Rueden", "Karen L.", "Russell D.", "Lorena", "Diego"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"pbContext": ";journal:journal:ca;page:string:Article/Chapter View;subPage:string:Abstract;article:article:10.1086/668867;pageGroup:string:Publication Pages;website:website:uchicago;wgroup:string:ucpsites;issue:issue:10.1086/668648", "dc.Title": "Living with Kin in Lowland Horticultural Societies", "citation_journal_title": "Current Anthropology", "dc.Creator": "Kim R.
