The LAPD did not elaborate on the extra security measures.\n\n\u201cThe LAPD stands with members of our Jewish community,\u201d Moore tweeted. \u201cThere is no place for hate in Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nThe stabbings happened on the seventh night of Hanukkah, which the victims had been celebrating in the rabbi\u2019s home north of New York City. One person was seriously wounded and is in critical condition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt follows a series of attacks targeting Jews in the region, including a shooting at a kosher grocery store in New Jersey earlier this month that left six dead, including a police officer and three people inside the store.\n\nBeverly Hills police arrested Anton Nathaniel Redding of Millersville, Pa., earlier this month in connection with the ransacking of the city\u2019s Nessah Synagogue in which prayer books were shredded and several Jewish relics damaged.\n\nRedding has been charged with vandalism of a religious property and commercial burglary, charges that include a penalty enhancement for a hate crime, police said.\n\nHate crimes in Los Angeles County have reached their highest point in nearly a decade, according to an annual report by the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations. Although religious crimes overall declined slightly, anti-Jewish crimes rose 14% and constituted 83% of religion-motivated crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April, a shooting at the Chabad of Poway synagogue in San Diego County that left one dead came exactly six months after 11 worshipers were killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\nTimes staff writer Sarah Parvini contributed to this report.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Things to Do"], "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Brittny Mejia Is A Reporter On The Los Angeles Times", "Metro Desk Covering Breaking News", "Stories On Immigration", "Race.
