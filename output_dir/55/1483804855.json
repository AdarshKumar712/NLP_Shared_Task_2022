Same old Nick Kyrgios, it seems.\n\nThe Australian was in vintage form on Wednesday, saying he'd kept fit so far in 2020 while also enjoying a few \"frothies\" in the lead-up to the ATP Cup.\n\nFronting the media ahead of Australia's Group F battle in Brisbane against Germany, Greece and Canada, the 24 year-old seemingly had few concerns about injuries - or the huge suspended ban hanging over him this year.\n\n\"I have had no injuries of yet this year,\" quipped the world No.30, whose recurring collarbone problem forced him out of Australia's Davis Cup quarter-final rubber against Canada in November.\n\n\"I have had one session; the body held up well.\"\n\nHaving raised eyebrows when he was seen drinking until 11.30pm the night before he lost last year's second round Wimbledon clash to Rafael Nadal, Kyrgios could have been forgiven for keeping quiet his New Year's celebrations.\n\nBut he was quite happy to elaborate on that too.\n\n\"I had a couple of frothies last night, I am feeling good,\" he said.\n\nKyrgios's on-court behaviour will no doubt also come under scrutiny in Brisbane.\n\nHe will start 2020 with a 16-week suspended ban and fine that he copped from ATP officials last year.\n\nAsked if he was in a good space now, Kyrgios shrugged: \"I mean, it is New Year's today.\n\n\"I am feeling alright. I feel refreshed.\"\n\nThe former world No.13 finally got serious, saying the team environment of the ATP Cup would bring out his best.\n\n\"I love being around the boys. I love the team environment,\" he said.\n\n\"I do what I can to get the best out of these boys and I know I have their support - I just go out and bring good energy.\n\n\"And us Aussies we travel throughout the year. I was away for six and a half months (in 2019) so to be able to play in front of our home fans is awesome.\"\n\nKyrgios is joined by world No.18 Alex de Minaur in the Australian team for the inaugural 24-team event which starts on Friday.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Australia's Nick Kyrgios does not look like changing his ways in 2020 despite an injury cloud and a huge suspended fine hanging over him ahead of the ATP Cup.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://d3pbdxdl8c65wb.cloudfront.net/cloudinary/2018/Jun/28/rNoMOxYSdiyvYWxEBlPC.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "google-site-verification": "LLgWSPAesUa9X77EPVG9LjdUZuZ89ba7BxxBWumHKOo", "csrf-param": "_csrf", "csrf-token": "JtLH3v-TwqvF0AsPGXsRyzrl8nYuMs17LTawPkQZpkBpq7LziNvv2q3mb3dSMTySCJW9AmRghkJfW95xMlHIFw==", "title": "Kyrgios in vintage form ahead of ATP Cup - Seymour Telegraph", "twitter": {"title": "Kyrgios in vintage form ahead of ATP Cup - Seymour Telegraph", "description": "Australia's Nick Kyrgios does not look like changing his ways in 2020 despite an injury cloud and a huge suspended fine hanging over him ahead of the ATP Cup.", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "http://www.seymourtelegraph.com.au/tennis/2020/01/01/970071?slug=kyrgios-in-vintage-form-ahead-of-atp-cup", "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/cognitives/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy,h_675,q_auto,w_1200/zm8bj8btikpoxm1s291q"}, "og": {"title": "Kyrgios in vintage form ahead of ATP Cup - Seymour Telegraph", "url": "http://www.seymourtelegraph.com.au/tennis/2020/01/01/970071?slug=kyrgios-in-vintage-form-ahead-of-atp-cup", "type": "article", "site_name": "Seymour Telegraph", "image": {"identifier": "https://res.cloudinary.com/cognitives/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy,h_675,q_auto,w_1200/zm8bj8btikpoxm1s291q", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "description": "Australia's Nick Kyrgios does not look like changing his ways in 2020 despite an injury cloud and a huge suspended fine hanging over him ahead of the ATP Cup.", "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01 18:55:13", "modified_time": "2020-01-01 11:00:00"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "Free"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.seymourtelegraph.com.au/tennis/2020/01/01/970071?slug=kyrgios-in-vintage-form-ahead-of-atp-cup"}
