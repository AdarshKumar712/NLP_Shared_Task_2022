But even after reaching out only one faction was ready for discussion. Instances of burial being obstructed were reported. Since it was becoming a social issue, the government intervened, \u201d he said.\n\nThe dispute between Jacobite and the Orthodox faction over properties is continuing for long in Kerala and even after a Supreme Court verdict in 2017, the feud is yet to die down.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Kerala church feud"], "authors": ["Posted Qayam"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 03:06:59 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Thiruvananthapuram: In a bid to end the Church feud over burial grounds, the Kerala government on Wednesday proposed an ordinance making burial a right of", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/themes/sahifa/images/logos/siasat-app-icon-144.png", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "WBCm_7wL36LRSXmTyVOznSVTdM5XX0Id9zj9nH6SeEs", "fb": {"app_id": 347054199344775, "pages": 127989700566127}, "msvalidate.01": "40E981DE47FB62D9ABE31E163D2E51EC", "description": "Thiruvananthapuram: In a bid to end the Church feud over burial grounds, the Kerala government on Wednesday proposed an ordinance making burial a right of", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Govt brings in ordinance to resolve burial standoff", "description": "Thiruvananthapuram: In a bid to end the Church feud over burial grounds, the Kerala government on Wednesday proposed an ordinance making burial a right of", "url": "https://www.siasat.com/govt-brings-ordinance-resolve-burial-standoff-1779755/", "site_name": "The Siasat Daily", "updated_time": "2020-01-02T03:07:03+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Pinarayi_Vijayan.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Pinarayi_Vijayan.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 900}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/siasatdaily", "tag": "Kerala church feud", "section": "India", "published_time": "2020-01-02T03:06:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T03:07:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Thiruvananthapuram: In a bid to end the Church feud over burial grounds, the Kerala government on Wednesday proposed an ordinance making burial a right of", "title": "Govt brings in ordinance to resolve burial standoff", "site": "@TheSiasatDaily", "image": "https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Pinarayi_Vijayan.jpg", "creator": "@TheSiasatDaily"}, "geo.placename": "Hyderabad", "geo.position": "17.3863312;78.4736654", "geo.region": "IN", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.siasat.com/govt-brings-ordinance-resolve-burial-standoff-1779755/"}
