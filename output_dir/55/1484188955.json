It is about the territorial jurisdiction of Alaska tribes in general,\u201d she said, asking the district court to allow the state to intervene in the lawsuit on the side of the federal government.\n\nCourt documents indicate neither the plaintiff nor defendant have formally responded to the request.\n\nOfficials from the Alaska Department of Law were unable to comment on the intervention Tuesday, ahead of the New Year\u2019s holiday.\n\nEklutna is a Dena\u2019ina community within the Municipality of Anchorage, and the Native Village of Eklutna is a federally recognized tribal government.\n\nEklutna\u2019s lawsuit, filed in August, does not make statewide claims. Instead, it seeks to overturn a 2018 ruling by the Department of the Interior that a particular parcel of land near the Birchwood Airport in Chugiak is not \u201cIndian lands\u201d and is thus ineligible to host a tribal gaming hall.\n\nColin Cloud Hampson, an attorney representing the Native Village of Eklutna, said Tuesday afternoon that he had not yet had a chance to review the state\u2019s filing.\n\nThe facility would not host blackjack, slot machines and similar Vegas-style games, which are not authorized under state law. Instead, activity would be limited to games like pull-tabs, bingo and lotteries \u2014 and possibly electronic versions of those games.\n\nIn court filings, Harrison writes that the 2018 ruling by the Department of the Interior \u201cis about the territorial jurisdiction of Alaska tribes in general. ... So this case is also about territorial jurisdiction and governmental authority over Alaska Native allotments, generally.\"\n\nUnlike in the Lower 48, which has many Indian reservations, most Native lands in Alaska are owned by Native corporations representing Native shareholders, following passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971.\n\nAlaska\u2019s tribal governments are sovereign but have little or no land on which to exercise their laws. \u201cIndian Country,\u201d as it is formally known, is limited to Metlakatla \u2014 the state\u2019s only Indian reservation \u2014 and more than 16,000 small family allotments held in trust by the federal government.\n\nEklutna claims territorial jurisdiction over one such allotment north of Anchorage, and it says that jurisdiction gives it legal grounds to build a gaming hall. When the federal government denied that Eklutna has jurisdiction, the lawsuit followed.\n\nThe state of Alaska has historically opposed attempts by tribal governments to exercise jurisdiction, citing fears that the state could devolve into a patchwork of conflicting laws.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Earthquake"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The state is opposing a federal lawsuit brought by the Native Village of Eklutna as it attempts to build a tribal gaming hall.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/pb/resources/assets/img/adn/favicon.ico?v=adn", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "keywords": "jurisdiction, eklutna, alaska, state, government, lawsuit, gaming, village, opposition, Eklutna, land, ruling, anchorage, opinion, Alaska, department, games, bingo, game, attorney, case, interior, filing, law, class", "news_keywords": "jurisdiction, eklutna, alaska, state, government, lawsuit, gaming, village, opposition, Eklutna, land, ruling, anchorage, opinion, Alaska, department, games, bingo, game, attorney, case, interior, filing, law, class", "og": {"title": "Alaska moves to block Eklutna tribal gaming, saying success could allow similar projects statewide", "url": "https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2020/01/01/alaska-moves-to-block-eklutna-tribal-gaming-saying-success-could-allow-similar-projects-statewide/", "description": "The state is opposing a federal lawsuit brought by the Native Village of Eklutna as it attempts to build a tribal gaming hall.", "image": "https://www.adn.com/resizer/PKE3eDs-gnaDz5eau9mLrP29KVo=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-adn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PHL4S65OSZEODNQWJVFDHB6JN4.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anchorage Daily News", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Alaska News, Anchorage", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/akdispatch/", "published_time": "2020-01-01T02:57:22.940Z", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T03:11:22.803Z"}, "description": "The state is opposing a federal lawsuit brought by the Native Village of Eklutna as it attempts to build a tribal gaming hall.", "distribution": "global", "language": "en_US", "rating": "general", "twitter": {"title": "Alaska moves to block Eklutna tribal gaming, saying success could allow similar projects statewide", "description": "The state is opposing a federal lawsuit brought by the Native Village of Eklutna as it attempts to build a tribal gaming hall.", "image": "https://www.adn.com/resizer/PKE3eDs-gnaDz5eau9mLrP29KVo=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-adn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PHL4S65OSZEODNQWJVFDHB6JN4.jpg", "site": "${siteTwitterUser}", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@adndotcom"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1630656043895629}, "p": {"domain_verify": "bb45485406c9d670397d6aa46b9c295a"}, "google-site-verification": "e4e_-WAmmoxPeLD4wIMdaAzdGD-tOOK9L1UXROXN0-I", "msvalidate.01": "53E6F4F35803C44103778A38FBB16D3A", "robots": "index, follow, NOODP", "__sync_tenantId": "po_adn", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2020/01/01/alaska-moves-to-block-eklutna-tribal-gaming-saying-success-could-allow-similar-projects-statewide/"}
