The impact for us was on the Styrofoam.\n\n\u201cWe use the breakfast Styrofoam clamshell for the pancakes platter, and we had to switch to a platter that is now biodegradable that can handle the pancakes and the sauce etc... The actual cost increase on that platter alone was 68 cents to go to a biodegradable one.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf you think about any vendors that are using the regular Styrofoam lunch clamshell, they went to the paper thing and it doesn\u2019t quite work for putting scrambled eggs and pancakes on one platter.\n\n\u201cSo what we had to do is go to a high-grade biodegradable plastic thing that gives us a better-looking image. We didn\u2019t even have that option of going paper. Then we had the straws and coffee cups with the lids. We don\u2019t have any bags that were plastic; we already used paper.\u201d\n\nMr Cash said the increased costs involved in complying with the ban had created some challenges, explaining: \u201cI\u2019m absorbing that cost, which is insane. How do I pass this on? How do I pass this on to the consumer?\n\n\u201cAll of this cost increase is surrounding breakfast heavily because you have the breakfast platter now, the coffee cup and also the coffee stirrer. So it\u2019s a lot of cost for breakfast items we had to absorb.\n\n\u201cThe actual cost per month on this packaging is $1,000 per store, so I am looking at a $6,000 increase per month for this. So it is heavy. Let\u2019s not forget we have the knife, fork and spoon that are also going, along with this same breakfast platter, which is now biodegradable also. But we have already started to transition,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cAll of our inventory is in, and we have started to phase out, for example, a couple of sizes of the coffee cups and we have already moved to new ones. We have already transitioned to the breakfast platters, so as the old inventory phases out we already have the new inventory already sitting there waiting to transition over to.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how the other folks are absorbing these costs. Did the Government really think this through?,\u201d Mr Cash asked. \u201cI mean this is truly a real cost for this breakfast platter; this is the coffee cup, the platter, the knife and the fork. That is real cost.\n\n\u201cFor any vendor on the side of the road or anywhere, that new paper clamshell they are using, that is a new cost on a biodegradable knife and fork in the morning. So for them that is at least a 25 cent cost increase. I don\u2019t know what that clamshell is going to cost, but that knife and fork is going to get up there.\u201d\n\nHowever, Rupert Roberts, Super Value\u2019s principal, told Tribune Business: \u201cWe are ready and prepared, and we think it\u2019s going to go well.\u201d\n\nResponding to concerns that the switch from single-use plastic bags to more environmentally-friendly ones will drive up grocery costs, Mr Roberts said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. If a customer spends $200 and it gets in one bag, it will be 25 cents, and if it gets in two bags it will be 50 cents.\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a biggie. I really think in six months, when the plastics are out of the way, we\u2019ll be using compostable and we should go back to free bags, unless government wants to do something on that.\n\n\u201cWe do have compostable bags coming in in May; that\u2019s the earliest we can get them, but we do have six months to get rid of plastics and we should be able to go back to free. But it\u2019s hardly a percentage on the grocery shopping. We won\u2019t be able to get compostable bags until May or June, so our customers will be spending 25 cents per bag up until May or June. When we were aware of what we had to do we ordered, and that\u2019s when we expect them to come in,\u201d added Mr Roberts.\n\n\u201cWe are very late and should have acted earlier, and then checking yesterday, only 89 states in the US are banning so far. I checked with Canada yesterday, and they are charging for a plastic bag but they say that for five years people have been bringing down tote-bags to pack groceries.\u201d\n\nMr Roberts said the cost of switching from plastic bags to environmentally-friendly options was about \u201ca third or 50 percent more. I believe in my mind it\u2019s about from $50 to $70 per 2,000.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI thought five years ago that scientists said they would accept biodegradable. I thought five years ago biodegradable would be accepted and we switched to biodegradable and, of course, you take them in your workshop or you put something in them and you hang them up, and in six months they are in half-inch pieces. But now the compostables would disintegrate into powder.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that our generation has been used to, and fortunately the youth are being taught, and I think they think a lot different from us; they would never discard a plastic bag or throw a piece of plastic into the ocean. I think the crowd coming up behind us, if we don\u2019t save the world they will, and that is very encouraging.\n\n\u201cThey are more thoughtful than us and are going to do better than us. That helps the situation. It just seems that everybody is on board, and you hear a lot of fun and jokes and a lot of negativity, but the people with the fun and jokes and negativity, they are on board and they know we have to go in this direction/\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Major supermarket and fast-food restaurant\u00a0chains\u00a0yesterday pledged\u00a0they are \u201c100 percent ready\u201d for\u00a0single-use plastics ban that\u00a0takes effect tomorrow\u00a0despite the extra costs they will incur.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"description": "Major supermarket and fast-food restaurant\u00a0chains\u00a0yesterday pledged\u00a0they are \u201c100 percent ready\u201d for\u00a0single-use plastics ban that\u00a0takes effect tomorrow\u00a0despite the extra costs they will incur.", "og": {"title": "Private sector is \u2018100% ready\u2019 on plastics ban", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.tribune242.com/news/2019/dec/31/private-sector-100-ready-plastics-ban/"}, "viewport": "width=1020"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.tribune242.com/news/2019/dec/31/private-sector-100-ready-plastics-ban/"}
