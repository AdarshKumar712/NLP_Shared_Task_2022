deadly bushfire in the Australian state of Victoria.\n\nHuge bushfires have been burning for weeks across the country, with new blazes sparked into life almost daily by extremely hot and windy conditions in bushland left tinder dry after a three-year drought. Military moves in to help mass evacuation Fuelled by searing temperatures and high winds, more than 200 fires were now burning across the southeastern states of New South Wales and Victoria, threatening several towns.\n\nVictoria's Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters on Thursday that none of the 17 people missing in the East Gippsland region were emergency services personnel.\n\nThe increased number comes after family members confirmed Buchan man Mick Roberts had died at his home.\n\n\"There are at least 17 people that at this stage we cannot account for. Their whereabouts are unknown to us, plus there is one person confirmed as deceased,\" Mr Andrews told reporters at Bairnsdale.\n\n\"Whilst Victoria Police have not been through the official identification processes, it is clear that the Roberts family have identified Mr Roberts and we send our condolences to their family and the Buchan community to whom he was so well-known and very highly regarded.\"\n\nMr Andrews did not narrow down what communities of East Gippsland the missing people are from.\n\n\"It may be some of those people are safe but we hold very significant fears for the welfare of anybody who is missing at this time,\" he said.\n\nThe military has arrived to get fire victims across the region relief and resources, and also off the beach at Mallacoota.\n\nAbout 24 communities are isolated and reaching them to deliver supplies have been difficult.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said the federal government was offering any assistance requested.\n\n\"Our task has been to fully support and provide whatever assistance is necessary through all the various agencies of the Commonwealth,\" he told reporters in Sydney.\n\n\"The provision of disaster payments that have now exceeded some more than $21 million in New South Wales alone and we expect more of that to continue in Victoria as the full devastation of the fires there becomes more evident.\"\n\nAll fires in Victoria are currently sitting no higher than a watch and act alert, but smoky conditions have meant flights to rescue people, deliver supplies and swap out firefighters have at times been stopped.\n\nFirefighters are being helped on Thursday by moderate conditions, with temperatures in East Gippsland in the low to mid 20s expected to be paired with fairly light winds of up to 20 km/h.\n\nBut the mercury is forecast to creep up in the region on Friday, before reaching the 40s on Saturday, when the heat, hot winds and possible thunderstorms will increase the risk of new fires.\n\nPeople near the Corryong fire in Victoria's northeast near the NSW border are being doorknocked and told to get out of the region before the weekend.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 16:45:35 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/sites/all/themes/starcant/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Otago Daily Times Online News", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.odt.co.nz/star-news/star-international/serious-fears-17-missing-victoria", "title": "Serious fears for 17 missing in Victoria", "description": "There are serious fears for 17 people missing in a massive and deadly bushfires in the Australian state of Victoria.", "updated_time": "2020-01-02T16:45:35+13:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.odt.co.nz/sites/default/files/styles/odt_story_opengraph_1200w/public/story/2020/01/gipps_flames.png?itok=u4yqUrCz", "width": 1200, "height": 617}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@odtnews", "url": "https://www.odt.co.nz/star-news/star-international/serious-fears-17-missing-victoria", "title": "Serious fears for 17 missing in Victoria", "description": "There are serious fears for 17 people missing in a massive and deadly bushfires in the Australian state of Victoria.", "image": "https://www.odt.co.nz/sites/default/files/story/2020/01/gipps_flames.png"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-02T16:45:35+13:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T16:45:35+13:00"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#00aba9", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Star News", "application-name": "Star News", "msapplication-config": "/sites/all/themes/starcant/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.odt.co.nz/star-news/star-international/serious-fears-17-missing-victoria"}
