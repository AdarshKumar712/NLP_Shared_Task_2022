Vannatta of Maumelle, Arkansas, who was piloting the 2000 Mooney M20S, and his passenger, Darcy L. Matthews of Belton, Texas, died in the fiery crash shortly after 4 p.m., according to the highway patrol\u2019s preliminary crash report.\n\nVannatta is listed as a co-owner of the plane, according to the FAA aircraft registry.\n\nThe plane had just taken off from the airport at 151st Street and Pflumm Road on Runway 18, heading south. It began to slow and then turned over headed to the ground, according to a statement from the Kansas Highway Patrol.\n\nHoliday Sale! Get an annual digital subscription for only $20.

They were the only ones on board.\n\nOverland Park and Olathe police and fire personnel responded to the crash. The four- to six-passenger craft was on fire when they arrived.\n\n.\n\n\u201cWhen you see the scene, it\u2019s very tragic looking,\u201d Capt. Mike Hall, a spokesman for the Olathe Fire Department said Tuesday evening. \u201cMore than likely, they were thinking recovery at the first glance.\u201d\n\nFirefighters extinguished the fire withing 15 to 20 minutes, Hall said.\n\nIt was unknown what caused the crash or where the plane was headed, Kansas Highway Patrol trooper Gustavo Ramirez said Tuesday evening. The pilot had not submitted a flight plan, which is not required for all flights.\n\nAn investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is expected to arrive Wednesday and will take over the investigation into the crash.\n\nThe investigator will document the crash, taking photos and measurements as well as talking to witnesses and gathering air traffic control recordings. The wreckage will then be moved a secured location to be examined further, said Eric Weiss, a spokesman for the NTSB.\n\nA preliminary report is expected to be available in about two weeks, with the final report completed in 18 to 24 months.\n\nThe Executive Airport has reopened, Johnson County announced on Twitter shortly before noon Wednesday.\n\nThe Johnson County Executive Airport has re-opened.
