Their whereabouts are unknown to us, plus there is one person confirmed as deceased,\" Andrews told reporters at Bairnsdale.\n\n\"Whilst Victoria Police have not been through the official identification processes, it is clear that the Roberts family have identified Mr Roberts and we send our condolences to their family and the Buchan community to whom he was so well-known and very highly regarded.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Naval ship arrives at Mallacoota to evacuate people as bushfires cut off town\n\n* Lives lost, homes destroyed as deadly bushfires rage in Australia\n\n* Naval ships, aircraft ready for Australia bushfire rescues as thousands jump in water to flee flames\n\n* 'Out of control': Volunteer firefighters in Australia demand income support, equipment\n\nAndrews did not narrow down what communities of East Gippsland the missing people are from.\n\n\"It may be some of those people are safe but we hold very significant fears for the welfare of anybody who is missing at this time,\" he said.\n\nAP In this image made from video, an aerial scene shows fires burning and smoke rising close to properties in Bundoora, Victoria, on Monday.
