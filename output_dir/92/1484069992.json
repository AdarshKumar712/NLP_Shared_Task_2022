Temps will rise a touch late.\n\nThursday looks nice and notably milder with ample sun and highs approaching 50.\n\nWidespread light rain will develop after midnight Thursday night and continue through Friday with highs on Friday well into the 40s.\n\nRain will continue on and off into Saturday morning, but colder air arriving from the northwest will begin to transition rain over to snow from west to east mainly after noon but this will happen earlier to our west. The timing is a close call.\n\nColder air will settle in for Sunday and stick around through Wednesday with occasional light snow showers through this period. Thursday then looks quiet with perhaps another warm up to follow for Friday with more rain showers.\n\nHappy New Year!", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Todd Kerkman", "Rochester", "News", "Weather", "Weather Stories"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Published Pm Et Jan."], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Rainy weather returns Friday and Saturday.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": null, "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rainy weather returns Friday and Saturday.", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "HTML5,Flash", "PreferredFormats": "MPEG4"}, "robots": "noodp, noydir", "googlebot": "index, follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=740948885", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.twcable.twcnews", "keywords": "Todd Kerkman, Rochester, News, Weather, Weather Stories", "news_keywords": "Todd Kerkman, Rochester, News, Weather, Weather Stories", "og": {"title": "Very Nice Thursday", "type": "article", "url": "https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/rochester/weather/2020/01/01/rochester-area-weather-forecast", "description": "Thursday looks great!", "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/r_partly-cloudy_skypng-99"}, "twitter": {"title": "Very Nice Thursday", "description": "Thursday looks great!", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/rochester/weather/2020/01/01/rochester-area-weather-forecast", "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/r_partly-cloudy_skypng-99"}, "story": {"headline": "Very Nice Thursday", "description": "Rainy weather returns Friday and Saturday."}}, "canonical_link": "https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/rochester/weather/2020/01/01/rochester-area-weather-forecast"}
