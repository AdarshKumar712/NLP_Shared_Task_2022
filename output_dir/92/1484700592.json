In a since-deleted Instagram post, Hopkins shared a picture making a catch against White that said, \u201c2020 mood.\u201d\n\nNuk is clearly looking forward to his Wild Card matchup with Tre'Davious White \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/1iScw4q79N \u2014 NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) January 1, 2020\n\nIn last year\u2019s matchup against the Bills, Hopkins caught five passes for 63 yards and one touchdown. That said, only two of the receptions came against White. Buffalo\u2019s No. 1 cornerback was in coverage on Hopkins\u2019 touchdown reception, but his coverage could not have been much better.\n\nThis go around will be interesting as White went the entire regular season without allowing a touchdown in coverage. Despite his impressive play, Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson plans to throw to Hopkins early and often on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still going at him. I\u2019m gonna compete and I\u2019m gonna go at him and just play ball,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIf my guy\u2019s open or if the coverage take me that way I\u2019m gonna throw it that way. You gotta give him respect and definitely pick your spots. But at the same time you can\u2019t let that (make you) shy away from doing what you want to do.\u201d\n\nBuy Buffalo Bills tickets: StubHub, SeatGeek, Ticketmaster\n\nREAD MORE\n\nTexans\u2019 Deshaun Watson planning to go at Bills\u2019 Tre White, likes match up with DeAndre Hopkins\n\nNFL Playoffs: 6 things to know about the Houston Texans, Buffalo Bills\u2019 Wild Card Weekend opponent\n\nBreaking down what key injuries for Bills & Texans mean to Wild Card Playoff match up\n\nBuffalo Bills rebuilt offensive line flourishing under Bobby Johnson\u2019s player-friendly style", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ryan Talbot", "Rtalbot Nyup.Com"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 01:28:32 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/pf/resources/images/newyorkupstate/favicon.ico?d=731", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435, "app_id": 430062370493851}, "title": "DeAndre Hopkins gives Tre\u2019Davious White, Buffalo Bills bulletin board material ahead of Wild Card Weekend", "og": {"title": "DeAndre Hopkins gives Tre\u2019Davious White, Bills bulletin board material", "url": "https://www.newyorkupstate.com/buffalo-bills/2020/01/deandre-hopkins-gives-tredavious-white-buffalo-bills-bulletin-board-material-ahead-of-wild-card-weekend.html", "site_name": "newyorkupstate", "type": "article", "description": "Hopkins has since deleted his Instagram post.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.newyorkupstate.com/resizer/IpV3ghA2HV-vfrhwRJ5BNqIpqWA=/1280x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KEDXAMUS6VAAVIYWZ7IBJ4GZFA.jpg", "width": 1280}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-02T01:28:32.235Z", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T15:28:25.711Z", "section": "Buffalo Bills", "tag": "Bills 2019,Buffalo Bills,Houston Texans,DeAndre Hopkins,Tre'Davious White"}, "twitter": {"title": "DeAndre Hopkins gives Tre\u2019Davious White, Bills bulletin board material", "site": "@newyorkupstate", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Hopkins has since deleted his Instagram post.", "image": "https://www.newyorkupstate.com/resizer/IpV3ghA2HV-vfrhwRJ5BNqIpqWA=/1280x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KEDXAMUS6VAAVIYWZ7IBJ4GZFA.jpg"}, "article_publication_name": "https://www.newyorkupstate.com/buffalo-bills/2020/01/deandre-hopkins-gives-tredavious-white-buffalo-bills-bulletin-board-material-ahead-of-wild-card-weekend.html", "article_date_original": "Wednesday, January 01, 2020, 08:28 PM", "article_date_updated": "Thursday, January 02, 2020, 10:28 AM", "sailthru.tags": "buffalo bills,football,bills 2019,houston texans,bobby johnson,white,deandre hopkins,hopkins", "sailthru.date": "Wednesday, January 01, 2020, 08:28 PM", "sailthru.title": "DeAndre Hopkins gives Tre\u2019Davious White, Buffalo Bills bulletin board material ahead of Wild Card Weekend", "sailthru.author": "rtalbot", "sailthru.description": "Hopkins has since deleted his Instagram post.", "sections": "buffalo-bills,sports", "byline": "Ryan Talbot | rtalbot@nyup.com", "subscriber_only": "false", "Description": "Hopkins has since deleted his Instagram post.", "article_author": "Ryan Talbot | rtalbot@nyup.com"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.syracuse.com/buffalo-bills/2020/01/deandre-hopkins-gives-tredavious-white-buffalo-bills-bulletin-board-material-ahead-of-wild-card-weekend.html"}
