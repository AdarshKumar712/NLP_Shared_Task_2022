From Jan. 8 -28, 2020, Christ Memorial Church will be one of 60 remote webcast locations worldwide to broadcast one of the nation\u2019s leading lecture and cultural arts series.\n\nThe 2020 series features New York Times best-selling authors, Billboard-topping musicians, and a 41-year veteran of the White House press corps.\n\nThe January Series lectures will be video streamed live at Christ Memorial Church, 5995 Graafschap Road, Holland, from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. The lectures are free and open to the public.\n\nA few of the notable names in the 2020 lineup include: Ann Compton, who covered seven presidents; Mitch Albom, an author, columnist, radio host, and philanthropist whose books have sold more than 39 million copies and been translated into more than 45 languages; and Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at NYU whose last two books were New York Times best-sellers.\n\nThe 15 speakers will provide insight on issues like poverty and hunger, the global water crisis, immigration, mass incarceration, religious freedom, and big data\u2019s inequality and threat to democracy.\n\nKristi Potter, the director of the January Series says the goal of the series is to cultivate deep thought and conversations about important issues of the day so as to inspire cultural renewal and the shaping of better global citizens in God\u2019s world.\n\n\u201cGaining knowledge is the first step to making a difference,\u201d said Potter. \u201cIf we don\u2019t know about these topics, then we don\u2019t know how we can actually make a difference.\u201d\n\nPotter says this work starts with listening, even to those with whom we may disagree. She says day two of the January Series will provide a great opportunity for attendees to see what this looks like.\n\n\u201cWe have the opportunity to hear from two respected scientists who hold opposing viewpoints on the topic of origins. One is a six-day creationist, the other a theistic evolutionist, and both feel strongly about their views. Both actually feel the other person\u2019s view is harming the church,\u201d said Potter. \u201cAnd yet, the two have learned to talk to rather than past one another, using respectful dialogue with the understanding that they are both Christians. This moderated conversation will serve as a model for us for how to have difficult conversations \u2014 something we aspire to foster through this series and in all of our work at Calvin University.\u201d\n\nWhile Potter says the series will dig deep into some of the complex issues facing the world today, it will also highlight the great progress being made in some of these areas. She expects it will inspire hope.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom, positive things are happening. I hope those who tune into the series this coming year will leave hopeful for the future and understand how they can take steps to make a difference. And maybe that step is just being more willing to listen to one another and acknowledging one another for who they are.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, 60 remote locations will carry the January Series \u2014 spanning 22 U.S. states, three Canadian provinces, and one site in Europe.\n\nAbout the January Series\n\nStarted in 1988, the January Series is an annual, award-winning, 15-day lecture series that exists to cultivate deep thought and conversations about important issues of the day in order to inspire cultural renewal and better equip global citizens in God\u2019s world. The series is free and open to the public.
