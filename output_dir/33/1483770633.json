a list of the decade's movies is an impossible task, but here are our curated favourites of the 2010s.\n\nFormer US president Barack Obama has released a list of his favourite movies and TV shows of 2019 \u2013 and one inclusion on the list is raising eyebrows.\n\nObama named well-received movies like the Aretha Franklin doco Amazing Grace, teen comedy Booksmart and Bong Joon-ho\u2019s brilliant Parasite among his favourite flicks of the year and included a handful of sterling TV shows that he \u201cconsidered as powerful as movies\u201d:\n\nNext up are my favorite movies and TV shows of 2019. Of course, there\u2019s also American Factory, a film from our own production company, Higher Ground, that was recently shortlisted for an Oscar. Here\u2019s the full list: pic.twitter.com/PEcgwotcxm \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) December 29, 2019\n\nAmong them, series 2 of writer-performer Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s award-winning comedy Fleabag about the misadventures of a young single woman in London.\n\nFleabag broke through to a wider audience with its brilliant second season this year, but fans who\u2019ve watched the first season, released in 2016, will no doubt remember a certain scene from the very first episode.\n\nIn the scene, Fleabag\u2019s furious boyfriend breaks up with her after he discovers her in bed masturbating \u2026 while watching a Barack Obama speech on YouTube. Here\u2019s the scene in question (it\u2019s a little NSFW):\n\nThat time Fleabag got caught masturbating to Obama... pic.twitter.com/JeQSJgrQWr \u2014 BBC iPlayer (@BBCiPlayer) January 1, 2019\n\nNow, Obama was careful to note that it was Fleabag: Season 2 that had made his list \u2013 but the show\u2019s very inclusion has many asking if the former president has seen the scene in question:\n\nok i'm gonna try to be calm about this but doesn't the Fleabag pilot have a scene where she MASTURBATES TO AN OBAMA SPEECH pic.twitter.com/py7I5FVI6T \u2014 Tony Tulathimutte (@tonytula) December 29, 2019\n\ni am crying that obama watches fleabag and has now watched a posh british woman wank over him https://t.co/OT3MDoP9zH \u2014 kav \ud83d\uddd1 (@Kav_Kaushik) December 29, 2019\n\nSo does this mean that Obama watched the first season of Fleabag, in which Fleabag masturbates to Obama? pic.twitter.com/qoAz2MA7SO \u2014 \ud835\udd17\ud835\udd25\ud835\udd22 \u2111\ud835\udd2a\ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd2c\ud835\udd30\ud835\udd31\ud835\udd2f\ud835\udd22\ud835\udd30\ud835\udd30 \u211c\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd1f\ud835\udd1f\ud835\udd26\ud835\udd31\ud835\udd31 (@haveycavey) December 29, 2019\n\nObama watches Fleabag.\n\n\n\nPresuming he's also seen Series 1 this means he's watched a woman wanking off to one of his speeches.\n\n\n\nIt's things like this why I have Twitter. https://t.co/yqjcYOEGLB \u2014 Rachel Griffiths (@sunflowersutra1) December 29, 2019\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge realizing President Obama watched her masturbate to him in @FLEABAG \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f pic.twitter.com/gwcXDYDLP6 \u2014 LadyLover (@MultiGayShipper) December 29, 2019\n\nThe fact that Fleabag masturbated to Obama's speech and it's on his list of favorite series makes me miss him and his coolness that much more. https://t.co/vN3dBsG87c \u2014 Angela Belcamino (@AngelaBelcamino) December 29, 2019\n\nWhat am I up to?
