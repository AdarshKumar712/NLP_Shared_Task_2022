As you enjoy this sultry beauty, take a moment to raise a glass to him.\n\nThe wine is light on its feet, with a silken texture, generous flavors of blackberry and Queen Anne cherry, and a brightness not unlike cool water splashing on river rocks. This wine does Burt Williams proud.\n\nWith an ultra-premium wine, it is easy to feel obligated to go fancy when pairing it at the table. And, of course, you can. Rare rack of lamb with potato puree, grilled Liberty duck breast with farro, braised mushrooms with polenta, and a luscious crab bisque all help this wine soar into its most gorgeous self.\n\nBut you needn\u2019t go this route. The wine is just lovely with simpler, more humble fair. Enjoy it with roasted carrots and parsnips drizzled with the season\u2019s newest olive oil, olio nuovo. Serve it alongside a great steak sandwich, with cioppino, or with a bowl of creamy polenta topped with olive oil and Gorgonzola cheese.\n\nFor today\u2019s recipe, I\u2019m reviving an old Christmas Eve favorite, a simple dish of broad noodles accented with more nutmeg that you might think would be good. But it resonates in such a gorgeous way with the threads of spice in the wine that both the pasta and the wine itself soar. Serve the dish as a first course, as a side dish, or as a bed for, say, seared duck breast.\n\nLasagna Noodles with Nutmeg & Cheese\n\nMakes 3 to 4 servings as a first course\n\n12-16 broad, flat noodles, see note below\n\n\u2014 Kosher salt\n\n4 tablespoons butter\n\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, preferably olio nuovo, or\n\n2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper\n\n1\u00bd teaspoons freshly grated nutmeg\n\n3 ounces (\u00be cup) grated Vella Dry Jack, Estero Gold, Parmigiano-Reggiano or similar cheese\n\n\u00bc cup chopped walnuts, preferably red, lightly toasted\n\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley\n\nFill a large pot half full with water, add a generous tablespoon of salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the noodles and cook until just done, 2 to 3 minutes for fresh, 8 to 12 for dried.\n\nPut the butter and oil into a wide sauce pan and set it over very low heat until it just melts. Add the pepper, nutmeg and a generous teaspoon of salt and remove from the heat. Warm four soup plates or pasta bowls.\n\nDrain the pasta and quickly tip it into the saucepan with the butter. Turn the pasta gently a few times to coat it thoroughly and divide it between the plates or bowls. Top each portion with cheese, walnuts and parsley and enjoy right away.\n\nNote: For best results, use broad thin lasagna noodles, preferably Italian, that do not have ruffled edges. Alternately, you can use pappardelle or tagliatelle, which is about twice as wide as fettuccine.\n\nMichele Anna Jordan is the author of 24 books to date.
