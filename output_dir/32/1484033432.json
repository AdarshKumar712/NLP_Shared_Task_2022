Claire Palmer/Star Photo\n\nThe Friedom hotel is one of the oldest buildings in Golden. Located at 511 Main Street, it was originally built in the early 20th century. The hotel first opened its doors just over 90 years ago, in 1928.\n\nNow, the building is getting a face lift, and as it nears its centennial birthday, it\u2019s being brought into the 21st century by the new owners. Once formerly owned and occupied by Cox and Company, husband and wife Mike Taylor and Claire Dibble have become the new owners, taking over the building on April 15, 2019.\n\nAccording to Taylor, the renovations included adding a hallway to allow second floor tenants access to their offices without going through the main floor store fronts, several utility upgrades and making sure that everything was up to modern provincial codes and standards.\n\nA tree faller with Sawtooth Tree Services and involved in the ski industry, Taylor has had to briefly put his life on hold while he patches up the old hotel.\n\n\u201cI put everything aside for six months to do this, and I\u2019m just coming up on the end of six months now, and I\u2019m still doing work,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun. It\u2019s been challenging. It\u2019s a heavy work load, but it\u2019s very enjoyable.\u201d\n\nWorking on the building has given Taylor an opportunity to learn more about the history of the hotel. He\u2019s read archived articles about opening day in 1928, and says that people frequently approach him to share their knowledge of the building.\n\n\u201cPeople have been interested to chat about their experience with the building,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cA lot of people have been stopping in and telling me their stories and it\u2019s been really fascinating.\u201d\n\nThe idea to take over the building was born out of the idea of restoring the hotel to its former glory, but with a modern twist.\n\n\u201cIt was an opportunity that we learned of and we just saw a chance to bring a beautiful old building back to life,\u201d said Taylor.\n\nOriginally, the hotel had 14 rooms, four bathrooms and a communal dining area. Now, the building has four residential suites, one one-bedroom and three two-bedroom apartments, as well as retail and office space.\n\nWhile there is still one apartment available, all of the retail space has been spoken for, with businesses like the newly minted Worthy Boutique. When searching for businesses, Taylor says they were looking for a particular kind of business to embody what the Friedom hotel is all about.\n\n\u201cWe wanted them to be energetic, successful and not noisy,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cEverything is spoken for and rented, we found great businesses.\u201d\n\nTaylor anticipates that around 90 per cent of the planned renovations and construction will be done in the next couple of weeks. While the work has been enjoyable, Taylor is eager to get back to his regular daily life.\n\nFor now, Taylor and Dibble are going to continue with what they\u2019re doing and continue to upgrade the building.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["KIJHL", "Golden Rockets", "Celebrations of Life"], "authors": ["Claire Palmer"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 02:30:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Friedom hotel is one of the oldest buildings in Golden.
