            With developments going from bad to worse for the Iranian regime, the mullahs have decided to play a 40 year-old card. They have orchestrated an attack on a U.S. embassy, this time the one in Baghdad.

President Trump summarized the situation in this tweet:

   <i> Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified. </i>

Trump’s expectation of protection from the Iraqi government

            <div class="reply-text">Why were these "protestors" allowed into the Embassy undeterred? $1000. to $1. not one magazine was emptied in it's defense. The Marines look real pretty in their red striped pants, but maybe some Boy Scouts from Texas could do a better job, at least they know how to shoot. The feckless Marines put on Embassy Duty evidently are deployed there to be decoration not a deterrence.  The US Army should have relieved the marines of Embassy Protection after their performance in 1979.</div>

            <div class="reply-text">And therein lies the rub.  Will the Iraqi government step up to protect our embassy?  Or should we just pull out and let them fend for themselves.  Their government has not been  the most reliable in the past.  Poster #2 is so filled with ignorance it breaks my heart.  It is not up to the boots on the ground to decide to fire.  It is up to the commanders at the Pentagon who decide.  And IIRC, Carter disarmed those Marines in 1979.   The most trouble embassies ever have is when a democrat is in the WH.  Clinton allowed for many bombings, Carter had the hostage crisis, and Obama had Benghazi.  Give the Marines a break and stop with the disrespect.</div>

            <div class="reply-text">When Obama pulled the troops out of Iraq, Iran came in in full force. Iraq has become a satellite of Iran. Iranian blocks control the Iraqi Parliament, and the caretaker Prime Minister of the Iraqi government is an Iranian puppet. Iran is stealing Iraqi wealth and using Iraq to bypass US sanctions, Yes, we need more troops there by the thousands.</div>

            <div class="reply-text">FTA: "...the number of troops will initially be less than a 1,000. A larger force of several thousand soldiers has also been placed on stand-by..."

Another "surge" to secure a $750 Million embassy that was supposed to be the most secure in the world.  Waiting for a useless "government" to protect it, even after nearly two decades of training and "liberty".  More American lives potentially on the line...to what end?

Any "orders" sent down by Jimmy Carter, who left office in 1981, are easily rescindable today, and have been ever since then.  Somehow these orders survived several CINCs, from Reagan to Trump. Seems an empty excuse for exactly what #2 wrote.  These Marines, following orders or otherwise, are clearly nothing more than decoration if unable to use their skills and weapons for the purported purpose they are stationed at our embassies.</div>

            <div class="reply-text">I think direct conflict with Iran is inevitable, as much as it is unwanted. It will not be a nuking of cities or bombing of the population, but will be targeted action against the leadership, military facilities and nuclear development locations. We will not go it alone either. Israel is at the tipping point too. The Russians and Chinese will make a lot of noise, but will end up influencing the remaining leadership to surrender. They need the oil.</div>

            <div class="reply-text">I’ve just gone back and re-read some articles about this posted here yesterday and found that this is not the first time that #2 has bashed the Marines.  I wonder what his issue is.  Was he tossed out because he couldn’t cut it at boot camp?

My husband walked in and volunteered to be a Marine in 1969, even though he had a high draft number and at a time when some of his friends were burning their draft cards and high-tailing it to Canada.  He served for 2 years and got orders for Nam, but they were rescinded because, by then, the Pentagon was beginning to pull the Marines out in accordance with the “first in, first out” rule.  I also served at 2 American embassies overseas, one behind the Iron Curtain, and have tremendous respect for ALL Marines.</div>

            <div class="reply-text">Most of the media reports on what is occurring at the US Embassy is misleading as the “protesters” have not taken over the Embassy grounds, what they have actually done is take over part of a wall and a couple of buildings on the compound perimeter setting fires and vandalizing US property there. The US Marine guard force has kept the “protesters” away from the main embassy buildings. Right now it will tell a lot as to the competence and motives of the Iraqi government and military by what happens next, as while the Iraqi military should never have allowed the “protesters” to even approach the embassy outer perimeter in the first place, and should now be moving the “protesters” from the embassy grounds.</div>

            <div class="reply-text">Attacking the Marines is unfair. They cannot act outside of the rules. Calling them a decoration is out of line. They are there under orders. This mocking of Marines when rules may not have allowed them to anything different is unfair. There is a valid issue raised by this situation. We should get our buns out of there but with that aside, this lands on the back of The Commander. If we are to be there then lets make it clear that if the embassy or people are attacked we will take immediate action and use whatever force our Marines deem is necessary. What is this stuff about trusting in anyone else to defend our people wherever they may be. 
With the advent of a new year we have seen the lists of promises President Trump has kept and it is fantastic. Reaching back into time to show what great things he has done. I would like for him to reach back in history and bring back the ... and carry a big stick.</div>

        Sacramento-

When Jerry Brown became governor yet again in 2011, I warned my conservative friends not to be too upset at the prospect. “It’s not going to get any better than this,” I’d say. Indeed, Brown’s final eight years in office were mostly smooth sailing, and the dwindling number of Capitol Republicans rarely criticized his administration too harshly.

There was plenty to moan about — the record-setting budgets, a major tax increase, the overheated climate-change rhetoric, the failure to rein in unfunded liabilities — but a lot to commend, as well. He got a red-ink-soaked budget on track, passed modest pension reform, dealt successfully with a court-driven prison-overcrowding crisis,

        Since the 2018 elections, we have seen a lot of stupid people electing Democrats in state and local elections, and since the garbage Democrats have the garbage Midas touch – everything they come in contact with turns to a Scat Francisco sidewalk – these dumb voters are now suffering the consequences of their misguided trust in these aspiring authoritarians. Democrats win when rich donors pump money into races behind candidates who pretend not to be the gimps of the hard-left cabal that actually runs the party. And the radicals who got elected pretending to be not-insane are getting into office and doing all the insane stuff

        It's human nature to focus on the negative, so it’s worth starting 2020 with an earnest appreciation of all the gains we made during the last decade. Despite the doom-and-gloom rhetoric of economic disaster pushed by politicians left and right, honest reflection reveals that the 2010s were arguably the single most magnificent decade of economic progress in human history.

The statistics showing growth over the last 10 years are almost mind-blowing.

Extreme poverty, defined as the number of people globally living on less than $1.90 a day, fell from a whopping 18.2% of the world in 2008 to just 8.6% in 2018. This means that over the last decade or so,

        The battle for the Democratic nomination is nearing crunch time with roughly one month left before the Iowa caucuses.

Some big-name candidates have dropped out — most notably Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) — while former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has joined the field.

Who has the best chance of winning the nomination?


<b>1. Former Vice President</b>Joe Biden (July ranking: 2) 

Biden has led national polls since he launched his campaign in April. 

His advantage has eroded since then, but it is still significant. The former vice president is roughly 10 points ahead of his nearest challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), in the polling averages

        With developments going from bad to worse for the Iranian regime, the mullahs have decided to play a 40 year-old card. They have orchestrated an attack on a U.S. embassy, this time the one in Baghdad.

President Trump summarized the situation in this tweet:

   <i> Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified. </i>

Trump’s expectation of protection from the Iraqi government

        Inequality won the electoral vote for Donald Trump in 2016.

Four writers in the Nation admitted as much the day after the election. “Inequality created the presidency of Donald Trump,” they wrote. But the president’s antagonists generally appear loath to admit this. They speak of inequality in relation to nations across the globe, the inequality of transgenders, inequality between races or the sexes, and climate change inequality necessitating wealthy nations to pay a tax to offset natural disasters in poorer nations ostensibly caused by the consumption and emissions of the First World.

        Former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn became the latest high-profile financial fugitive to make a cinematic escape from law-enforcement authorities this week.

Mercenaries posing as musicians reportedly helped Ghosn flee financial crimes charges in Japan by dragging him out of the country in a musical instrument case, his first step on the way to Lebanon. But previous business bigwigs have used similarly dramatic means to get out of dodge. One staged his death while others fled for foreign countries only to return and face the music later.

        Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker granted tens of thousands of pardons for people convicted of low-level marijuana-related offenses on Tuesday.

The Land of Lincoln is set to welcome a new marijuana legalization law on January 1, becoming the 11th state to legalize pot for those 21 years of age and older.

Pritzker, a Democrat whose family owns the Hyatt hotel chain, described the more than 11,000 expungements as the first step in anticipation of the new law taking effect on Wednesday.

He announced the pardons at a church on Chicago's South Side, claiming the action will help offenders find work, housing and college aid.

        A Texas sheriff’s deputy died in a hospital Tuesday after being shot multiple times during a traffic stop, authorities said.

Deputy Chris Dickerson, 28, a veteran of the U.S. Army and Texas Army National Guard, was with the Panola County Sheriff’s Office for eight years and was the married father of two young children, The Associated Press reported.

“This young man gave his life doing what he was put on this Earth to do,” Sheriff Kevin Lake told the Panola Watchman.

        The state of Montana could soon be represented by a second representative in the U.S. House after the 2020 census, according to figures released Monday.

Census information first reported by The Wall Street Journal found that the state's population grew by nearly 80,000 between 2010 and 2019, leading analysts to predict the state would be among several to gain representatives in Congress following the official results' release next year.

Other states projected by the Journal to gain congressional seats include North Carolina, Arizona, Oregon, Florida, and Colorado. States including California, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota were projected to lose one representative each.

        <p>I&rsquo;ve previously written about how the Democratic Party has embraced anti-Semitism and defended rabid anti-Semites in their party. But as anti-Semitism becomes increasingly mainstream in the Democratic Party, rather than addressing the problem, Democrats are deflecting, trying to paint anti-Semitism as a Trump problem. Rep. Eric Swalwell recently alleged in an op-ed in the Jewish magazine Forward that Donald Trump is &ldquo;embracing anti-Semitism.&rdquo; Because Trump, who has a daughter who&rsquo;s a converted Jew and Jewish grandchildren, is obviously an anti-Semite, or something.

        The truth behind House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff’s role in engineering President Trump’s impeachment may soon come out. Judicial Watch, a nonprofit group promoting government transparency, is suing to get the whistleblower’s e-mails.

That’s good news. Because no matter what comes of Trump’s Senate trial, Schiff should be held accountable for his devious methods.

The public also needs the truth about the so-called whistleblower. Real whistleblowers deserve to be treated like heroes.

        VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis apologized Wednesday for his widely-viewed slap of a woman who had grabbed his hand as he greeted Catholic faithful on New Year’s Eve.
The image of Francis slapping his way free from the clutches of the admirer was an instant hit on social media.  A personal apology followed. “We lose patience many times,” Francis confessed. “It happens to me too. I apologize for the bad example given yesterday,” the head of the Catholic church said before celebrating Mass at the Vatican.

        Ever since it was discovered that several armed churchgoers drew their weapons to stop a gunman at a church in Texas last week, the anti-gun mainstream media types have been trying to tell the public that armed, law-abiding citizens are a bad thing.

The New Year's Day installment of media malpractice hyperbole arrives courtesy of the nauseatingly leftist USA Today: "@USATODAY Opinion: Jack Wilson is exactly the type of person you want around with a gun because he's a firearms instructor. But we know nothing about the at least six other parishioners who also appeared to draw their handguns. And that's terrifying."

        The White House National Security Council staff is being downsized sharply in a bid to improve efficiency within the policy coordinating body by consolidating positions and cutting staff.

A second, unspoken thrust of the overhaul is a hoped-for end to what many critics see as a string of politically damaging, unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information. Leaks of President Trump’s conversations with foreign leaders and other damaging disclosures likely originated with anti-Trump officials in the White House who stayed over from the Obama administration, according to several current and former White House officials.

White House National Security Adviser Robert C. O’Brien is leading the NSC reform effort.

        For Republicans, the 2010s end with the party seemingly in a better situation than it was when the decade started. The GOP has control of the White House and the Senate. Ten years ago, the Democrats held the White House and both houses of Congress.

But that scorecard doesn't tell the whole story. Thanks to five major blunders over the last decade, the Republican Party is actually weaker than it was on Jan.1, 2010. To understand why, you have to document each key mistake in order:

        When Kimberly Dudik ran for her fourth term in the Montana House, state officials told her she could not use campaign money to pay for child care for her four young children.

She is now running for attorney general and is trying to visit a big chunk of the sprawling state, spending hours on the road. That means she needs even more help picking up her kids at school and day care when she's away and her husband has a late night at the office. (snip) Only six states have laws specifically allowing campaign money to be used for child care.

        Iran-backed militiamen behind an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, have begun retreating from the area on Wednesday following a threat from President Donald Trump to hold Tehran accountable for the siege. “Supporters of the Kataib Hezbollah militia who had spent the night camped outside the embassy began dismantling their tents and leaving the area, saying they had won a victory and would now seek the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq through the nation’s parliament,” the Washington Post reports. The development comes after Department of Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced

        Nancy Pelosi, AKA Nasty Nancy, allowed Adam Schiff, AKA Shifty Schiff, to run the impeachment "inquiry" through Shifty's Intelligence Committee, where Shifty had total control.  He set the rules to allow only the witnesses he wanted.  He lied in his opening statement to commence the inquiry by making up President Trump's phone conversation with Ukraine's President Zelensky.  The resulting vote to impeach was a foregone conclusion regardless of the evidence, or lack thereof.

Pelosi has not sent Shifty's articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial because she said she wants to first see the Senate trial procedures.

        Companies set up by members of a self-described and state-recognized Creek Indian tribe in Alabama have received more than $240 million in federal minority-business contracts, despite a determination by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs that there is no credible evidence the group has Native American ancestry, a Los Angeles Times investigation has found.

Federal contracts worth an additional $273 million have gone to two companies run by a member of a different Native American group in Alabama with no federal recognition as a tribe.

        Ghislaine Maxwell — the British socialite who’s long been accused of serving as Jeffrey Epstein’s madam — is hiding in a series of safe houses and is being “protected because of the information she has on the world’s most powerful people.”

Maxwell, 58, allegedly procured young women and groomed them to have sex with Epstein and his wealthy pals, but she has remained out of public view after the convicted sex offender’s re-arrest last year and his death in jail in August. She has always denied any wrongdoing. On the heels of a Reuters report that Maxwell was the main focus of an investigation by the FBI

        First Lady Melania Trump brought the fireworks as she entered the annual New Year’s Eve celebration at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday evening.
Melania Trump strutted into the New Year, alongside President Trump, in a sequins embroidered evening gown by Givenchy that resembled the sparks of fireworks in the sky. The gown is cut from black silk georgette, features a round neckline, and gradient-like gold sequin embroidery that trickles down from top to bottom. Currently, the Givenchy frock retails for about $4,740. Mrs. Trump chose a pair of black satin pointed stilettos by Manolo Blahnik and her signature smoldering smokey eye makeup for the night of celebration.

        PALM BEACH, Fla. — At the White House, people who want to meet with Donald Trump have to deal with schedulers, scores of aides hovering around the president and a strict security protocol.

At Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s luxury South Florida resort where he typically spends Christmas and New Year’s Eve, the president is just another guy in the buffet line.

        Orthodox Jews around the country — and specifically in the tri-state area — were still reeling from the shooting at a kosher deli earlier this month when we gathered with our families to celebrate the holiday of Chanukah. But that air of tranquility was shattered by a string of nearly a dozen anti-Semitic attacks over the holiday, the most severe of which was a mass stabbing at a rabbi’s home upstate as he lit his menorah.

The stabbing attack succeeded in bringing to the fore what we visibly Orthodox Jews have known for quite some time: There’s a growing epidemic of anti-Semitism in this country, specifically targeting Orthodox Jews,
