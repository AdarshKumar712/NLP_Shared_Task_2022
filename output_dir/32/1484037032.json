Email: lara.keay@mailonline.co.uk Advertisement\n\nSome households will now be forced to go four weeks without a recycling collection with many New Year's Day collections also being re-arranged and postponed.\n\nOne man who lives in Balsall Heath claims he had already seen rats chewing waste from split bin bags.\n\nHe said: 'It's an absolute disgrace that once again people in Birmingham are not having their rubbish collected.\n\nIn Birmingham, residents are still battling with post-Christmas rubbish after the scheduled collection date on Monday, December 30 was missed\n\nRubbish continues to go uncollected on the streets in Birmingham (left) as trolleys were left at recycling points in Cheshire laden with cardboard beer boxes (right)\n\nBirmingham City Council took to social media to blame staff sickness and absence for the missed pick-ups. Pictured: Residential street in Balsall Heath, Birmingham\n\n'I walked outside yesterday and saw two large rats chewing at a meat carcass that had spilled out of an over-filled bin bag.\n\n'It was like this when the bin men went on strike and now we're being told they had to reduce collections due to staff illness.\n\n'How convenient that so many staff go down with a bug over Christmas. It's disgusting.'\n\nAnother resident from Sparkbrook, just one mile from Balsall Heath, said that two large bins were overflowing to such an extent that it had created a grotesque arch of bursting black bags.\n\nShe said: 'It's a seriously grim sight at this time of year.\n\n'I refuse to let my children play outside in case they get bitten by vermin or fall over the piles of rubbish. The council are hopeless.'\n\nOne man who lives in Balsall Heath claims he had already seen rats chewing waste from split bin bags\n\nAnother resident in Birmingham said that two large bins were overflowing to such an extent that it had created a grotesque arch of bursting black bags\n\nBirmingham City Council took to social media to blame staff sickness and absence for the missed pick-ups.\n\nThe authority posted a tweet which read: 'Due to staff sickness/absence some bin rounds not completed today \u2013 apologies if yours was missed.\n\n'Please leave bins out. If not collected within 48hrs, take back in until next scheduled collection.'\n\nBirmingham City Council later encouraged residents to take their waste to the rubbish tip themselves which caused long delays at recycling plants\n\nFrustrated residents took to social media to demand a better service. Pictured: Residential street in Birmingham\n\nBut this was met with an angry response by residents who demanded a better service.\n\nOne user, @IainMGrant, replied: 'Just seen that you don't intend to collect our recycling until January 10.\n\n'Why is Birmingham City Council only collecting recycling once a month?'\n\nAnother, @Hexcaliber, wrote: 'You missed other collections too, our bins were already full prior to Christmas. A complete farce.'\n\nBirmingham City Council later encouraged residents to take their waste to the rubbish tip themselves.\n\nIt wrote: 'Planning a trip to the tip? We know some sites have been busy post-Christmas.\n\n'Our five household recycling centres are open daily this week (proof of Birmingham residence is required).'\n\nBut residents were once again left disgruntled after having to sit in queues for up to half an hour just to be able to get inside the plant.\n\nHuge piles of rubbish were also spotted yesterday as they swamped a Sainsbury's supermarket in Maypole, near Birmingham.\n\nResidents were forced to leave toy sets, wrapping paper and food waste strewn on the ground as there was no longer space in the allocated bins.\n\nResidents were once again left disgruntled after having to sit in queues for up to half an hour just to be able to get inside the recycling plants\n\nThese are just the latest in a long-line of contentions over Birmingham's waste collection system.\n\nAround 350 binmen, who are part of the Unite union, went on strike in February 2019 in an escalating dispute over pay.\n\nIt stemmed from claims that those who took part in an original period of walkouts over three months in 2017 had been 'blacklisted' and that those who had not, had received extra payments.\n\nA spokeswoman for Birmingham City Council said: 'In recent months, much positive progress had been made in respect of a reduced number of missed bin collections in the city.\n\n'In the seven working days before Christmas we had a daily average of 14 roads per day where collections were reported as dropped.\n\n'The festive period has always been a challenge with on average one third of extra waste collected each day. This stretches the service at a time when staff want time with their friends and families.\n\nPictured: A huge pile of Christmas rubbish and recycling that has formed at Sainsbury's in Maypole, near Birmingham\n\nThe huge pile of waste near Birmingham collected after services failed to collect the refuse following the festive period\n\n'In the first two days on which collections were scheduled after Christmas (December 30-31), we have had 276 dropped roads reported by our depots. This was due to a number of factors, the extra waste, access issues and staffing.\n\n'The performance immediately after Christmas is also despite the fact that crews previously working on the garden waste service have been kept on to strengthen the resources available for regular waste and recycling services at this peak time.\n\n'We would like to reiterate our apologies to households that have been affected and be assured we are making every effort to catch up as soon as possible.\n\n'If your bin is not collected within 48 hours of its scheduled collection, please take it back on to your property for collection on the next scheduled date for the type of bin/s in question.\n\n'An alternative for those with access to a vehicle is to visit one of our five Household Recycling Centres \u2013 but please be aware that as during any festive period, they can be busy at peak times.'\n\nA large plush Dulux-style dog is seen lording over the masses of cardboard boxes at the site near Sainsbury's in Maypole\n\nA spokesperson for Cheshire East Council said: 'Staff sickness during the holiday period has created some staff shortages and Ansa, the council's environmental services company, wishes to apologise to residents whose collections were missed.\n\n'We ask those households affected to leave their bins out so that their refuse can be collected as soon as possible.\n\n'Our household recycling centres have not been affected by the shortages and continued to operate normally in accordance with the publicised hours, only closing on Christmas Day itself.\n\n'As usual we experienced greater demand owing to the time of year, with no reports of any difficulties experienced by residents wishing to access this service.'\n\nHave you been affected by rubbish delays?
