(Photo: Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press)\n\nCommunity support for our work ensures that a free press matters and has a place in Michigan\u2019s future. This year, you helped expand a student journalism program, support workshops on the Freedom of Information Act, begin coverage of people returning home after serving time in prison, and more.\n\nFOIA workshops\n\nThe Free Press teamed up with Michigan Community Resources to host four workshops throughout the city of Detroit on the Michigan Freedom of Information Act. Michigan Community Resources works with local nonprofits to provide legal services, so it is in a unique position to see how organizations and individuals can use FOIA. Meanwhile, the Free Press uses the law every day, as it seeks public documents for its investigations and news stories. A grant by the Detroit Journalism Engagement Fund made this program possible. The fund, a partnership of the Community Foundation of Southeastern Michigan, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the Ford Foundation, aims to involve residents in telling the city\u2019s stories.\n\nRobin Luce Herrmann, who leads the media law practice at Butzel Long and works closely with the Michigan Press Association, anchored the events, with a presentation on how the Freedom of Information Act works in Michigan. For each panel, Robin was joined by Free Press journalists and local residents who talked about how they put the law into practice. Free Press reporter Kat Stafford and Senior Editor for Investigations Mark Rochester were among several journalists who offered their best tips, including:\n\nSee what you can find outside of a FOIA request to avoid fees\n\nUse a spreadsheet to keep track of every letter and response\n\nAsk to come in to review documents to avoid copying fees or ask for them in electronic form to lower copying fees\n\nNearly 200 residents took part. After each event, we offered to help them gather the information they need. In addition, we published an online primer on the Michigan Freedom of Information act at freep.com/foia.\n\n2019 Community Impact report: 15 Free Press stories that spurred real-world change\n\nReport for America\n\nThe Free Press seeks opportunities to augment its reporting through new funding sources. In 2019, the Free Press was one of more than 60 newsrooms across the country to receive support from the GroundTruth Project, a nonprofit journalism outfit that started Report for America to help fill coverage gaps across the country. Report for America funds a portion of a reporting fellowship and helps newsrooms raise money to fund the reporting.\n\nThrough the program, we brought on a Report for America corps member for a yearlong fellowship in the newsroom to cover the experiences of people who have been incarcerated and their families. Jail and prison time can create lifelong barriers to employment and housing, which are fundamental to rebuilding one\u2019s life. Angie Jackson, a Michigan native who most recently covered criminal justice issues in Charleston, S.C., is writing about the challenges returning citizens face with a focus on solutions that are in the works across the country. What started as a one-year reporting fellowship has expanded to two years thanks to support from the Detroit-based Hudson-Webber Foundation for this partnership.\n\nPaul Olden studies barber knowledge as he waits for a customer at Evolutions Barber and Beauty in Detroit, Tuesday, August 27, 2019. (Photo: Junfu Han, Detroit Free Press)\n\nFor 2020, the Free Press has support from Report for America to bring on two additional one-year reporting positions.\n\nOne reporter will focus on the issues and obstacles affecting economic mobility, primarily in Detroit. This wide-ranging beat will bolster the Free Press' coverage of housing and water affordability and issues important to small business owners.\n\nFor a second new one-year position, the Free Press is teaming up with PolitiFact to train a reporter who will fact-check claims made in the 2020 elections.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to support any of these reporting positions, please contact Jewel Gopwani, the Free Press\u2019 senior editor for engagement and events, at jgopwani@freepress.com. The Free Press maintains editorial control of this coverage and all other funded projects.\n\nSummer Apprentice Program\n\nThe Free Press Summer Apprentice Program brings high school students from across metro Detroit to work in the Detroit Free Press newsroom for six weeks. Throughout the program we provide training for students, who are placed in departments across the newsroom. Each student gets a mentor and an editor. After receiving training, they get assignments and make story pitches just like any other Free Press staffer. Students leave the program with writing samples, newsroom experience and a network of journalists who can be mentors throughout their careers. Over the years, many Free Press apprentices have returned to the newsroom for internships and full-time jobs. The Apprentice Program has long benefited from in-kind support from Wayne State University's Journalism Institute for Media Diversity and the program expanded in 2019 thanks to support from the Lipinski Journalism Fund at The Michigan Daily.\n\nThe 2019 Detroit Free Press Summer Apprentices, sponsored by The Michigan Daily, is photographed in the offices of the Free Press on Tuesday, June 25, 2019. (Photo: Kimberly P. Mitchell, Detroit Free Press)\n\nHere's what two apprentices had to say about their experiences in the program:\n\n\u201cI will never forget my second day in the newsroom, when my editor sent me an assignment to cover a Wayne County Ethics Board hearing at nine that morning. I learned so much about the news cycle in general \u2014 how to combine efficiency, timeliness and quality reporting \u2014 but also gleaned some finer points like how to chase after and approach a lawyer for further statements and how to make observations into an investigative tip. Through this, I worked with a great mentor who exposed me to many skills of the trade. And it was the greatest surprise of all to learn that it would be a front-page story the next day! At risk of sounding clich\u00e9, this was an opportunity that has defined me not only as a student journalist, but as a person.\u201d \u2014 Julie Heng, senior, Huron High School \u201cBefore the program, journalism was just something I could follow in high school. But now I have the experience and knowledge to pursue my dream for the rest of my life. \u2026 I really appreciate you giving me the chance to prove, to myself, that I have what it takes to be on this level.\u201d \u2014Grace Osmialowski, senior South Lake High School\n\nTo support the Apprentice Program, please reach out to Jewel Gopwani, senior editor for engagement and events, at jgopwani@freepress.com.\n\nThank you to our funders and supporters\n\nCommunity Foundation for Southeast Michigan\n\nJohn S. and James L.
