This is an area that has offered support several times in the past so the most likely scenario is that we would get a bit of a bounce. If we do get that bounce, then it is probably going to go looking towards the \u00a5109.50 level. That being said, it won\u2019t necessarily be easy to deal with, and I think at this point it\u2019s very likely that we will see players come in and try to support this market. However, if we do not then the market could find itself reaching towards the \u00a5107 level over the next several trading sessions.\n\nKeep in mind that there is a bit of \u201cend of the year\u201d bookkeeping going on as well, so you can only read so much into this as far as the short term is concerned. With that being the case, I like the idea of playing it for a bounce but probably later this week, not necessarily the first chance I get. Ranges last until they don\u2019t, and while that seems a bit curt, the reality is that it\u2019s very true. Ultimately, this is a market that has a serious decision relatively soon, so pay attention over the next couple of days, because you will have a bit of time to make this decision. With that being said, be cautious but pay attention as we are about to get a nice signal.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://vixc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cropped-VixcNews_Logo.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "http://vixc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ecc844c58cac33561cf47acdaaa30e1b"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://vixc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cropped-VixcNews_Logo.png"}, "canonical_link": ""}
