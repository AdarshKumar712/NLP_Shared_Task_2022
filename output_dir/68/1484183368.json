We'd made thousands of dollars before 8am this morning and we've sold out of all the stock that we had of that style (the Cocobear).\"\n\nSUSSEXROYAL / INSTAGRAM In the picture posted as part of the Sussexes' New Years Message, Archie wears a hat made by Kiwi social enterprise Make Give Live.\n\nA person involved with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's tour to New Zealand last year approached Make Give Live for a hat to gift to the royal couple while the Duchess of Sussex was pregnant with Archie.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex share new picture of Archie\n\n* Tiny home let Mum keep loneliness-busting social enterprise running\n\n* Prince Harry reveals that baby Archie inherited his famous red hair\n\n* Help needed to distribute nearly 2000 woolly hats to kids in need\n\n* Handmade beanies for people in need\n\nAt the time, however, Conza wasn't even sure if the Sussexes would receive the hat due to strict rules around what kinds of gifts the royal family can accept.\n\n\"I'd kind of almost forgotten about it until yesterday,\" she confessed.\n\nMATTHEW CATTIN/FAIRFAX NZ Make Give Live founder Claire Conza was as surprised as anyone to see Archie wearing one of her hats.\n\nShe thought Make Give Live, which aims to tackle isolation and mental illness by bringing people together to knit and crochet hats and other items, one of which is then donated to charity for each item sold, would appeal to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex because of their commitment to mental health advocacy.\n\nBut she \"never imagined\" that they would give her little social enterprise such a huge global platform.\n\n\"I almost can't even comprehend what it means,\" she said.\n\nThe rush of orders came as a particular surprise because up until now Make Give Live had been focusing on building a wholesale business rather than online sales.\n\nSo this morning, Conza had kicked into action.\n\nShe had purchased literally all the wool that her supplier had available, which was about 400 balls, or around 600 beanies' worth.\n\n\"I don't think it's really going to make a dent though,\" Conza admitted.\n\nHer other challenge was finding enough knitters to fulfil 200 per cent of all of the orders - one for the customer and one for charity.\n\nMake Give Live currently has 125 people working in 11 groups, but Conza there were also about 200 people who were on waiting lists, wanting to get involved.\n\nSupplied The Make Give Live \"Cocobear\" beanie worn by Archie has now sold out.\n\nAnd while the influx of orders had taken Make Give Live utterly by surprise, Conza was excited by the chance to expand the benefits of the social enterprise.\n\n\"We know from our makers how, in some cases, life-changing and life-saving it has been - something as simple as being in a group of people who care about each other and become like your family, and just enjoying the therapy of the knitting and crochet.\"\n\nIt could even present the opportunity to expand internationally, something Conza said she had been approached about before.\n\n\"Isolation and mental illness are global problems, and social connection and knitting and crochet are a global solution,\" she said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Emily Brookes"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Make Give Live has seen its Cocobear hat sell out before 8am after Harry and Meghan's Instagram post.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/sics-assets/images/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "noarchive", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "fb": {"app_id": 207633159308175, "pages": 21253884267}, "verify-v1": "RazNiYjuvNuEsMeFXxfR9l9cDZIKxcq2VjQZA25CHgM=", "msapplication-config": "/sics-assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "Make Give Live has seen its Cocobear hat sell out before 8am after Harry and Meghan's Instagram post.", "source": "Stuff", "og": {"description": "Make Give Live has seen its Cocobear hat sell out before 8am after Harry and Meghan's Instagram post.", "title": "Kiwi group Make Give Live overwhelmed by orders after Archie wears their hat", "url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/life/118554872/kiwi-group-make-give-live-overwhelmed-by-orders-after-archie-wears-their-hat", "type": "article", "image": "https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/y/k/w/7/4/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1yl1iw.png/1577929435233.jpg", "keywords": "famous, CHARITY, one, WOOL, Online, Prince, This, people, HAIR, GIFT, Manufacturer, Mum, more, Who, RUNNING, family, Prince Harry, BUSINESS, zealand, Know, Picture, Royal Family, Baby, Tackle, Media, Flying, THERAPY, HEALTH, New, Mental Health, KNITTING, Social Media, available, Rules, morning, STYLE, Mental illness, HOME, PREGNANT, ROYAL, Instagram, New Zealand, keep, PHOTO, SMITH", "site_name": "Stuff"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/life/118554872/kiwi-group-make-give-live-overwhelmed-by-orders-after-archie-wears-their-hat"}
