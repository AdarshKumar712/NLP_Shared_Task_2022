The 2020 Rose Parade is slated to start in less than three hours. Here is what you need to know to prepare for, watch and enjoy Pasadena\u2019s most colorful annual spectacle.\n\nTime and location\n\nThe Rose Parade rolls at 8 a.m. starting from the corner of Green Street and Orange Grove Boulevard. For most of the 5.5-mile route, the floats will travel along Colorado Boulevard, where thousands of spectators will be stationed for the best views.\n\nExpect big crowds. Nearly 800,000 people are expected to attend the Rose Parade and the Rose Bowl, both organized by the Tournament of Roses Association. Special security will be in place to protect the throngs.\n\nPublic transportation, parking and road closures\n\nThe Gold Line has several stops near the parade route: Del Mar, Memorial Park, Lake and Allen stations. Umbrellas, chairs and coolers will not be permitted on the trains. Roundtrip fare is $3.50.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOvernight street parking begins at noon on Dec. 31, for that evening only. No parking is allowed along the route. Paid parking is available at lots and structures near the route.\n\nStarting Tuesday night, several streets in the Pasadena area will be closed. The California Department of Transportation will also close or restrict off-ramps and on-ramps of the 710, 210, 134 and 110 freeways.\n\nWeather\n\nThe day may start off chilly, so if you arrive before sunrise, you may want to bring some mittens or gloves. But temperatures are expected to reach the mid-60s by the afternoon, with skies clear and mostly sunny. Santa Ana winds on Tuesday are expected to weaken by Wednesday.\n\nCosts\n\nCurbside, it\u2019s first-come, first-served to grab a spot to watch the parade. The die-hard fans will have camped out overnight for a front-row seat.\n\nGrandstand seating is available through Dec. 31. Tickets range from $60 to $110 and can be purchased from sharpseating.com.\n\nSafety\n\nOfficers from the Pasadena Police Department \u2014 and their canine units \u2014 will be out in full force to manage public safety during the parade.\n\nOvernight camping is only permitted on the night of Tuesday, Dec. 31.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTents, sofas, boxes, unoccupied seats, ladders and scaffolding are not allowed along the parade route. Bonfires are strictly prohibited and considered \u201cillegal burns,\u201d punishable by a fine and/or jail time. Fireworks are also banned.\n\nFor up-to-date text message alerts from public safety officials, text ROSEPARADE to 888777.\n\nChannels\n\nIf you decide to skip the crowds and watch the parade from the comfort of your home, these channels will have a live broadcast beginning at 8 a.m. PST:\n\nABC-7\n\nKTLA-5\n\nNBC-4\n\nUnivision\n\nThe Hallmark Channel\n\nFunny or Die\u2019s \u201cRose Parade Live With Cord & Tish,\u201d will apparently not be streaming this year. It\u2019s a blow for all those who love Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon\u2019s satirical take on live parade coverage \u2014 and the reactions from Twitter users who aren\u2019t in on the joke.\n\nGrand marshal and theme\n\nThis year, there are three Rose Parade grand marshals: Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez, actress Gina Torres and performer Rita Moreno.\n\nRita Moreno. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)\n\nMoreno is distinguished for being one of a handful of people who have achieved an EGOT: She has won Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.\n\nThe parade\u2019s theme this year is \u201cThe Power of Hope.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnjoy the parade.
