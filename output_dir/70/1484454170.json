The Orthodox faction has condemned the move, saying it is not in accordance with the Supreme Court verdict and is an attempt to bring in parallel administration in churches.The cabinet has sent the ordinance for the consideration of the governor. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters that the ordinance would ensure the right of any family of a parish to bury bodies of its family members in the cemetery of the church where their family tomb is situated, irrespective of any objection or dispute. If there is no family tomb, a believer\u2019s body will be buried in the cemetery of his/her parish church.Vijayan said the ordinance would also allow the family of the deceased to conduct the post-death rituals anywhere outside the church or cemetery by a priest of their choice. The provision will allow a family to perform the final rites at a Jacobite church and conduct the burial in an Orthodox church where the family tomb is situated and vice versa.He said the government had to take the decision as the cabinet subcommittee that was formed to resolve the disputes between the Orthodox and Jacobite factions could not succeed in its efforts.\u201cOne of the factions refused to even discuss the matter with the sub-committee. There is nothing illegal in the ordinance. The usual custom is that a body should be buried at the earliest and when one section decides not to concede to any solution, the government cannot be a mute spectator. We are also not going against anything ruled by the Supreme Court,\u201d the chief minister said.The Jacobite Church has welcomed the move but Orthodox Church episcopal synod secretary Metropolitan Yuhanon Mar Diascoros said the clause in the ordinance that anyone can cremate the body of a parish member in the cemetery cannot be approved.\u201cThe right for getting buried in a cemetery belonging to Orthodox Church is only for those belonging to the parish church. The vicar of the parish is in charge of the cemetery. The clause allowing anyone to enter the cemetery and bury the dead is a violation of the Supreme Court verdict. The Supreme Court had made it clear that it will not allow parallel rule in the cemetery. Burying bodes in the cemetery without the permission of priests who have officially become the vicars through the court judgment will create anarchy,\u201d he said.The cabinet also decided to re-promulgate the Kerala education (amendment) ordinance 2019, the Kerala devaswom recruitment board (amendment) ordinance 2019, the Kerala state goods and services tax (amendment) ordinance and the Kerala minerals ordinance.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Thiruvananthapuram news", "Thiruvananthapuram latest news", "Thiruvananthapuram news live", "Thiruvananthapuram news today", "Today news Thiruvananthapuram", "thiruvananthapuram", "Privileges or Immunities Clause", "pinarayi vijayan", "Kerala", "cemetery"], "tags": ["Delhi Temperature", "Hyderabad Rain", "Fire in Mumbai", "Srinagar encounter", "Pinarayi Vijayan", "Mumbai Rains", "Delhi Air Pollution", "cemetery", "Chennai Weather", "Bangalore Temperature", "Delhi Smog"], "authors": ["Tnn"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "In a bid to resolve disputes over burial of bodies in churches under the possession of Jacobite and Orthodox factions, the state cabinet on Wednesday", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "In a bid to resolve disputes over burial of bodies in churches under the possession of Jacobite and Orthodox factions, the state cabinet on Wednesday", "keywords": "Thiruvananthapuram news, Thiruvananthapuram latest news, Thiruvananthapuram news live, Thiruvananthapuram news today, Today news Thiruvananthapuram,thiruvananthapuram,Privileges or Immunities Clause,pinarayi vijayan,Kerala,cemetery", "robots": "NOODP", "og": {"title": "Ordinance to allow Jacobite burials in Orthodox churches, vice versa | Thiruvananthapuram News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/ordinance-to-allow-jacobite-burials-in-orthodox-churches-vice-versa/articleshow/73063486.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063478,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-29160,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "In a bid to resolve disputes over burial of bodies in churches under the possession of Jacobite and Orthodox factions, the state cabinet on Wednesday", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/ordinance-to-allow-jacobite-burials-in-orthodox-churches-vice-versa/articleshow/73063486.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063478,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-29160,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "Ordinance to allow Jacobite burials in Orthodox churches, vice versa | Thiruvananthapuram News - Times of India", "description": "In a bid to resolve disputes over burial of bodies in churches under the possession of Jacobite and Orthodox factions, the state cabinet on Wednesday", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "news_keywords": "thiruvananthapuram,Privileges or Immunities Clause,pinarayi vijayan,Kerala,cemetery", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/ordinance-to-allow-jacobite-burials-in-orthodox-churches-vice-versa/articleshow/73063486.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 227797153941209, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/ordinance-to-allow-jacobite-burials-in-orthodox-churches-vice-versa/articleshow/73063486.cms"}
