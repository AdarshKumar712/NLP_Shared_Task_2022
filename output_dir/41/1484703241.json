Kilbourn Ave. The hotel features several galleries, a performing arts theater, approximately two dozen pieces of artwork in each of its 219 rooms, a caf\u00e9, fast casual pizza restaurant, a champagne and wine bar, and live entertainment. One of South Milwaukee\u2019s most famous residents, wrestling great Reggie Lisowski, aka \u201cDa Crusher\u201d was honored with a life-size bronze statue this summer. The statue was unveiled June 8 at 1101 Milwaukee Ave. in South Milwaukee during \u201cCrusher Fest,\u201d a two-day celebration featuring appearances by Lisowski\u2019s wrestling contemporaries, food, beer, and plenty of polka. Sculpture Milwaukee, a four-month-long outdoor exhibition featuring the work of 22 artists, including Max Ernst, Red Grooms, Roxy Paine, and Richard Woods, returned to downtown Milwaukee for its third year. Works were displayed June through October. Jeff Redmon and his wife, Dana, opened Scout Gallery, a 5,800-square-foot space at 1104 W. Historic Mitchell St., in June. The gallery includes a retail space which sells work by local artists at many different price points. Earlier this year, the Museum of Wisconsin Art (MOWA) in West Bend acquired a valuable painting by Wisconsin landscape artist Tom Uttech. The oil-on-linen painting, \u201cNIN GASSINSIBINGWE\u201d, is part of Uttech\u2019s Migration series, which features birds and mammals migrating through Wisconsin\u2019s North Woods and parts of Ontario, Canada. Uttech\u2019s retrospective exhibit, Into the Woods, will be on display at the MOWA through January 12. In July, the Milwaukee Artist Resource Network (MARN) became the recipient of a $3,000,000 grant, courtesy of the Anonymous Fund at the Greater Milwaukee Foundation, allowing the organization to expand its programming and move into a new operating space. In October, MARN relocated to a 5,200-square-foot space, which includes a gallery, retail storefront, and events space, at Lofts on Broadway, 191 N. Broadway. RedLine Milwaukee, a nonprofit group and gallery space dedicated to supporting Milwaukee artists, closed its location, 1422 N. 4th St., in July, after a decade of operation. The East Tosa mural project, featuring six vibrant murals painted on North Avenue businesses in Wauwatosa, was completed in July. Wauwatosa alderman Joel Tilleson, who founded the project, said that the city will continue to focus on promoting public art. This summer, a Third Ward mural painted on the north side of the Dye House building, 230 E. Buffalo St., was a subject of controversy. Created by German muralist Andreas Von Chrzanowski (CASE Maclaim) the mural depicts a headless woman wearing a white utility apron with her hands folded. While some feel the mural honors working women in general, others argue the mural implies these workers are disposable. Under One Moon festival, an outdoor event celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, was held in the Third Ward August 9 through 11. The event included lunar-themed music, dance and art, and showcased Museum of the Moon, British artist Luke Jerram\u2019s 23-foot-wide inflatable art installation.\n\nArt Events and Gallery Openings\n\nWednesday, 1:30 p.m.:\n\nA \u201cNew Year\u2019s Resolution Drop-In Tour\u201d will be held at the Milwaukee Art Museum (MAM).\n\nThursday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nThe MAM will host its free First Thursday.
