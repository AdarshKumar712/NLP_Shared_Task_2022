It is also a time for resolutions, to be kept or not, and for such adventures as a Dry January after so much Christmas overindulgence.\n\nIt is also an opportunity to take stock of where we are now. In 2010 the political situation was not perfect, but Stormont was running and the political institutions were bedding in. Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness were working together in a partnership which now seems like a halcyon period of bridge-building.\n\nWe now have the benefit of 20/20 hindsight and we see the roots that were eventually to choke the Assembly. These included the failure to follow through on political agreements, and a growing lack of trust.\n\nThis led to the present long impasse, with the scandal of RHI, the decisions - or lack of them - which led to the NHS crisis, and the conspicuous failure to remove the gun from politics once and for all.\n\nThere was also the significant inability of our politicians to grasp the full implications of Brexit, well before the 2016 Referendum. No one is saying that they bear full responsibility for the current Brexit plague on all our houses, but they stand accused of not giving better leadership.\n\nThe past decade was also a time when we learned slowly and painfully that we are on our own and the outside world, not unreasonably, expects us to show that we can stand on our own two feet.\n\nHowever, it is not all bad news. These are exciting times for Ulster University in developing its new Belfast campus, and for Queen's University with its important scientific developments.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["belfasttelegraph"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Some people like New Year's Eve while others loathe it, both for the same reason, as it is a time for reflection.
