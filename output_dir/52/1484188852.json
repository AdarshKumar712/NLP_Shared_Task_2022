It is currently dedicated to the memory of Arthur Griffth, Michael Collins and Kevin O\u2019Higgins, three of the most prominent pro-Treaty politicians.\n\nHowever, the memorial is within the grounds of Leinster House and is not open to the public.\n\nDr Manning said the group is open to consideration for a public memorial either there or in a different place.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m keen that there be a public debate on this. What form should the memorial take? We should have a debate if the Leinster Lawn is suitable or some other place. I think it is much more practical to think anew,\u201d he suggested.\n\n\u201cIs it a good idea to commission a permanent memorial to all those who died in the Civil War. The idea of a day of reconciliation is a good idea, but how do you structure it?\u201d\n\nDr Manning said now is the right time to commemorate the Civil War as the bitterness had dissipated over the last almost 100 years.\n\nIn its guidance to the Government on the second half of the decade of centenarries, the advisory group recommended the State should take a \u201creflective and reconciliatory tone\u201d in relation to the Civil War that recognises \u201cneither side had the monopoly of either atrocity or virtue and this was true of words as well as actions.\u201d\n\nIt said the silences that followed the Civil War could now be replaced by \u201cmeaningful engagements with a difficult and traumatic time\u201d.\n\nIt went on to state the consequences of the actions on all sides, and the depth, sincerity, or sometimes anger and sense of retribution underpinning those actions, needs to be confronted as part of any meaningful commemoration.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Government advisory body recommends consideration for a permanent memorial", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/assets/images/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "Government advisory body recommends consideration for a permanent memorial", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14128212"}, "news_keywords": "News, Arthur Griffth, Kevin O Higgins, Maurice Manning, Michael Collins, Ronan Mcgreevy, Leinster", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "Call for Civil War to be remembered with memorial to all victims", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/call-for-civil-war-to-be-remembered-with-memorial-to-all-victims-1.4128212", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "Government advisory body recommends consideration for a permanent memorial", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4128211&origw=1440", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4128211&origw=1440", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimes", "creator": "@RMcGreevy1301", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/call-for-civil-war-to-be-remembered-with-memorial-to-all-victims-1.4128212", "title": "Call for Civil War to be remembered with memorial to all victims", "description": "Government advisory body recommends consideration for a permanent memorial", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128211.1577885126!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/call-for-civil-war-to-be-remembered-with-memorial-to-all-victims-1.4128212"}
