When a friend asked my advice on returning to work, I told her the wisest course of action was to lower her standards at home.\n\nThat might sound a little dismal, but bear with me.\n\nI have learned that it simply isn\u2019t possible to keep on top of the washing, be present as a mum, hoover the stairs and clean out the vegetable drawer in the fridge.\n\nI reason that as long as the house is vaguely clean, the rest of the chaos can wait.\n\nI have been known to batch cook at 10pm, in the hope that it would somehow make me a better mum.\n\nIt led to a surplus of soup and partly burned lasagne, alongside a mountain of washing up.\n\nAlthough mum guilt still snaps at my heels most days, I am secure in the knowledge that I have been a fairly decent parent thus far.\n\nThere is, however, one change, which should hopefully be occurring in our household.\n\nNo, not baby number two \u2013 we\u2019re still recovering from a solid year of sleep deprivation.\n\nInstead, I hope that 2020 will see me spend a lot more time with my other half.\n\nIt has often struck me that we are like ships in the night, discussing little else except Reuben and whose turn it is to walk the dog.\n\nIn the early days, our life revolved around our new addition.\n\nBut Reuben is no longer a tiny bundle clasped to my chest.\n\nIt is perhaps time that I cut the apron strings ever so slightly and enjoy the odd meal out which doesn\u2019t include crayons and a high chair.\n\nIt is difficult not to be totally consumed by the feat which is taking care of a young child, with their many milestones and somewhat maddening phases.\n\nBut in dedicating every spare second to our son, we have forgotten to take time for ourselves.\n\nYou cannot expect to continue as normal upon having a baby, but nor can you risk losing each other completely.\n\nWe have vowed to go out once a month, and discuss something other than potty training and the latest episode of Peppa Pig.\n\nWe may well fall asleep before dessert, but the thought is there.\n\nMy other half has a dry sense of humour, a secret love of history and possesses endless patience. He is also notoriously private, and he therefore dreads this column.\n\nBut here it is in black and white, my resolution to catch up with the person who has held my hand through the onslaught of 2019.\n\nThe date is firmly set in the diary, although the choice of restaurant is still in debate.\n\nSo if you can recommend the perfect venue for two knackered parents, let me know.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["motherhood", "Money Matters", "diary of a first-time mum", "NY resolutions", "Family", "column", "columnist", "HELIMED 79", "BREXIT"], "authors": ["Ellie House"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 06:45:39 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/cropped-favicon-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Diary of a first-time-mum: Be more than passing ships - the main resolution I hope to keep | Press and Journal", "description": "As we start a new year, people tend to look back and reflect on what has passed.", "url": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/lifestyle/lifestyle-columnists/1923712/diary-of-a-first-time-mum-be-more-than-passing-ships-the-main-resolution-i-hope-to-keep/", "site_name": "Press and Journal", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/5e0902660866a7.45755714-e1577702896271-802x564.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/5e0902660866a7.45755714-e1577702896271-802x564.jpg", "width": 802, "height": 564}}, "article": {"tag": "NY resolutions", "section": "Feature columnists"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "As we start a new year, people tend to look back and reflect on what has passed.", "title": "Diary of a first-time-mum: Be more than passing ships - the main resolution I hope to keep | Press and Journal", "site": "@pressjournal", "image": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/5e0902660866a7.45755714-e1577702896271-802x564.jpg", "creator": "@ellie_journo"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "golden-content": "false", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-01 06:45:39", "sailthru.title": "Diary of a first-time-mum: Be more than passing ships \u2013 the main resolution I hope to keep", "sailthru.tags": "press-and-journal, column, columnist, diary of a first-time mum, Family, motherhood, NY resolutions, Lifestyle, Feature columnists", "sailthru.author": "Ellie House", "sailthru.description": "As we start a new year, people tend to look back and reflect on what has passed.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/5e0902660866a7.45755714-e1577702896271.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/5e0902660866a7.45755714-e1577702896271-140x84.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-thumbnail": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/5e0902660866a7.45755714-e1577702896271-140x84.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-medium": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/5e0902660866a7.45755714-e1577702896271-256x180.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-large": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/5e0902660866a7.45755714-e1577702896271-802x564.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-full": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/5e0902660866a7.45755714-e1577702896271.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/cropped-favicon-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/lifestyle/lifestyle-columnists/1923712/diary-of-a-first-time-mum-be-more-than-passing-ships-the-main-resolution-i-hope-to-keep/"}
