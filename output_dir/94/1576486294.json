Kataeb Hezbollah, the U.S. Department of Defense noted in a statement on the airstrikes, has \u201ca strong linkage\u201d with Iran\u2019s Quds Force, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department.\n\nIn retaliation for the airstrikes, which killed some 25 of the militia\u2019s fighters, hundreds of supporters of the Iran-backed group converged on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday, with dozens breaking into the compound and setting fires amid shouts of \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel.\u201d\n\nTrump responded by blaming Iran and vowing to take action. \u201cIran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday, adding in another post: \u201cIran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Khamenei made his first public remarks about the attack on the embassy by tauntingly responding to Trump\u2019s threat.\n\n\u201cThat guy has tweeted that we [the United States] see Iran responsible for the events in Baghdad and we will respond to Iran,\u201d Khamenei said in a televised address on state-controlled TV Wednesday, as reported by The Daily Mail.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, you can\u2019t do a damn thing! This has nothing to do with Iran,\u201d Khamenei continued. \u201cSecondly, be logical\u2026The people of this region hate America. Why don\u2019t Americans understand this? You Americans have committed crimes in Iraq, you have committed crimes in Afghanistan. You have killed people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Islamic Republic decides to oppose or fight against a country, it will do this explicitly,\u201d said the leader.\n\nLate Tuesday, the Defense Department announced that Trump has deployed 750 U.S. soldiers to the region and has ordered an additional 3,000 or so to prepare for potential deployment in the coming days.\n\nIn a press statement issued Tuesday night, Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced that he has ordered the immediate deployment of 750 soldiers from the Army\u2019s 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The full brigade, which consists of about 4,000 soldiers, is preparing for potential deployment.\n\n\u201cThis deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against U.S. personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad today,\u201d Esper said in the statement.\n\nDuring an impromptu press conference Tuesday evening, Trump was asked if he could \u201cforesee going to war with Iran.\u201d\u201dI don\u2019t think that would be a good idea for Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t last very long. Do I want to? No. I want to have peace. I like peace. And Iran should want peace more than anybody. So I don\u2019t see that happening. No, I don\u2019t think Iran would want that to happen. It would go very quickly.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["featured", "News"], "authors": ["Chief Editor"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 21:47:28 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://conservativefighters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Faviconconservativefighters.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://conservativefighters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-6.jpg", "secure_url": "https://conservativefighters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-6.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://conservativefighters.org/news/iranian-leader-to-trump-you-cant-do-a-damn-thing-trump-deploys-troops/", "title": "Iranian Leader To Trump: \u2018You Can\u2019t Do A Damn Thing\u2019; Trump Deploys Troops", "description": "After hundreds of supporters of an Iran-backed Shiite Iraqi militia stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday, President Trump pointed squarely at Iran, accusing the country \u2014 the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism \u2014 of \u201corchestrating\u201d the attack and promising that Iran \u201cwill be held fully responsible.\u201d Iran\u2019s leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded \u2026", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Conservative Fighters", "updated_time": "2020-01-01T22:37:01+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://conservativefighters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-6.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://conservativefighters.org/news/iranian-leader-to-trump-you-cant-do-a-damn-thing-trump-deploys-troops/", "title": "Iranian Leader To Trump: \u2018You Can\u2019t Do A Damn Thing\u2019; Trump Deploys Troops", "description": "After hundreds of supporters of an Iran-backed Shiite Iraqi militia stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday, President Trump pointed squarely at Iran, accusing the country \u2014 the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism \u2014 of \u201corchestrating\u201d the attack and promising that Iran \u201cwill be held fully responsible.\u201d Iran\u2019s leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded [\u2026]"}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Conservative-Fighters-1125333984241125/", "tag": "News", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T21:47:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T22:37:01+00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://conservativefighters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Faviconconservativefighters.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://conservativefighters.org/news/iranian-leader-to-trump-you-cant-do-a-damn-thing-trump-deploys-troops/"}
