Schneider, of Plover, Wisconsin, and 22-year-old passenger Olivia Johnson, a former University of Minnesota student who worked as an intern in the Star Tribune newsroom, the newspaper reported.\n\nAuthorities say Schneider was heading west on Hwy. 70, lost control of her car and crossed into the path of the eastbound semi. Two people in the semi escaped serious injuries.\n\nAt the time of her death, Johnson was a news reporter for the News & Advance in Lynchburg, Virginia. Previously, she spent three years as a reporter and editor at the University of Minnesota Daily, and one semester each as a reporting intern for the Star Tribune\u2019s business section in the first half of 2018 and for the St. Paul Pioneer Press in late 2017.\n\nSchneider was a classmate of Johnson\u2019s at the University of Minnesota and worked in marketing at Warner Bros.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.
