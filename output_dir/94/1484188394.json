With the new Oakland taproom, which opened this month and is called the House of Perpetual Refreshment, it\u2019s delivering on both.\n\nLocated a few blocks from Lake Merritt, the House of Perpetual Refreshment comprises 4,000 square feet of hot pink, teal and orange walls splashed with geometric patterns. Expect to see a mix of year-round, seasonal and special release beers across its 34 taps, plus house-roasted cold brew coffee, Modern Times\u2019 own ciders and Bubble Party, the brewery\u2019s non-alcoholic fizzy grapefruit option.\n\nSince its founding in 2013, Modern Times has done things a little differently.\n\nIt has emphasized art not normally seen in typically minimalist, industrial breweries \u2014 like a ceiling covered in lamp shades or a mosaic of Michael Jackson made of thousands of Post-It notes. The brewery has put just as much effort into its fruited sours as its hoppy IPAs and named its taprooms cheeky things like \u201cthe Academy of Recreational Sciences.\u201d\n\nInstead of teaming up with food trucks or offering typical pub grub, it opened ambitious vegan restaurants within several of its taprooms. It started roasting its own coffee, opening a combination brewery-coffee shop in Los Angeles. And in 2017, it became California\u2019s first employee-owned brewery.\n\nAt the Oakland location, there is no food, though customers can bring in snacks or even get pizza delivered. A mini-mart sells swag, to-go cans of beer and bags of coffee beans. The taproom also fills crowlers and growlers.\n\nWhile some of Modern Times\u2019 other six locations \u2014 spread across California as well as Portland, Ore. \u2014 are known for a single huge art installation, the Oakland space features wall-to-wall works with a focus on color. Modern Times spokesperson Dan Reed said via email that there are hidden Easter eggs sprinkled throughout, \u201cresulting in a super-vibrant, joyous environment that reveals new secrets with each visit.\u201d\n\nThe House of Perpetual Refreshment. Open noon-10 p.m. Mon.-Thurs., noon-midnight Fri., 11 a.m.-midnight Sat., 11 a.m.-10 p.m. Sun. 2410 Valdez St., Oakland. 510-545-4191 or www.moderntimesbeer.com\n\nJanelle Bitker is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
