The U.S. company also uses its own graphics processors in the Apple Watch. It told Imagination Technologies in 2017 that it would stop using its intellectual property in new products within two years.\n\nWhen Imagination Technologies, then a public company, announced the loss of Apple as its biggest customer, its stock plummeted. The British company said in 2018 there may be \u201cmaterial uncertainty\" regarding the future of the company if Apple doesn\u2019t pay any royalties on its latest generation of iPhones and iPads. It\u2019s unclear if Apple has paid those fees, but Imagination has argued it would be \u201cextremely challenging for Apple to design a GPU in a way that allows them not to pay royalties to Imagination.\"\n\nThe company didn\u2019t specify on Thursday which intellectual property the latest agreement covers, but Imagination\u2019s IP related to graphics and artificial intelligence could be key to future Apple devices. The iPhone maker uses a combination of supplier deals and acquisitions to build up its portfolio of patents and designs. Last year, Apple acquired Intel Corp.\u2019s modem unit to design cellular chips for future devices.\n\n\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Apple", "Apple  iPhones", "Apple iPads", "iPhone X", "Intel Corp.", "iPhone maker"], "tags": ["Mint 50 - Top Mutual Funds", "Business of Entertainment", "Brand Masters", "Ayodhya Verdict", "Long Story Capsule", "Market Analysis", "Start-Up Diaries", "Apple", "Plain Facts", "Why Not Mint Money", "Long Reads", "5G Tech", "Mint Insight", "Money With Monika", "Digital Gurus", "NRI Investment Queries", "Mint Explainers", "Mint Views", "Foldable Smartphones"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 08:59:47 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The iPhone maker uses a combination of supplier deals and acquisitions to build up its portfolio of patents and designs.Last year, Apple acquired Intel Corp.\u2019s modem unit to design cellular chips for future devices.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://images.livemint.com/rw/PortalConfig/LiveMint/static_content/images/v2/livemint_favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The iPhone maker uses a combination of supplier deals and acquisitions to build up its portfolio of patents and designs.Last year, Apple acquired Intel Corp.\u2019s modem unit to design cellular chips for future devices.", "keywords": "Apple,Apple  iPhones,Apple iPads,iPhone X,Intel Corp.,iPhone maker", "news_keywords": "Apple,Apple  iPhones,Apple iPads,iPhone X,Intel Corp.,iPhone maker", "og": {"title": "Apple strikes new deal with UK chipmaker it sidelined in 2017", "image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2020/01/02/600x338/2019-12-23T172354Z_1_LYNXMPEFBM19C_RTROPTP_3_TECH-SUPPLIES-SAMSUNG-APPLE_1577181635120_1577935686518.JPG", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/apple-strikes-new-deal-with-uk-chipmaker-it-sidelined-in-2017-11577935407183.html", "site_name": "Livemint", "description": "The iPhone maker uses a combination of supplier deals and acquisitions to build up its portfolio of patents and designs.Last year, Apple acquired Intel Corp.\u2019s modem unit to design cellular chips for future devices."}, "tweetmeme-title": "Apple strikes new deal with UK chipmaker it sidelined in 2017", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@livemint", "domain": "livemint.com", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/apple-strikes-new-deal-with-uk-chipmaker-it-sidelined-in-2017-11577935407183.html", "title": "Apple strikes new deal with UK chipmaker it sidelined in 2017", "description": "The iPhone maker uses a combination of supplier deals and acquisitions to build up its portfolio of patents and designs.Last year, Apple acquired Intel Corp.\u2019s modem unit to design cellular chips for future devices.", "image": {"src": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2020/01/02/600x338/2019-12-23T172354Z_1_LYNXMPEFBM19C_RTROPTP_3_TECH-SUPPLIES-SAMSUNG-APPLE_1577181635120_1577935686518.JPG"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-02T08:59:47+05:30", "section": "Companies", "tag": "Apple"}, "Last-Modified": "2020-01-02T08:59:48+05:30", "Last-Modified-Date": "Thu, Jan 02, 2020", "Last-Modified-Time": "2020-01-02T08:59:48+05:30", "storyid": 11577935407183, "section": "Companies", "last-updated": "2020-01-02T08:59:48+05:30", "screen-name": "story"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/apple-strikes-new-deal-with-uk-chipmaker-it-sidelined-in-2017-11577935407183.html"}
