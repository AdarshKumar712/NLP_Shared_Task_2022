A list of things you made happen or things that happened to you. A list of places you went and things you did. A list of accomplishments and shortcomings.\n\nWe are by nature list-making and list-following beings. Those of us who follow political news and historical events make a list, consciously or subconsciously, of the most significant stories of the year for better or for worse. This is mine.\n\n10. The Ukrainian Debacle.\n\nIt is hard to believe that the story for which Donald J. Trump was finally impeached could fall so low on the list. Objectively, there is no doubt that Trump is guilty as charged. He brazenly solicited political assistance from a foreign leader under threat of withholding military assistance essential to that nation's survival. There is no doubt that his actions betrayed his sworn duty to uphold the national interest above his own personal benefit. There is no doubt that his treacherous dealing ran contrary to our foreign policy to the distinct advantage of Russia's Vladimir Putin.\n\nThat Trump sees nothing wrong in his actions and openly boasts that his infamous conversation with the newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was \"perfect\" is convincing evidence that our president is delusional.\n\nDoes he deserve to be impeached? Of course. For this and a dozen other reasons.\n\n9. Turkish Invasion of Northern Syria.\n\nNot everything Donald Trump does is evil though his motives may be. His sudden withdrawal of American troops from Syria left the gates open to Turkish invasion, a Kurdish genocide, and ceded foreign control of Syria to our regional adversaries.\n\nNext Page 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Bolivian Coup", "China And Hong Kong", "Climate Change", "Democratic Candidate Electability In 2020", "Hong Kong", "LGBT", "Mueller Investigation", "Mueller Report", "Notre Dame Cathedral", "Putin", "Robert Mueller", "Trump And Putin", "Turkey Attacks Syria", "Ukraine", "Vladimir Putin", "War In Ukraine"], "tags": ["Bolivian Coup", "China And Hong Kong", "LGBT", "Putin", "Robert Mueller", "Trump And Putin", "War In Ukraine", "Turkey Attacks Syria", "Climate Change", "Mueller Report", "Mueller Investigation", "Ukraine", "Hong Kong", "Notre Dame Cathedral", "Vladimir Putin", "Democratic Candidate Electability In 2020"], "authors": ["Jack Random"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Article: The Top Ten Stories of 2019 - The year is over.
