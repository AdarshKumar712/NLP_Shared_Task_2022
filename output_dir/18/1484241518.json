A few minutes later, four people where shot in a different neighborhood, three fatally. By morning, the police were investigating 10 shootings, including five deaths, across the city.\n\nAnd the year wasn\u2019t even a day old. Nor was the violence limited to St. Louis, which in 2017 had the nation\u2019s highest murder rate.\n\nIn a country that has become accustomed to gun violence in all its forms, 2020 was off to a typical start. Gunfire echoed across the country in shootings from St. Louis to Philadelphia, and from Michigan to Texas.\n\nIn Cleveland, a man who news reports said was firing off rounds to celebrate the new year accidentally killed his girlfriend. In Florida, near Orlando, two men were killed in a shooting inside a nightclub. And in Baltimore, which closed 2019 with the city\u2019s second-highest number of homicides on record, the police were investigating two killings that happened a few hours before midnight.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Tim Arango"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "It was a typical start to the new year in a country accustomed to gun violence, despite an overall drop in violent crime nationwide.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/vi-assets/static-assets/favicon-4bf96cb6a1093748bf5b3c429accb9b4.ico", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2020-01-01T23:21:49.344Z", "modified": "2020-01-01T23:21:49.344Z", "section": "U.S.", "tag": "St Louis (Mo)", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000006899850, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/a865faf9-ce57-5e9a-a5eb-98ce1a59debf", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/ca672d7b077d4f219c211b3fd4a884c3", "description": "It was a typical start to the new year in a country accustomed to gun violence, despite an overall drop in violent crime nationwide.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/us/01shootings-01alt/01shootings-01alt-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Tim Arango", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/us/01shootings-01alt/01shootings-01alt-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Murders and Homicides,New Year,Mass Shootings,St Louis", "pdate": 20200101, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/us/new-year-shootings.html", "type": "article", "title": "In a Deadly Start to 2020, Gunfire Erupts Across America", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/us/01shootings-01alt/01shootings-01alt-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Police officers at the spot where a man was shot and killed in St. Louis on Wednesday.
