He especially sought deregulation in the fields of online medical services and autonomous driving.\n\nSakurada also urged Japan to express its determination to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with its cutting-edge technologies.\n\nAkio Mimura, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said it is urgently needed to introduce digital technologies to small and midsize firms across the country to increase their productivity.\n\nTo boost the regional economy, Mimura said the chamber aims to make the most of indigenous resources and external demand including inbound travelers to promote local tourism and the tie-up among agricultural, commercial and manufacturing sectors.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 06:28:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Business leaders in Japan on Wednesday underlined their determination to further boost digital innovation this year as part of efforts for the country to lead the global economy.
