He was on an operating table at St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix as Dr. Robert Spetzler prepped for a five-hour procedure to remove a cavernous malformation on his brain stem.\n\nAt the time, Westmoreland was the No. 1 prospect in the Boston Red Sox organization and the 21st-ranked minor league player in all of baseball. But as doctors started to put the former Portsmouth High School star under anesthesia, his thoughts didn\u2019t drift toward a future career in the bigs and he wasn\u2019t dwelling on when he\u2019d get back on the field.\n\nHe was praying he\u2019d make it through alive.\n\nNearly a decade has passed since March 16, 2010 \u2014 the date of that surgery, which is emblazoned on his arm with a tattoo \u2014 and on the anniversary, Westmoreland will be back on the field as an assistant coach on Bob Prince\u2019s staff at UMass Dartmouth.\n\n\u201cIt was perfect. I had lost two of my assistant coaches to head coaching jobs, and I had been passively looking [to replace them],\u201d Prince said. \u201cThe timing couldn\u2019t have been any better. I reached out to Ryan and it went from there. We had a nice conversation in regards to the program and his role, his expectations.\u201d\n\nWestmoreland is currently working with teenage players with the Ocean State Makos, an AAU team. And, in a way, that\u2019s how he ended up with the Corsairs. He was touting some of his players to Rian McCarthy, an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator with UMass Dartmouth. McCarthy, who had previously coached the Post 18 American Legion team in Newport, asked Westmoreland if he had considered coaching at the next level.\n\n\u201cI said absolutely,\u201d Westmoreland said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t reaching out for jobs, but he asked me if I\u2019d be interested, I talked with Coach Prince and it snowballed from there. I\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nWhen Westmoreland\u2019s professional baseball career ended in 2013, he never envisioned himself as a coach. But after starting with the Portsmouth High School freshman team in 2015, then working with the Makos, he realized he could impart his vast knowledge of the game on the next generation of future stars.\n\nAnd he found it quite enjoyable.\n\n\u201cWhen I retired, I wasn\u2019t dead set on being a coach,\u201d Westmoreland said. \u201cThe first year I coached, I said to myself, \u2018I have a lot of knowledge and things I can teach.\u2019 Not only the physical, but also the mental part of the game. I can teach what I\u2019ve learned and then watch them to grow up and be successful.\u201d\n\nWestmoreland was a star at Portsmouth High School, twice named the state\u2019s Gatorade Player of the Year, before graduating in 2008. That year, he was chosen by the Red Sox in the fifth round of the MLB First-Year Player draft. A five-tool player with tremendous potential, Westmoreland by the end of his second professional season was named the club\u2019s top prospect.\n\nBut early in 2010, he felt tingling in his fingers and realized something wasn\u2019t right. Westmoreland had a cavernous malformation on his brain stem that required a dangerous surgical procedure. He attempted a comeback and was invited to Red Sox spring training in 2011, but a second surgery forced him to give up the game he loves so much at just 22 years old.\n\nThere were some dark times, but Westmoreland found solace in coaching. Now he\u2019ll take the next step in what he hopes is a lifelong endeavor. With UMass Dartmouth, Westmoreland said he won\u2019t have a defined role, but is willing to do what is asked of him.\n\n\u2033[Coach Prince] just said, \u2018We want you to be part of our program,\u2019 And that was huge for me, because I\u2019ve never coached in college,\u201d Westmoreland said. \u201cIt looks like whatever I can do to help the team, and whatever Coach Prince wants me to do, I\u2019m happy to do it.\u201d\n\nPrince knows what he\u2019s getting in Westmoreland.\n\n\u201cHe brings a lot,\u201d Prince said. \u201cJust the experience in terms of playing and the process and the grind that these kids go through. And he\u2019s been working with kids who are at a high level. He\u2019s been successful at developing players, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about \u2014 developing players and people.\u201d\n\nPrince said Westmoreland isn\u2019t hesitant to talk about what happened 10 years ago, and that most of the players already know his story. Infielder JR DiSarcina is the son of Gary DiSarcina, who was the manager of the Lowell Spinners when Westmoreland was with the club in 2009.\n\n\u201cWhen [the players] caught wind of what was going on, we were all on a group text, and one of the players said, \u2018Oh my God, I have his rookie card and he autographed it for me.\u2019 The kids know who he is,\u201d Prince said.\n\nFor Westmoreland, this coaching position could be a stepping stone.\n\n\u201cI really hope it opens that door,\u201d Westmoreland said. \u201cEver since I started coaching, I knew I wanted a future in this. I was looking to get into the college baseball world, and we\u2019ll see where it goes from there. But this is a great opportunity.\u201d\n\nAnd he has a backer in Prince.\n\n\u201cHe wants to be involved in baseball at a high level, whether it\u2019s coaching in college, professionally or scouting,\u201d Prince said. \u201cMy job, as it is with my players, is to help him get him to where he wants to go.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Scott Barrett", "Scott Barrett Daily News Staff Writer"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "This coming March, it will have been 10 years since Ryan Westmoreland experienced the scariest day of his life.
