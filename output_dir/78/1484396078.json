You get to the stage where you just want to see him arrive safely.\n\n\u201cThankfully he did and he\u2019s doing so well today.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://moosegazette.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-33-2-300x51.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://moosegazette.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/219518/northern-ireland-welcomes-first-babies-of-2020-with-little-shane-tierney-born-to-sound-of-new-year-fireworks.jpg"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "google-site-verification": "B_MASKx70RkH0rw8gFIaN0p7hefrGUrHGt09SUq9dUM", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://moosegazette.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cropped-Screenshot-32-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://moosegazette.net/northern-ireland-welcomes-first-babies-of-2020-with-little-shane-tierney-born-to-sound-of-new-year-fireworks/219518/"}
