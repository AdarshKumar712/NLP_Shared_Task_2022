The majority of UXO in Lao are cluster bombs.\n\nA cluster bomb is a small explosive submunition or bomblet that is delivered to its target in a large canister or shell.\n\nCluster bombs are indiscriminate. They cannot distinguish between civilian and military targets. Their wide-area coverage and poor targeting mechanisms nearly guarantee that unintended victims will die or be injured, even when the weapons function as designed.\n\nCluster munitions continue to kill long after a war ends because these weapons often fail to explode on impact as designed.
