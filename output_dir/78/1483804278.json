Bulgargaz and customers in Bulgaria will save by no longer having to pay for access to and transit through the territory of Romania worth an approximate 76 million leva\", the statement read.\n\nLower prices set by the Bulgartransgaz operator for gas via Strandzha adds an additional 4.6 million leva to the total savings.\n\nThe company has promised lower gas prices in the next three months and said it was in talks with Gazprom to negotiate better prices for Bulgaria. Sofia has also voiced a readiness to transit Russian gas westward to Greece and North Macedonia.\n\nTurkStream is a projected 570-mile twin pipeline to run from Russia through the Black Sea to Turkey, at which point one of the branches will continue further up to southern and southeastern Europe. The launch is scheduled for 8 January, as both branches are now filled with fuel.\n\nRussia has been supplying gas to Bulgaria since 1974 and is currently the only exporter of natural gas on the Bulgarian market. Last year, Bulgaria finished building a 7-mile segment of a pipe to link TurkStream to the so-called Balkan Stream pipeline network of Bulgaria and Serbia.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["bulgaria", "russia", "gas transit", "turkstream"], "tags": ["Russia", "TurkStream", "Bulgaria"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "ATHENS (Sputnik) - Bulgaria's Bulgargaz and Russia's Gazprom have agreed for Bulgaria to start receiving Russian gas directly from the TurkStream pipeline rather than through Romania starting 1 January to save some 81 million leva ($45 million), the Bulgarian gas company has said in a statement.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/i/sputnik.png", "meta_data": {"description": "ATHENS (Sputnik) - Bulgaria's Bulgargaz and Russia's Gazprom have agreed for Bulgaria to start receiving Russian gas directly from the TurkStream pipeline rather than through Romania starting 1 January to save some 81 million leva ($45 million), the Bulgarian gas company has said in a statement.", "keywords": "bulgaria, russia, gas transit, turkstream", "news_keywords": "bulgaria, russia, gas transit, turkstream", "robots": "all", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "ahrefs-site-verification": "ahrefs-site-verification_899ad24abeb428773ae480d902877f72151b81b12d4b7293cbfa1c452c76adcd", "analytics": {"site_domain": "sputniknews.com", "article_id": 1077913576, "p_ts": 1577863318, "rubric": "world", "tags": "bulgaria, russia, gas transit, turkstream"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SputnikInt", "url": "https://sputniknews.com/world/202001011077913576-bulgaria-starts-getting-transit-free-russian-gas-via-turkstream---bulgargaz/", "title": "Bulgaria Starts Getting Transit-Free Russian Gas Via TurkStream - Bulgargaz", "description": "ATHENS (Sputnik) - Bulgaria's Bulgargaz and Russia's Gazprom have agreed for Bulgaria to start receiving Russian gas directly from the TurkStream pipeline rather than through Romania starting 1 January to save some 81 million leva ($45 million), the Bulgarian gas company has said in a statement.", "image": "https://sputniknews.com/sharing_snippet/1077913576.png?1577863318"}, "fb": {"app_id": 799135720145118, "pages": 357990416180}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=969452947, app-argument=com.sputniknews://article?issuer_id=17&issuer_article_id=1077913576", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.sputniknews.sputnik", "og": {"title": "Bulgaria Starts Getting Transit-Free Russian Gas Via TurkStream - Bulgargaz", "url": "https://sputniknews.com/world/202001011077913576-bulgaria-starts-getting-transit-free-russian-gas-via-turkstream---bulgargaz/", "type": "website", "description": "ATHENS (Sputnik) - Bulgaria's Bulgargaz and Russia's Gazprom have agreed for Bulgaria to start receiving Russian gas directly from the TurkStream pipeline rather than through Romania starting 1 January to save some 81 million leva ($45 million), the Bulgarian gas company has said in a statement.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn2.img.sputniknews.com/images/106380/13/1063801388.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 440}}, "lastmod": "2020-01-01T11:07:35Z", "pubdate": "2020-01-01T10:21:58Z", "url_type": "usual"}, "canonical_link": "https://sputniknews.com/world/202001011077913576-bulgaria-starts-getting-transit-free-russian-gas-via-turkstream---bulgargaz/"}
