Change and growth are healthy. It just means: if you were already doing the right things in the \u201cold\u201d year\u2014wouldn\u2019t you want to keep doing them?\n\nFor me, challenge is one of my values. I want to set big goals and attempt hard things. But it\u2019s not a new value; it\u2019s one I\u2019ve had for a while. If I ever lose interest in challenging myself, I suppose that would be a new me. It\u2019s just not a version of myself I\u2019m remotely interested in.\n\nTwo years ago, I was in a dark place and feeling uncertain about a lot of things. Since then, I\u2019ve made a number of changes in my life, both large and small. Many, many times in the months that have passed, I\u2019ve looked up from whatever I\u2019ve been doing with a sense of wonder.\n\nI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here, I think. I\u2019m so glad I was willing to walk through that dark place.\n\nI kid you not, this happens to me at least several times a day. I hope it never ends.\n\nAll things considered, I was pretty happy with 2019\u2014and while I hope to continue to grow and improve, I don\u2019t need a full-on transformation this year.\n\nIf you\u2019re happy with the version of yourself you already have, maybe the question to ask at this point is: how can I be better than before?\n\nWhich is not the same as being totally different, because there\u2019s no reason to change what you\u2019ve worked so hard to achieve, accomplish, or become.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\n###\n\nImage: Erwan", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["life", "new year", "lessons", "resolutions", "Life"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Unconventional Strategies for Life, Work, and Travel", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://chrisguillebeau.com/wp-content/themes/chrisguillebeau2014/img/icons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#92dce0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://chrisguillebeau.com/wp-content/themes/chrisguillebeau2014/img/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Unconventional Strategies for Life, Work, and Travel", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin"}, "canonical_link": ""}
