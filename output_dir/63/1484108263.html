Highspot customer, it was raining hard in Seattle. I was on my way to a startup event when I answered my cell phone and our prospect said, \u201cWe\u2019re going with Highspot.\u201d Relief, then excitement, hit me harder than the downpour outside. It was a milestone moment \u2013 one that came after a long journey of establishing product-market fit, developing a sustainable competitive advantage, and iterating repeatedly based on prospect feedback. In other words, it was anything but easy.<\/p>\n<p>User-first products are driving rapid company growth in an era where individuals discover, adopt, and share software they like throughout their organizations. This is great if you\u2019re a Slack, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/shopify\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"shopify\">Shopify, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> or Dropbox, but what if your company doesn\u2019t fit that profile?<\/p>\n<p>Product-led growth is a strategy that works for the right technologies, but it\u2019s not the end-all, be-all for B2B customer acquisition. For sophisticated enterprise software platforms designed to drive company-wide value, such as <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/marketo\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"marketo\">Marketo, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/service-now-com\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"service-now-com\">ServiceNow <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Workday, that value is realized when the product is adopted en masse by one or more large segments.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re selling broad account value, rather than individual user or team value, acquisition boils down to two things: elevating account based-selling and revolutionizing the inside sales model. Done correctly, you lay a foundation capable of doubling revenue growth year-over-year, 95 percent company-wide retention, and more than 100 percent growth in new customer logos annually. Here are the steps you can take to build a model that realizes on-par results.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Work the account, not the deal<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Account-based selling is not a new concept, but the availability of data today changes the game. Advanced analytics enable teams to develop comprehensive and personalized approaches that meet modern customers\u2019 heightened expectations. And when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/form\/pdf\/state-of-the-connected-customer\/\">77 percent of business buyers<\/a> feel that technology has significantly changed how companies should interact with them, you have no choice but to deliver.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the multitude of products created to help sellers be more productive and personal, billions of cookie-cutter emails are still flooding the inboxes of a few decision makers. The market is loud. Competition is cut throat. It\u2019s no wonder 40 percent of sales reps say getting a response from a prospect is more difficult than ever before. Even pioneers of sales engagement are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yesware.com\/blog\/fixing-sales-engagement\/\">recognizing the need for evolution<\/a> \u2013 yesterday\u2019s one-size-fits-all approach to outreach only widens the gap between today\u2019s sellers and buyers.<\/p>\n<p>Companies must radically change their approach to account-based selling by building trusted relationships over time from the first-touch onward. This requires that your entire sales force \u2013 from account development representatives to your head of sales \u2013 adds tailored, tangible value at every stage of the journey. Modern buyers don\u2019t want to be sold. They want to be advised. But the majority of companies are still missing the mark, favoring spray-and-pray tactics over personalized guidance.<\/p>\n<p>One reason spamming remains prevalent, despite growing awareness of the need for quality over quantity, is that implementing a tailored approach is hard work. However, companies can make great strides by doing just three things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Invest in personalization:<\/strong> Sales reps have quota, and sales leaders carry revenue targets. The pressure is as real as the numbers. But high velocity outreach tactics simply don\u2019t work consistently. New <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20190313005156\/en\">research<\/a> from Monetate and WBR Research found that 93% of businesses with advanced personalization strategies increased their revenue last year. And while scaling personalization may sound like an oxymoron, we now have artificial intelligence (AI) technology capable of doing just that. Of course, not all AI is created equal, so take the time to discern AI-powered platforms that deliver real value from the imposters. With a little research, you\u2019ll find sales tools that discard\u00a0 rinse-and-repeat prospecting methods in favor of intelligent guidance and actionable analytics.<div

Transactions per second. Crypto-ecosystems. The decentralized web. These are the voyages of the Starship Blockchain, on it\u2019s five-year mission to seek out\u2026 OK, you get the drift! But as you can tell, there remain many, many issues to tease out of this burgeoning new tech world, one we will be unpacking at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin this December.<\/p>\n<p>There are still a lot of issues to deal with. The current version of Ethereum can only handle a dozen transactions per second. \u201cSharding\u201d or spreading the load via partitioning, should lead to a drastic increase in performance, but the question is how to do it? Ethereum 2.0 still remains a moving target. There is even a growing \u201cEthereum killer\u201d community. And while all this goes on, high-minded organizations like the Web3 Foundation are trying to foster the development of a user-friendly crypto-ecosystem and decentralized web.<\/p>\n<p>Who on earth would take all this on? <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-berlin-2019\/tickets\/?ref=speakerpost10&amp;unii-trigger-open=J7WN34\">TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin<\/a>, of course, and, in particular, our Extra Crunch stage.<\/p>\n<p>Since we launched Extra Crunch, our premium content service for those readers who like to hold TechCrunch close and cuddle it at night, we\u2019ve been running a premium EC stage at our TechCrunch Disrupt conferences, and this will be no less true in Berlin.<\/p>\n<p>Given Berlin is a hotbed of blockchain startups and development, it would be utterly remiss of us not to cover this subject, but the Extra Crunch stage gives us some extra (oh yeah!) bandwidth to do deep-dives for attendees to get under the skin of this rapidly expanding aspect of the tech industry.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re excited to be joined by three amazing speakers to pore over the latest development in the blockchain world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Justin Drake (Ethereum)<\/strong><br \/>\nJustin studied mathematics at Cambridge University. He was a Bitcoin entrepreneur from 2014 to 2017 and is now an Ethereum 2.0 researcher.<\/p>\n<p>Justin is going to cover where Ethereum 2.0 is right now as someone who has been working on sharding and scalability and supporting the Ethereum ecosystem to enable these new use cases.<\/p>\n<p>With the current version of Ethereum only able to handle a dozen transactions per second, sharding will be crucial, but Ethereum 2.0 is a moving target and remains a large-scale experiment of distributed development.<\/p>\n<p>If the community gets it right, Ethereum 2.0 could transform the Ethereum blockchain into a sort of \u201cworld computer\u201d that can execute instructions across a network of servers all around the world. On the EC stage, Justin will also be talking with other blockchain experts about building a blockchain startup. If anyone knows, he knows how important it is to build a community of developers and researchers around your blockchain project.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ash Egan (Accomplice VC)<\/strong><br \/>\nA World Economic Forum Global Shaper and advisor at ConsenSys\u2019 Tachyon Accelerator, Ash Egan has backed a number of headline companies in the space, including Bison Trails, Coda, CoinList, Dapper Labs, Near, Simplex and Torus. Before Accomplice, he co-launched ConsenSys\u2019 venture arm and started his career at Converge VC in Boston.<\/p>\n<p>Egan has previously highlighted the ongoing innovations within the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d community and how it \u201cexpands the sandbox,\u201d but he also believes that for mass adoption of crypto on social networks to take off, users will need to be monetized via advertisements and referrals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ashley Tyson (Web3 Foundation)<\/strong><br \/>\nAshley Tyson is the director of Partnerships and Strategic Initiatives at Web3 Foundation. She spends her time aligning diverse teams working on decentralized systems and supporting blockchain ecosystem initiatives like Ethereum Community Fund and ETHPrize.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to Web3 Foundation, Ashley co-founded DEFCAD, a censorship-resistant search engine for 3D printable files.

Google is also <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/meethardware\/answer\/9331064\">adding new accessibility features<\/a> to the Assistant for use during meetings.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Google yesterday <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/20\/smart-compose-is-coming-to-google-docs\/\">announced<\/a> that Smart Compose would soon come to G Suite, too.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s maybe no surprise that Google is adding its new grammar suggestions to Docs. This feature, after all, is something Google has talked about quite a bit <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/g-suite\/let-grammar-suggestions-in-google-docs-help-you-write-even-better\">in recent months<\/a>, after it first introduced it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/g-suite\/work-reimagined-new-ways-to-collaborate-safer-smarter-and-simpler-with-g-suite\/\">back in 2018<\/a>. Unlike other grammar tools, Google&#8217;s version utilizes a <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/productivity-collaboration\/using-neural-machine-translation-to-correct-grammatical-in-google-docs\">neural network approach<\/a> to detect potential grammar issues in your text, which is quite similar to the techniques used for building effective machine translation models.<\/p>\n<p>Google is also bringing to Docs the same autocorrect feature it already uses in Gmail. This tool uses Google Search to learn new words over time, but in addition, Google today announced it&#8217;s also introducing a new system for offering users more customized spelling suggestions based on your documents. That includes commonly used acronyms that may be part of a company&#8217;s internal lingo.<\/p>\n<p>The new Assistant calendaring features are now in beta and pretty self-explanatory. Indeed, it&#8217;s somewhat surprising that it took Google so long to offer these abilities. In addition to managing their calendar by voice, the company is now also making it possible to use the Assistant to send messages to meeting attendees and even join calls (&#8220;Hey Google, join my next meeting&#8221;). Surely that&#8217;s a handy feature when you&#8217;re once again running late to work and need to join an 8am call from your car while driving down the highway.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xP2KTBc1hJ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/20\/smart-compose-is-coming-to-google-docs\/\">Smart Compose is coming to Google Docs<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;Smart Compose is coming to Google Docs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/20\/smart-compose-is-coming-to-google-docs\/embed\/#?secret=xP2KTBc1hJ\" data-secret=\"xP2KTBc1hJ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google is launching a number of updates to its G Suite tools today that, among other things, brings to Google Docs an AI grammar checker, smarter spellchecking and, soon, spelling autocorrect.

important than supporting founders &#8212; especially early-stage founders. That\u2019s what our new event series, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-early-stage-sf-2020\/\">TechCrunch Early Stage<\/a>, is all about.<\/p>\n<p>These single-day events debuting next year will be highly interactive opportunities for founders to tap experts in the core startup disciplines, starting with early-stage investors (lots of investors), legal whizzes, growth gurus, product-market fit wallahs, tech stack experts, recruiting aces and much more, including workshops on pitch breakdowns.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch\u2019s goal is to provide founders with insights and new relationships on par with what an accelerator experience provides, only in a single day, and with a much greater variety of experts and investors.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-early-stage-sf-2020\/\">TC Early Stage<\/a> is an outgrowth of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/extracrunch\/\">Extra Crunch<\/a>, TechCrunch&#8217;s subscription-based editorial offering that focuses on deep analysis and advice around the big topics facing founders. In October this year at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/disrupt-sf-2019\">Disrupt SF<\/a>, we brought <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/extracrunch\/\">Extra Crunch<\/a> to life on its own stage and featured experts on dozens of topics, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to Raise My First Dollars (Russ Heddleston, DocSend, Charles Hudson, Precursor Ventures and Annie Kadavy, Redpoint Ventures)<\/li>\n<li>How to Hire at Breakneck Speed (Scott Cutler, StockX, Harjeet Taggar, TripleByte and Liz Wessel, WayUp)<\/li>\n<li>How to Evaluate Talent and Make Decisions (Ray Dalio, Bridgewater Capital)<\/li>\n<li>How to Get into Y Combinator (Michael Siebel, Y Combinator)<\/li>\n<li>How to Decide Between Bootstrapping and Raising Venture (Ben Chestnut, Mailchimp and Kathryn Petralia, Kabbage)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The sessions were mobbed. The TechCrunch team knows a winner when they see one, and the result is this new event series. The first of three TC Early Stage events next year will be in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-early-stage-sf-2020\/\">San Francisco<\/a> on April 28, with one in <strong>Paris<\/strong> on October 28 and another in <strong>New York City<\/strong> (date TBA).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-early-stage-sf-2020\/\">TC Early Stage<\/a> is designed for founders who are in their early innings, anywhere from pre-seed through Series A, when entrepreneurs need all the guidance they can get. With that in mind, the event\u2019s heart is dozens of breakout sessions run by experts and curated by TechCrunch editors. The breakouts will be long on attendee questions and conversation, and the event is structured so that attendees can easily get to six to eight different breakouts over the course of the day. In addition, TechCrunch editors will hold a handful of interviews on a main stage with notable founders and investors in time slots that will not conflict with the breakouts.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a sampling of the types of breakout sessions TechCrunch Early Stage will feature:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raising a first seed round<\/li>\n<li>Landing a Series A<\/li>\n<li>Raising early-stage investment for a SaaS company (also consumer and other major categories)<\/li>\n<li>Considering your first term sheet<\/li>\n<li>Growing users fast<\/li>\n<li>Recruiting a fabulous team<\/li>\n<li>Building a tech stack (you won\u2019t regret)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Between sessions, attendees also can meet the experts running the breakout sessions, as well as each other, via CrunchMatch, TechCrunch\u2019s event networking platform that connects like-minded attendees and arranges a meeting time and place.<\/p>\n<p>The TechCrunch team is already busy building an all-star lineup for experts for the breakout sessions and memorable interviews for the main stage. The response from the expert community around TechCrunch has been resoundingly clear. Everyone sees the need &#8212; the deeper education of early-stage founders &#8212; and they love the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-early-stage-sf-2020\/\">TC Early Stage<\/a> format &#8212; a single day, highly interactive event that brings together early-stage founders with an unprecedented collection of experts from across the startup ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-early-stage-sf-2020\/\">Tickets for the San Francisco event<\/a> are available now, so jump in and grab yours to secure your seat while they last.<\/p>\n<p>Not an early-stage founder? That\u2019s okay, too. Later-stage founders, investors or just general startup enthusiasts are welcome to attend. A <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-early-stage-sf-2020\/\">limited number of \u201cInnovator passes\u201d are available<\/a> for folks who are not early-stage founders.<\/p>\n<p>Partners are also very welcome!

href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chrjantzen\/status\/1196440361712979969\">announced \u20ac1.2 billion<\/a> in fresh funds to invest.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nordic_countries\">Nordic<\/a> entrepreneurs are a constant presence, whether they&#8217;re based in their home region, in the U.S, or the U.K. Northern Europe has deep roots in gaming, graphics, music, and communications technology that has helped raise giants like <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unity, King, Mojang, Supercell, Spotify, Skype, Rovio, Paradox Interactive, Truecaller and Kobalt. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But the ecosystem&#8217;s strength has expanded substantially outside those fields, particularly with fintech unicorns like iZettle, Klarna, and Bambora, customer service software platform Zendesk, and others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Because SLUSH, the region\u2019s largest startup conference, is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slush.org\/events\/helsinki\/#\/\">taking place in Helsinki this week<\/a>, I asked several Nordics-focused VCs to share which startup trends they&#8217;re most excited about:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Marta Sj\u00f6gren, Northzone<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fredrik Cassel, Creandum Ventures<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Neil Murray, Nordic Web Ventures<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Louise Samet, Blossom Capital<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Jimmy Fussing Nielsen, Heartcore Capital\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hjalmar Winbladh, EQT Ventures<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Lina Wenner, firstminute Capital<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tommy Andersen, byFounders<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Ari Helgason, Index Ventures<\/li>\n<li>Magda Lukaszewicz, Balderton Capital<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Christian Jantzen, Futuristic.vc<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aside from gaming, digital health and fintech were standout areas of interest. Here are their individual responses:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Marta Sj\u00f6gren (<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/northzone-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"northzone-ventures\">Northzone)<\/b><\/p> <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Healthtech: The next wave of healthtech will see the creation of some very valuable companies that are saving costs to society by rewriting the narrative of the patient experience, from diagnosis to treatment of chronic conditions, with outcomes-based data that will over time disrupt money-flows in healthcare (showing a clear ROI).\u00a0 This is a huge opportunity as the current system just does not cater to an aging population. I am especially excited to apply this thesis to mental health, diabetes, and age-related conditions.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PeopleTech (aka HRtech+productivity): I am very excited about productivity gains we will see as remote-first working environments come to market. The constant growth of project-based, gig-economy type of professional relationships will also see the rise of a productivity suite for this audience. Companion-apps for micro-entrepreneurs that cater to both private and business needs of &#8220;making it work.&#8221; Some verticalization of productivity tech [is] already starting to take place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Fredrik Cassel (<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/creandum\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"creandum\">Creandum <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Ventures)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I&#8217;m most excited about products and services whose growth is not dependent on (under)performance marketing, massive spend based on some marginally favorable CAC\/LTV comparison but ones that grow thanks to incredible user love and ambassadorship. Both with consumer users (like Depop) and with business users (like Shapr3d). Also, I&#8217;d love to meet entrepreneurs who consciously weigh their growth versus users&#8217; privacy as well as versus profitability of their present unit economics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Neil Murray (Nordic Web Ventures)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As someone who is investing first money in the Nordics, I tend to be pretty vertical agnostic and I focus heavily on founding teams instead. One trend I\u2019m particularly excited about in this regard is that we are now seeing early employees at companies like Unity, Klarna, iZettle, Spotify, Trustpilot, etc. start their own companies, providing the Nordics with a new generation of entrepreneurs who\u2019ve already been passengers on a scaling journey once and are now keen to take the wheel themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stockholm is definitely a large beneficiary of this trend as most of the biggest companies have been built there, however, it\u2019s also worth noting that companies who may not be \u201cunicorns\u201d but are still successful companies in their own right are also contributing to this, for example, I\u2019ve recently invested in a couple of companies whose founders had been executives at Trustpilot in Copenhagen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the last week, VC firms based

Highspot customer, it was raining hard in Seattle. I was on my way to a startup event when I answered my cell phone and our prospect said, \u201cWe\u2019re going with Highspot.\u201d Relief, then excitement, hit me harder than the downpour outside. It was a milestone moment \u2013 one that came after a long journey of establishing product-market fit, developing a sustainable competitive advantage, and iterating repeatedly based on prospect feedback. In other words, it was anything but easy.<\/p>\n<p>User-first products are driving rapid company growth in an era where individuals discover, adopt, and share software they like throughout their organizations. This is great if you\u2019re a Slack, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/shopify\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"shopify\">Shopify, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> or Dropbox, but what if your company doesn\u2019t fit that profile?<\/p>\n<p>Product-led growth is a strategy that works for the right technologies, but it\u2019s not the end-all, be-all for B2B customer acquisition. For sophisticated enterprise software platforms designed to drive company-wide value, such as <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/marketo\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"marketo\">Marketo, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/service-now-com\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"service-now-com\">ServiceNow <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Workday, that value is realized when the product is adopted en masse by one or more large segments.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re selling broad account value, rather than individual user or team value, acquisition boils down to two things: elevating account based-selling and revolutionizing the inside sales model. Done correctly, you lay a foundation capable of doubling revenue growth year-over-year, 95 percent company-wide retention, and more than 100 percent growth in new customer logos annually. Here are the steps you can take to build a model that realizes on-par results.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Work the account, not the deal<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Account-based selling is not a new concept, but the availability of data today changes the game. Advanced analytics enable teams to develop comprehensive and personalized approaches that meet modern customers\u2019 heightened expectations. And when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/form\/pdf\/state-of-the-connected-customer\/\">77 percent of business buyers<\/a> feel that technology has significantly changed how companies should interact with them, you have no choice but to deliver.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the multitude of products created to help sellers be more productive and personal, billions of cookie-cutter emails are still flooding the inboxes of a few decision makers. The market is loud. Competition is cut throat. It\u2019s no wonder 40 percent of sales reps say getting a response from a prospect is more difficult than ever before. Even pioneers of sales engagement are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yesware.com\/blog\/fixing-sales-engagement\/\">recognizing the need for evolution<\/a> \u2013 yesterday\u2019s one-size-fits-all approach to outreach only widens the gap between today\u2019s sellers and buyers.<\/p>\n<p>Companies must radically change their approach to account-based selling by building trusted relationships over time from the first-touch onward. This requires that your entire sales force \u2013 from account development representatives to your head of sales \u2013 adds tailored, tangible value at every stage of the journey. Modern buyers don\u2019t want to be sold. They want to be advised. But the majority of companies are still missing the mark, favoring spray-and-pray tactics over personalized guidance.<\/p>\n<p>One reason spamming remains prevalent, despite growing awareness of the need for quality over quantity, is that implementing a tailored approach is hard work. However, companies can make great strides by doing just three things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Invest in personalization:<\/strong> Sales reps have quota, and sales leaders carry revenue targets. The pressure is as real as the numbers. But high velocity outreach tactics simply don\u2019t work consistently. New <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20190313005156\/en\">research<\/a> from Monetate and WBR Research found that 93% of businesses with advanced personalization strategies increased their revenue last year. And while scaling personalization may sound like an oxymoron, we now have artificial intelligence (AI) technology capable of doing just that. Of course, not all AI is created equal, so take the time to discern AI-powered platforms that deliver real value from the imposters. With a little research, you\u2019ll find sales tools that discard\u00a0 rinse-and-repeat prospecting methods in favor of intelligent guidance and actionable analytics.<div

And yet, what about testing with communities like patients or senior citizens who may be more challenging to reach?<\/p>\n<p>It was 2:00 a.m. at the Marriott Hotel in Singapore and I just wanted to get to bed after a 16-hour flight. As co-founder of a digital health company, I was in the process of building a community of test patients. Because of security and privacy concerns, I had to approach this process unconventionally; manually recruiting prospective testers online through administered groups and forums.<\/p>\n<p>One of our test users had placed two urgent calls to me. I immediately called her back.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of our group members needs a new doctor. She is not doing well and needs a better specialist. I know you have a doctor on staff and I know it\u2019s not his job but\u2026umm, but\u2026&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I interjected immediately.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You don\u2019t need to say anything. We\u2019ll do <i>everything<\/i> we can.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Immediately, I dropped everything and called our company\u2019s Chief Medical Officer to start a referral process. For the next few days, we fired off introductions to new doctors and assisted even though these tasks were not at all related to our company\u2019s product. We were engaging with a non-conventional community which sometimes required going above and beyond the call of duty.<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, product managers have fundamentally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rainforestqa.com\/blog\/2016-08-31-what-is-usability-testing\/\">altered and automated usability testing<\/a> for new products. Employing distributed labor marketplaces like Rainforest QA, <a href=\"https:\/\/cubettech.com\/resources\/blog\/an-overview-on-usability-testing-6-tools-to-automate-it\/\">Usabilia and Juicy Studio,<\/a> growth-minded product managers have accelerated UI, UX, and backend product testing to ship faster and faster.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most important subsets of usability testing, qualitative user feedback, has also faced an onslaught of automation.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, there are numerous organizations who operate in spaces like <a href=\"https:\/\/theuxblog.com\/blog\/how-to-usability-testing-in-healthcare-setting\">healthcare<\/a>, politics, or even eldercare where obtaining qualitative feedback is not that easily automated. Often, these are fields where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcareitnews.com\/news\/patient-safety-demands-more-robust-testing-ehr-usability-says-pew\">security, privacy, and other restrictions<\/a> necessitate a manual recruiting strategy focused on partnership and community development. A good example of this is a digital health company looking to test the first iteration of its product with patients where protected health information may be shared. Yet another example is an application focused on First Amendment violations targeting journalists or other at-risk groups where identity disclosure may be prohibitive. One needs to look no further than recent news of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/behind-googles-project-nightingale-a-health-data-gold-mine-of-50-million-patients-11573571867\">Google&#8217;s Nightingale project<\/a> with Ascension Health to underscore the importance of the right policies and controls in these spaces.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve learned the lessons in this space first-hand. Over the past two years, I have built a user community of patients who suffer from cardiovascular disease. For no monetary compensation, they are testing our company\u2019s digital health application because they believe in its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beingpatient.com\/cannabis-dementia\/\">potential to make a difference<\/a> in their lives and those of others. The most remarkable and fulfilling experience of my professional career, I have learned that to test your product with non-conventional users, you have to approach the process non-conventionally as well. In the words of Y Combinator Founder Paul Graham, you are going to have to <a href=\"http:\/\/paulgraham.com\/ds.html\">\u201cdo things that don\u2019t scale\u201d<\/a> and not be afraid of digging right in.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, you have to look for and recruit users in unexpected places; some of which resist automated growth marketing efforts. Second, you need to understand the value of partnership as these groups tend to resist more transactional relationships. And finally, you need to ask for permission and be honest and forthright with your intentions as to the testing process and the eventual product that you hope will hit the market.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Recruit in unexpected places<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>If recruiting test users in a challenging space like healthcare, law and order, or even eldercare, you need to seek them out in non-traditional and unexpected places. While you may think that online discussion forums like that are centered around user testing is the first place to go, there are other channels in which you can find more engaged and eager communities.<\/p>\n<p>In medicine, <a href=\"https:\/\/ssir.org\/articles\/entry\/the_emerging_world_of_online_health_communities\">community platforms<\/a> including Patients Like Me and Care Opinion provide a key outlet to reach potential participants in a constructive and open way. In the political space, sites like <a href=\"https:\/\/borgenproject.org\/10-websites-finding-jobs-politics\/\">Democratic Gain and Hill Zoo<\/a> act similarly. Uniquely, these platforms have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2956230\/\">built-in security and approval features<\/a> that protect users\u2019 identities and allow them to only enter into conversations with their express and full consent. This is a key consideration for sensitive groups.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/06\/12\/insider\/facebook-group-new-york-times.html\">Facebook Groups<\/a> allows for even more long tail recruiting but with the obvious and attendant risks that recruiting on an open platform like Facebook carries. Due to the closed nature of the Groups product as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statnews.com\/2019\/04\/30\/facebook-new-steps-privacy-health-data\/\">many built-in security features<\/a>, Facebook Groups has escaped many of the information integrity issues and as a result, is one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobihealthnews.com\/content\/facebook-unveils-health-support-groups-new-privacy-feature-medical-topics\">healthy components of the platform<\/a>. Start by searching for a group in your space. Proceed by asking the group\u2019s administrator for permission to engage with members by explaining your purpose and focus honestly. Often, in areas like medicine or politics, group members are eager to participate in testing new products where they can offer feedback in real-time and make an impact.<\/p>\n<p>Even more fascinating is <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/quora\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"quora\">Quora <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.precisionmarketinggroup.com\/blog\/quora-for-new-users\">Quora\u2019s platform emphasizes <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/2019\/01\/quora-reddit-fuel\/\">long tail discussions<\/a> on a range of topics that even Facebook Groups cannot be narrow enough to encapsulate or cover. So, if you are looking for users with an extremely narrow focus, say those who are interested in testing a mobile app for tourism in the historic center of Hvar, Croatia, Quora may be your best opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals. Quora\u2019s discussions can go quite deep, drive substantial value, and be generative of new product features.<\/p>\n<h2><b>It\u2019s a partnership, not a transaction<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Developers and marketers have automated most user feedback and testing, but what about communities like patients or senior citizens who may be more challenging to reach?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":1914084,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"jetpack_publicize_message":"Build trust with remote users to get qualitative feedback https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/34cLNpz"},"categories":[25515,17396],"tags":[35350,1024626,79425,1309386,753,30961,66455],"crunchbase_tag":[198296169],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/GettyImages-91495797.jpg","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/34cLNpz","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.57,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"quora","cb_name":"Quora","cb_slug":"quora-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/quora"},{"slug":"paul-graham","cb_name":"Paul Graham","cb_slug":"paul-graham-person","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/paul-graham"},{"slug":"usability","cb_name":"Usability","cb_slug":"usability-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/usability"},{"slug":"y-combinator","cb_name":"Y Combinator","cb_slug":"y-combinator-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/y-combinator"}],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1839714],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1913615"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1913615"}],"version-history":[{"count":12,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1913615\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1914105,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1913615\/revisions\/1914105"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/alex-gold"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=1913615&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1914084"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1913615"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1913615"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1913615"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=1913615"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=1913615"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=1913615"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1839714,"name":"Alex Gold","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/alex-gold\/","description":"<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/_AlexGold\">Alex Gold<\/a> is co-founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myiahealth.com\/\">Myia<\/a>, an intelligent health platform employing novel biometric data to predict and prevent costly medical events.

She will get a lower response rate than you (with the CEO title), but likely a higher response rate than an outside banker who does not have an established relationship with the investor you are targeting. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also have her impersonate you via email, although there\u2019s always a risk of that ending in embarrassment if she is not highly responsible and trustworthy.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>You as the CEO should handle all the meetings. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s no need to bring your colleague who\u2019s setting up meetings, although I\u2019m sure she will appreciate it.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raising capital is a time-consuming, arduous, complex task and you will be living with the consequences of your actions for decades. I recommend hiring a professional to help you, if you can afford it. I also recommend doing thorough research before hiring a banker. The wrong decision can cost you millions of dollars, in the form of a broken deal process, a suboptimal valuation, or inappropriate investors.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good news: even if you have a small company and can\u2019t afford a banker, you can synthetically and cheaply replicate one.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":1913291,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"jetpack_publicize_message":"If you don&#8217;t have an investment banker, replicate one https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/35cgPxz by @dteten"},"categories":[25515,17396,35394854],"tags":[180368,168632,576595726,167105,95214,29172],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/GettyImages-670488186.jpg","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/35cgPxz","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.39,"tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1251731],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1912582"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1912582"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1912582\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1913300,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1912582\/revisions\/1913300"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/david-teten"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=1912582&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1913291"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1912582"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1912582"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1912582"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=1912582"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=1912582"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=1912582"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1251731,"name":"David Teten","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/david-teten\/","description":"David Teten is an advisor to emerging investment managers and a Venture Partner with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hofvc.com\/\">HOF Capital<\/a>.

Prior to founding Capital, Blair was a principal investor at Draper Fisher Jurvetson where he sourced and managed venture investments during his four-year residency.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">I\u2019ve always told<\/span> companies that investors have a much easier job than they do. To be good at their jobs, investors have to know how to do math and make decisions. As a business owner, you have to do both while also running your business.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The math piece can seem cumbersome, but it\u2019s vital for understanding whether your company is creating or destroying value. A few simple metrics can demonstrate to investors the health and viability of your company, and they can show you which levers to pull that will best optimize your company for investor interest (and secure a higher price). But before you can ever hope to communicate your business\u2019 value to an investor, you must understand it yourself.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The numbers are simple; it\u2019s the calculations that are complex<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investment math itself is not complicated. In essence, it\u2019s just about understanding whether your company is creating or destroying value by asking:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<li><strong>Where<\/strong><strong>\u00a0is your company investing its\u00a0<\/strong><strong>financial resources<\/strong><strong>?\u00a0<\/strong>Most growing companies invest heavily in sales and marketing or research and development.<\/li>\n<li><strong>What is the return on this investment?\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong>For example, how much gross profit (revenue x gross margin percentage) does a given sales and marketing investment produce?<\/li>\n<li><strong>How does that number compare to your cost of capital?\u00a0<\/strong>If it\u2019s higher, your company is creating value. If it\u2019s lower, you\u2019re destroying it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investors use this information to determine if their return would be higher than their expectation (e.g., 15% hurdle rate), should you continue down your current path of creating or destroying value. Then, they make their decision based on that calculation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A caveat I\u2019ll add here is that it\u2019s not necessarily a deal-breaker if your company is declining in value. Oil rigs, after all, are considered investment assets, even though they are perpetually declining and will eventually run out (i.e., destroy all of their value). Although this article focuses on calculations that demonstrate value creation, all investment assets can be financed at the right price.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>A deep dive into calculating value<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best metrics you can use to demonstrate value creation is your cohort-level return on investment. It\u2019s a calculation most investors are familiar with, but it may not be as straightforward to companies who don\u2019t see it as often. Again, while the metrics and concepts of investment math are simple, it\u2019s the process of getting there that requires complex analysis.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you are evaluating these metrics yourself or bringing in outside counsel to assist you, use the process below to show investors you are creating value.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Determine which information to analyze<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step in calculating value is to understand which information from your income and cash flow statements to analyze as \u201cinvestments.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by dividing your capital allocation into three main buckets: short-term investments, long-term investments and expenses. In general, short-term investments will be the ones you want to focus on, but it\u2019s helpful to walk through each.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<li><strong>Short-term investments (<\/strong><strong>pay back within<\/strong><strong> 24 months)<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Understanding whether you\u2019re creating or destroying value is the first step in communicating to investors why your company is worth their money.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":1911717,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"jetpack_publicize_message":"Know your startup&#8217;s value so you can communicate it to investors https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2r031Y9"},"categories":[25515,17396,35394854],"tags":[291,449557045,113922,28559],"crunchbase_tag":[197365513],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/GettyImages-1090770324.jpg","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2r031Y9","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.43,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"apple","cb_name":"Apple","cb_slug":"apple-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple"}],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1911703],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1911305"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1911305"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1911305\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1912559,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1911305\/revisions\/1912559"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/blair-silverberg"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=1911305&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1911717"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1911305"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1911305"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1911305"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=1911305"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=1911305"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=1911305"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1911703,"name":"Blair Silverberg","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/blair-silverberg\/","description":"Blair Silverberg is co-Founder and CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/captec.io\/\">Capital<\/a>, a financial services company using technology to accelerate the fundraising process.

Why shouldn&#8217;t office workers? That&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Sean Linehan&#8217;s vision for <a href=\"https:\/\/placement.com\/\">Placement<\/a>. The former VP of product at Flexport thinks he can consistently get people a 30% raise on their cost of living-adjusted income if they&#8217;re willing to relocate from either their sleepy hometown or an overpriced metropolis.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1914708\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Relocation.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"553\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Relocation.png 2604w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Relocation.png?resize=150,81 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Relocation.png?resize=300,162 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Relocation.png?resize=768,415 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Relocation.png?resize=680,367 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Relocation.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We think you can transform your life without becoming an engineer.

Not everyone is going to learn to code, and Placement isn&#8217;t a school. &#8220;We&#8217;re not in the business of training people to do jobs. We&#8217;re in training people to get jobs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Placement sits at the lucrative center of a slew of megatrends. People switching jobs more often. The desperate need to pay off crushing student loan debt. The rise of mid-size cities as rent gets out of control in San Francisco and New York. Social apps keeping people in touch from afar. The search for deeper fulfillment going mainstream.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1914709\" style=\"width: 440px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1914709\" class=\" wp-image-1914709\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Sean-Linehan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"430\" height=\"547\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Sean-Linehan.jpg 1064w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Sean-Linehan.jpg?resize=118,150 118w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Sean-Linehan.jpg?resize=236,300 236w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Sean-Linehan.jpg?resize=768,977 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Sean-Linehan.jpg?resize=535,680 535w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Sean-Linehan.jpg?resize=39,50 39w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1914709\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Placement co-founder and CEO Sean Linehan<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Through the normalization of income sharing agreements, Placement has found a way to powerfully monetize these societal shifts.

If I had stayed in my home town, there&#8217;s just no way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1914710\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Destinations.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"553\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Destinations.png 2604w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Destinations.png?resize=150,81 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Destinations.png?resize=300,162 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Destinations.png?resize=768,415 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Destinations.png?resize=680,367 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Destinations.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Yet after college, when friends moved away and he broke up with his girlfriend, Linehan found himself living in a bunkbed by himself with extra space. &#8220;I called a friend back home working a minimum wage job, still living at home, and said &#8216;Your life kinda sucks. Come crash with me!,&#8217; &#8221; Linehan recalls. &#8220;He was super smart &#8212; smarter than most of the people I went to Berkeley with, but he never got on the train out of town.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In the following years, Linehan coached his friend through becoming a professional and navigating interviews. &#8220;Now he&#8217;s tripled his income on a cost of living adjusted basis. He went from minimum wage to $70,000 to $80,000.&#8221; That ignited the idea for Placement. &#8220;How do you take that process of tapping people who are special and just need economic opportunity, and bring it to more people?&#8221; But Linehan needed a co-founder who could execute on getting these up-and-comers jobs.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1914712\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Logo.png 1000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Logo.png?resize=150,30 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Logo.png?resize=300,60 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Logo.png?resize=768,154 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Logo.png?resize=680,136 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Logo.png?resize=50,10 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where Katie Kent came in. Also from the product team at Flexport, Kent had helped start Zipfian Academy as the first data science bootcamp in America. The 12-week crash course had been placing 93% of graduates into full-time roles when Zipfian was acquired by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/galvanizeu\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"galvanizeu\">Galvanize, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> where Kent became director of outcomes with the mandate to get students great jobs. The right idea, experience and the track record of turning Flexport into a $3.2 billion freight forwarding unicorn led investors to jump at the chance to fund Placement.<\/p>\n<h2>Share me the money<\/h2>\n<p>So how exactly do Placement&#8217;s income sharing agreements work? &#8220;They only pay us if they make more money on a cost of living adjusted basis&#8221; Linehan explains.<\/p>\n<p>First, the startup recruits through targeted advertising and word of mouth referrals, which the company says 100% of clients have provided. Primarily, it&#8217;s seeking business professionals with a skill mismatched to their city, such as sales, human resources or operations in a place without companies competing to hire for those roles. They might have never left their hometown or returned after school at a mid-tier college, suppressing their earning potential. But lack of knowledge about jobseeking, fears of leaving their support network or a lack of funds to finance a move keep them stuck there.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignright size-full wp-image-1914714\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Search.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Search.png 1898w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Search.png?resize=150,74 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Search.png?resize=300,148 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Search.png?resize=768,378 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Search.png?resize=680,335 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Search.png?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are two moments when society puts a gentle hand on your shoulder saying its okay to move away: when you go to college and when you graduate college,&#8221; says Linehan. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to engineer a third moment. We give people the permission and space to have that conversation with their family by providing that forcing function.&#8221; Placement serves the same utility the CEO did for his friend, revealing that if they seize the opportunity of moving to a growing but still affordable city like Denver, Austin, Raleigh or Seattle, &#8220;people&#8217;s lives would be so much better.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The other demographic Placement seeks is the 10 million-plus workers who&#8217;ve gotten in over their heads in some of the country&#8217;s priciest cities. &#8220;If you&#8217;re ambitious and talented but not an engineer in SF, this is a hard life. The costs are exceeding the benefits at this point.&#8221; Placement looks for cheaper cities where their skills are still relevant and they might even earn the same or a little less, but they can fetch a huge increase in income on a cost of living-adjusted basis and they have a path to buying a house. Linehan declares that &#8220;Our controversial opinion is that more important than reskilling people is getting them to the right place where the work is happening in the first place.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignright size-full wp-image-1914718\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Interview-Prep.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"211\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Interview-Prep.png 1872w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Interview-Prep.png?resize=150,31 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Interview-Prep.png?resize=300,62 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Interview-Prep.png?resize=768,158 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Interview-Prep.png?resize=680,140 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Job-Interview-Prep.png?resize=50,10 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Placement then evaluates the prospective client in what is currently an extremely selective process to determine if they&#8217;re undervalued based on their skills, qualifications, shortfalls and redflags. If they&#8217;re already being adequately or overpaid, it won&#8217;t accept them. Those eligible are offered access to Placement&#8217;s research on all the optimal salary and location\/hirer pairs for their role, which most people wouldn&#8217;t or couldn&#8217;t do themselves. Linehan says, &#8220;We run their job search for them. We&#8217;re kind of like a concierge.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Once they&#8217;ve selected some targets, Placement quarterbacks their preparation process, helping them to improve their LinkedIn and resume, practice telling their story and offering mock interviews with experts in their field. As they progress through interviews Placement sets up and requires hirers offer remotely, it teaches clients to negotiate to get their best possible compensation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a normal person who didn&#8217;t go to an elite institution or are a couple years out of school, there&#8217;s no resources,&#8221; Linehan laments. While some top coding schools and other bootcamps place graduates, and some startups like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pathrise.com\/\">Pathrise<\/a> are also working on interview prep, most seeking a new employer end up relying on mediocre job hunting tips they find online. That&#8217;s in part because it was hard to get people to fork over significant cash in exchange for instruction that wasn&#8217;t guaranteed to help.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1914713\" style=\"width: 440px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1914713\" class=\"wp-image-1914713\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Income-Sharing-Agreement.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"430\" height=\"546\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Income-Sharing-Agreement.png 956w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Income-Sharing-Agreement.png?resize=118,150 118w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Income-Sharing-Agreement.png?resize=237,300 237w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Income-Sharing-Agreement.png?resize=768,974 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Income-Sharing-Agreement.png?resize=536,680 536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Income-Sharing-Agreement.png?resize=39,50 39w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1914713\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">How Placement income sharing agreements work<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/placement.com\/\">Placement<\/a> income sharing agreement is designed to align incentives, though. It&#8217;s vested in getting clients not only the best job and salary, but one they&#8217;ll want to stick with. As long as the startup nets them a higher adjusted income, clients pay 10% of their earnings. That lasts for 18 months, or 36 months if they receive Placement&#8217;s $5,000 relocation stipend and human support. There are also caps on the total Placement can get paid back, and the agreement dissolves after five years so clients aren&#8217;t locked in if things don&#8217;t work out.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Placement aims to help someone earning $40,000 per year pre-taxes reach $52,000 on a cost of living adjusted basis. They&#8217;d end up paying Placement $7,794 over the course of 18 months, or $433 per month. After the bill, they&#8217;d still be earning $3,900 per month, or $567 more than they used to. If they take the $5,000 relocation stipend and extra assistance, their ISA extends to 36 months and they&#8217;ll end up paying back $15,588 total, including the stipend.<\/p>\n<p>Clients are likely to keep growing their compensation after their Placement ISA ends, so they&#8217;ll start reaping all the added proceeds. The startup has worked with fewer than 1,000 clients to date, but is supposedly growing quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, Placement could move into working with programmers and designers, but it sees a big gap in assistance for business roles. Linehan notes that &#8220;We&#8217;re providing an option that will be available to a lot more people than a <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/lambda-school\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lambda-school\">Lambda School <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> or Galvanize coding bootcamp. Not everyone&#8217;s going to be software engineers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Making America anti-fragile<\/h2>\n<p>The biggest hurdle for Placement will be scaling what can be quite a hands-on, relationship-driven process of matching clients with the right hirers. &#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to get one person a job. It&#8217;s another to get 10,000 people a job,&#8221; Linehan admits. But he conquered the same problem at Flexport, which was moving 1,000 shipping containers across the ocean but had to figure out &#8220;how the hell do you move 1 million?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1914721\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1914721\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-1914721\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Founders-Katie-Kent-and-Sean-Linehan-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Founders-Katie-Kent-and-Sean-Linehan-.jpg 5472w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Founders-Katie-Kent-and-Sean-Linehan-.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Founders-Katie-Kent-and-Sean-Linehan-.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Founders-Katie-Kent-and-Sean-Linehan-.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Founders-Katie-Kent-and-Sean-Linehan-.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Placement-Founders-Katie-Kent-and-Sean-Linehan-.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1914721\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Placement co-founders (from left): Katie Kent and Sean Linehan<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>That requires Placement to pour product know-how into building tools that equip clients to take more initiative to match themselves with hirers and teach themselves interview skills. It also must automate more of its marketing outreach, client screening and connections to recruiters while retaining a human element worth a four to five-figure price.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, the startup&#8217;s team numbers just four, and though it will expand to seven soon, it may need to raise a bunch more to chase this dream. Some investors have been understandably skeptical about the whole &#8220;handing out $5,000&#8221; model without onerous ISAs.<\/p>\n<p>For comparison, the one-year MissionU school for business and data jobs that was acquired and shut down by WeWork asked for 15% of income for three years without a relocation stipend, or $23,400 on a $52,000 per year job. ISAs for General Assembly&#8217;s tech job education cost 10% for 48 months, even if students don&#8217;t earn more than in their old job. Pathrise&#8217;s slimmer offering costs just 7% for one year. Colleges are jumping on the trend too, with some working with startup Leif to run their ISAs.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/Poyrlb586p\">https:\/\/t.co\/Poyrlb586p<\/a> customer just got 4 job offers!<\/p>\n<p>He accepted a 319% raise.<\/p>\n<p>So excited for him \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Katie Kent (@k80kent) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/k80kent\/status\/1190078065751154689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 1, 2019<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Placement has plans to cover prickly edge cases. If someone gets laid off from their new job, the startup will help them find another. &#8220;We&#8217;re on the hook to make sure they&#8217;re successful,&#8221; Linehan insists. It only won&#8217;t step in if an employee is fired for an ethical problem like sexual harassment or committing fraud. And if someone simply gets lonely in their unfamiliar city, they&#8217;re not required to stay, though moving home could hurt their earnings and Placement&#8217;s take. That&#8217;s why the startup is working to help its clients find community, even amongst each other, so they don&#8217;t feel isolated, and prefers sending workers to cities where they know someone.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Placement must resist the temptation to become a hiring agency paid by employers and instead work fully on behalf of its clients. &#8220;When you&#8217;re aligned economically with the employer, you&#8217;re just chasing dollars from bigger and bigger whales of companies, and at one point you figure out you&#8217;re a recruiting firm for the Gap,&#8221; Linehan says with a shudder. The complexity of dealing with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service is enough hassle, so Placement doesn&#8217;t intend to work with jobseekers abroad or those that need visas, as &#8220;it&#8217;s not good for startups if you&#8217;re at the mercy of the government.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1914731 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/gettyimages-610949074-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"583\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/gettyimages-610949074-1.jpg 583w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/gettyimages-610949074-1.jpg?resize=127,150 127w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/gettyimages-610949074-1.jpg?resize=255,300 255w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/gettyimages-610949074-1.jpg?resize=578,680 578w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/gettyimages-610949074-1.jpg?resize=42,50 42w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Luckily, U.S. salaries total $8.6 trillion per year, Linehan claims, so it&#8217;s got enough of a domestic market. &#8220;The American economy is so huge that I don&#8217;t see other people tackling problems like that being competitive.&#8221; Placement does have potential to use its data to recommend and teach specific skills. &#8220;If you just make this change, if you learn Excel, you could totally get this job in a different industry that pays more and that you&#8217;ll like more,&#8221; Linehan says.

You just need people that care about getting on the right track, and that to me is a worthy cause to dedicate a life to.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re giving away money to strangers on the internet&#8221; is a pretty cavalier pitch for a new startup.

Manfra, senior DHS cybersecurity official, to leave government"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Jeanette Manfra, one<\/span> of the most senior and experienced U.S. cybersecurity officials, is leaving government after more than a decade in the public sector.<\/p>\n<p>Manfra, who served as assistant director for cybersecurity at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), will join the private sector in the New Year. CISA is Homeland Security&#8217;s dedicated civilian cybersecurity unit set up a year ago to respond to help protect against threats to U.S. critical infrastructure and foreign threats.<\/p>\n<p>In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Manfra said it was a &#8220;really hard time to leave,&#8221; but the move will give her successor time to transition into the role ahead of the upcoming 2020 presidential election.<\/p>\n<p>She did not say what her new job will be, only that she will take time off to be with her family in the meantime. She will leave her post at the end of the year.<\/p>\n<p>Cyberscoop first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cyberscoop.com\/jeanette-manfra-dhs-resigning\/\">reported<\/a> her pending departure, citing sources.<\/p>\n<p>Manfra&#8217;s departure from government will be seen as largely unexpected. At Homeland Security, she has served three presidents and worked on numerous projects to improve relations with the private sector, which are considered crucial partners in defending U.S. cyberspace. She also saw the agency double down on election security, threats to the supply chain, and efforts to protect U.S. critical infrastructure like the power grid and water networks from nefarious attempts by nation states.<\/p>\n<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt SF this year, Manfra also talked candidly about the ongoing threats to U.S. cybersecurity, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/03\/lack-cybersecurity-professionals-threat-dhs\/\">a skills shortage<\/a> and the risks posed by <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/06\/government-prevent-wannacry-style-dhs\/\">another global &#8220;WannaCry-style&#8221; cyberattack<\/a>, which in 2017 saw thousands of computers infected by file-locking malware, causing billions of dollars worth of damage.<\/p>\n<p>Manfra joined Homeland Security in 2007 under then-president George W. Bush, half a decade after the department was founded in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Manfra described the early years as a time when there weren&#8217;t &#8220;a lot of people talking about cybersecurity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It definitely was not really on the national stage at the time. It was, you know, there was still a lot of debate as to whether &#8216;cybersecurity&#8217; was one word or two words,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>But in the years past and as internet access and tech companies continued to grow, she said the U.S. saw several &#8220;wake up&#8221; calls that brought cybersecurity into the public mainstream. The hack of Sony Pictures in 2016 and the WannaCry global ransomware attack in 2017 were two, and both <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/06\/us-treasury-sanctions-north-korean-hackers-over-sony-hack-wannacry-attack\/\">were blamed<\/a> on North Korea. Another, she said, was the 2015 data breach of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which saw suspected Chinese hackers <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/06\/17\/us-government-begins-outreach-to-office-of-personnel-management-hack-victims\/\">steal more than 21 million sensitive background check files<\/a> of government employees who had sought security clearance.<\/p>\n<p>The department&#8217;s cybersecurity presence started out as a &#8220;very small, frankly relatively unknown group of people,&#8221; she said. A decade later it had become a major force in managing crises like the OPM attack, a breach that she said helped to push government to better prioritize cybersecurity.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[The OPM breach] forced us to make some changes across the government that&#8217;ve been good,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>In the aftermath, the government took steps to bolster its own systems and networks to lower its attack surface by removing Kaspersky from its networks <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/09\/13\/kaspersky-executive-branch-ban-dhs-homeland-security\/\">citing fears<\/a> about Russian intelligence, and taking the lead rolling out HTTPS website encryption and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/16\/cia-nsa-defense-dept-dmarc-email-security\/\">email security protections<\/a> across the federal domains \u2014 an effort still to this day <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/01\/half-fortune-500-dmarc-email-security\/\">largely neglected<\/a> by some of the world&#8217;s wealthiest companies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ktArfC0p2po?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p><!-- TAG START --><\/p>\n<p>Election security, she said, was another major wake-up call for the government. Russia waged a widescale disinformation \u2014 or &#8220;fake news&#8221; \u2014 campaign during the 2016 election to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/08\/senate-report-says-russian-election-interference-invariably-supported-trump-recommends-national-psa\/\">sow discord and exploit divisions<\/a> in communities across the U.S. But there were also fears that hackers could break in and modify the tallies in voting machines, a concern that never came to fruition but one that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/27\/senators-security-voting-machines\/\">security experts<\/a> say remains a threat. Lawmakers have been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/09\/voting-machine-maker-election-security\/\">pushing for the removal<\/a> of paperless and electronic-only voting machines to reduce the risk of hackers manipulate the votes in favor of a particular candidate.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In 2016, it was our best judgment that the Russians were looking to undermine confidence,&#8221; Manfra told TechCrunch. &#8220;The public confidence is important, and we need to be thinking within the government about the adversaries&#8217; ability and willingness to use those against us,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Manfra said the department knew it had to work closer with state and local election boards to figure out their needs following the 2016 election. &#8220;We had a lot of honest conversations with [election boards] about what they need, what do we do, and how can we help,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the fastest I&#8217;ve ever seen a sector come together.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Those partnerships with local elections have given Homeland Security unprecedented visibility into the nation&#8217;s election infrastructure, she said, going from &#8220;some coverage&#8221; in 2016 to near-absolute insight across the country.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If we ever did again get technical indicators that an adversary was trying to do something, we would be able to move more quickly and much more expansively across the country,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>That effort paid off. Last year&#8217;s midterm election was remarkably quiet compared to 2016. Both the Justice Department and Homeland Security said <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/05\/no-evidence-vote-hacking-election\/\">there was &#8220;no evidence&#8221; to support<\/a> foreign interference during the midterms.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s that running theme of public-private collaboration that Manfra looked back on with pride. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have all the answers and we can&#8217;t do it alone.&#8221; Those partnerships across the industry verticals \u2014 from elections to finance, energy and manufacturing \u2014 are &#8220;crucial to everything that we do,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really easy to say how important it is to have the government in the private sector working together,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But to do it well, it&#8217;s actually really hard.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Manfra said the government had to be &#8220;willing to open itself&#8221; to build trust with its partners. &#8220;We now have some of the largest companies in the country that we built trusted relationships when they know that they can give us sensitive information \u2014 and we can take that and use it to protect other people, but we&#8217;re not going to abuse that trust,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of her time at Homeland Security, Manfra said she was most proud of her team. &#8220;A lot of them have been with me since we started,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They could be working out in the private sector making a ton of money, but they&#8217;re dedicating their lives here,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>But she said she was &#8220;forcing&#8221; herself to have no regrets during her time in government.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet known who will replace Manfra or will take on her responsibilities. But her advice for her eventual successor: &#8220;Trust your team, trust your partners, and stay focused,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a broad mission. It&#8217;s easy to lose focus.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related stories:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/video\/state-of-the-security-union-with-jeanette-manfra-dhs\/\">State of the Security Union with Jeanette Manfra (video)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/06\/government-prevent-wannacry-style-dhs\/\">No one could prevent another \u2018WannaCry-style\u2019 attack, says DHS official<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/03\/lack-cybersecurity-professionals-threat-dhs\/\">The lack of cybersecurity talent is \u2018a national security threat,\u2019 says DHS official<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/09\/cisa-subpoena-powers-isp-vulnerable-systems\/\">DHS cyber unit wants to subpoena ISPs to identify vulnerable systems<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/17\/cisa-bluekeep-working-exploit\/\">Homeland Security has tested a working BlueKeep remote code execution exploit<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/09\/trump-shutdown-harming-cyber-national-security\/\">How Trump\u2019s government shutdown is harming cyber and national security<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jeanette Manfra, one of the most senior and experienced U.S. cybersecurity officials, is leaving government after more than a decade in the public sector.

make to update their IT systems to get more out of them and reduce costs &#8212; and today one of the bigger startups that&#8217;s built a platform to help get the ball rolling is announcing a huge round of funding.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/celonis.com\">Celonis<\/a>, a leader in the area of process mining &#8212; which tracks data produced by a company&#8217;s software, as well as how the software works, in order to provide guidance on what a company could and should do to improve it &#8212; has raised $290 million in a Series C round of funding, giving the startup a post-money

href=\"https:\/\/www.colliers.com\/en-gb\/munich\/insights\/research-munich-economic-facts\">industrial and economic center<\/a> in Germany that you could say is a veritable petri dish when it comes to large business in need of digital transformation &#8212; and has been cash-flow positive from the start.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">In fact, Celonis waited until it was nearly six years old to take its first outside funding (prior to this Series C it had picked up less than $80 million, see <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size:

style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The size and timing of this latest equity injection is due to seizing the moment, and tapping networks of people to do so. It has already been growing at a triple-digit rate, with customers like Siemens, Cisco, L&#8217;Oreal, Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone among them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our tech has become its own category with a lot of successful customers,&#8221; <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Bastian Nominacher, the co-CEO who co-founded the company with Alexander Rinke and Martin Klenk, said in an interview<\/span>. &#8220;It&#8217;s a key driver for sustainable business operations, and we felt that we needed to have the right network of people to keep momentum in this market.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To that end, this latest round&#8217;s participants lines up with the company&#8217;s strategic goals. It is being led by Arena Holdings &#8212; an investment firm led by Feroz Dewan &#8212; with Ryan Smith, co-founder and CEO of Qualtrics; and Tooey Courtemanche, founder and CEO of Procore, also included, alongside previous investors 83North and Accel.<\/p>\n<p>Celonis said Smith will be a special advisor, working alongside another strategic board member, Hybris founder Carsten Thoma. Dewan, meanwhile, used to run hedge funds for Tiger Global (among other roles) and currently sits on the <a href=\"http:\/\/ir.kraftheinzcompany.com\/board-directors\/feroz-dewan\">board of directors of Kraft Heinz<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCelonis is the clear market leader in a category with open-ended potential. It has demonstrated an enviable record of growth and value creation for its customers and partners,\u201d said Dewan in a statement. \u201cCelonis helps companies capitalise on two inexorable trends that cut across geography and industry: the use of data to enable faster, better decision-making and the desire for all businesses to operate at their full potential.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The core of Celonis&#8217; offering is to provide process mining around an organizations&#8217; IT systems. Nominacher said that this could include anything from 5 to over 100 different pieces of software, with the main idea being that Celonis&#8217;s platform monitors a company&#8217;s whole solar system of apps, so to speak, in order to produce its insights &#8212; providing and &#8220;X-ray&#8221; view of the situation, in the words of Rinke.<\/p>\n<p>Those insights, in turn, are used either by the company itself, or by consultants engaged by the organization, to make further suggestions, whether that&#8217;s to implement something like robotic process automation (RPA) to speed up a specific process, or use a different piece of software to crunch data better, or reconfigure how staff is deployed, and so on. This is not a one-off thing: the idea is continuous monitoring to pick up new patterns or problems.<\/p>\n<p>In recent times, the company has started to expand the system into a wider set of use cases, by providing tools to monitor operations and customer experience, and to apply its process mining engine to a wider set of company sizes beyond large enterprises, and by bringing in more AI to its basic techniques.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, Nominacher said that there are currently no plans to, say, extend into RPA or other &#8220;fixing&#8221; tools itself, pointing to a kind of laser strategy that is likely part of what has helped it grow so well up to now.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to focus on the relevant parts of what you provide,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We one layer, one that can give the right guidance.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>More than $1 trillion is spent by enterprises annually on &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; &#8212; the investments that organizations make to update their IT systems to get more out of them and reduce costs &#8212; and today one of the bigger startups that&#8217;s built a platform to help get the ball rolling is announcing a huge round [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13119829,"featured_media":1860106,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"jetpack_publicize_message":""},"categories":[449557044,449557100,576602979,20429,17396],"tags":[],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/GettyImages-1042687648.jpg","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2QOZib9","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[13119829],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1914950"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1914950"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1914950\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1914973,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1914950\/revisions\/1914973"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/13119829"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=1914950&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/13119829"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1860106"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1914950"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1914950"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1914950"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=1914950"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=1914950"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=1914950"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":13119829,"name":"Ingrid Lunden","url":"","description":"","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/ingrid-lunden\/","slug":"ingrid-lunden","avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6648ec93043f0f368091adece63c6d52?s=24&d=identicon&r=g","48":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6648ec93043f0f368091adece63c6d52?s=48&d=identicon&r=g","96":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6648ec93043f0f368091adece63c6d52?s=96&d=identicon&r=g"},"links":{"facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ingridlunden","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ingridlunden","linkedin":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ingridlunden","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/ingrid-lunden"},"position":"Writer","cbDescription":"<p>Ingrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before TechCrunch, Ingrid worked at paidContent.org, where she was a staff writer, and has in the past also written freelance regularly for other publications such as the Financial Times.

Customers get the option to add it from partnered merchants, file claims for lost \/ damaged \/ stolen packages in one tap, and get reimbursement from respected Lloyd&#8217;s Of London.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1914848\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Route-Package-Tracking-App.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1099\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Route-Package-Tracking-App.png 3540w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Route-Package-Tracking-App.png?resize=140,150 140w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Route-Package-Tracking-App.png?resize=280,300 280w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Route-Package-Tracking-App.png?resize=768,824 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Route-Package-Tracking-App.png?resize=634,680 634w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Route-Package-Tracking-App.png?resize=47,50 47w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Walker claims that merchants that offer Route+ (which is free for them) &#8220;have seen an increase in conversion, decreased spend on customer support teams, and an improved post-purchase customer experience due to <span class=\"il\">Route<\/span>\u2019s ability to quickly handle customer claims.&#8221; Merchants can also opt to pay themselves for Route+ on every order<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Route now works with 1600 merchants and 600 carriers and has overseen shipments to 1.3 million customers in 187 countries. John Mayfield from Peak Venture Capital says &#8220;Their phenomenal growth of acquiring over 600 clients in the first three months makes them one of the fastest growing companies we have ever seen.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Brown Box Wars<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The biggest challenge for Route is overcoming the thick, thick crowd of competitors in the market. Rakuten&#8217;s Slice can pull orders from your email and also grabs you refunds if an item goes on sale after you buy it. 17Track lets you paste in big lists of tracking numbers in case they&#8217;re registered to someone else&#8217;s email. Parcel offers a barcode scanner. &#8216;Deliveries&#8217; will set up calendar appointments for arrivals, and works on Mac and Apple Watch. ParcelTrack lets you forward it emails of purchases to monitor, and a $2.99 premium version offers live locations of your packages plus customizable push notifications.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"vertical  wp-image-1914849 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Best-Package-Tracking-APp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"430\" height=\"794\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Best-Package-Tracking-APp.png 546w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Best-Package-Tracking-APp.png?resize=81,150 81w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Best-Package-Tracking-APp.png?resize=163,300 163w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Best-Package-Tracking-APp.png?resize=368,680 368w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Best-Package-Tracking-APp.png?resize=27,50 27w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" \/>Route&#8217;s strength is that it&#8217;s totally free for consumers unless they want to buy insurance, and does email tracking automatically, though it will lack manual tracking number input for a few more weeks. It&#8217;s managed a 90 percent customer satisfaction score. Still, the startup could be vulnerable to a major player in ecommerce like Amazon or Shopify barging into the space. There are also platform risks, such as if Gmail blocked its scanning for tracking numbers, though Google is currently partnered with Route to facilitate email scanning.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;The better that Amazon gets at providing similar services, the more other merchants need those tools in order to compete outside of Amazon&#8221; says Walker. &#8220;From the insurance side, we are pretty good at detecting risk before it becomes a major issue and we are insuring on an individual order basis so catastrophic incidences are minimized.&#8221; The company also has to keep a watchful eye out for fraudulent insurance claims.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The growing megatrend of purchase behavior shifting online means the once occasional activity of receiving a package has become a constant chore in need of streamlining. Plenty of merchants are meanwhile looking to offload the complexity of keeping impatient buyers happy. If Route conquers its first market, it could move into adjacent spaces ranging from merchant services like freight forwarding and financing to consumer features like physical mail scanning for electronic delivery.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;Ecommerce is in my blood. I feel like I\u2019ve taken 25 years of experience and started to craft a really interesting product in this space&#8221; Walker concludes. &#8220;With commerce going more digital everyday, there is an opportunity to create a big dent.&#8221; Or in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.routeapp.io\/\">Route<\/a>&#8216;s case, an opportunity to insure your packages against big dents.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Between Amazon, FedEx, UPS, and indie merchants, it&#8217;s easy to lose track of when your online purchases will be delivered.

href=\"https:\/\/www.wonderbly.com\/\">Wonderbly<\/a>, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/07\/31\/wonderbly\/\">personalised book publisher<\/a> backed by <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/06\/25\/lost-my-name\/\">Google Ventures<\/a> and best known for the breakout hit &#8220;Lost My Name,&#8221; is unveiling <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wonderblystudios.com\/\">Wonderbly Studios<\/a> in a bid to make it easier for other brands to offer personalised and bespoke printed books on-demand.<\/p>\n<p>Initially, Wonderfully Studios will work with select partners to provide access to its personalisation API and help create new books using its technology and expertise in the space. However, longer term Wonderbly co-founder and CEO Asi Sharabi tells me the plan is to continue developing the platform and eventually open up the whole thing so that anybody can offer high-quality and data-infused personalised books via its API.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Selling high quality personalised products &#8211; products that extend beyond the trivial &#8220;put my name on a mug&#8221; &#8211; is no easy task,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Meaningfully personalised products and businesses are still quite complex to operate at scale. You need a rendering stack, integration with a local print house, couriers, customer support and more. These technical and operational hurdles are a barrier to entry&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Sharabi adds that although Wonderbly is aware of some &#8220;cool&#8221; personalised book ideas already on the market, he says that very few are reaching meaningful scale. &#8220;We hope to change all that with our personalisation platform and provide a fast, seamless experience with responsive previews and high fidelity physical products for multiple and complex personalisation logics,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>The first project to come out of Wonderbly Studios is an interactive journal from Wizarding World (the Official Harry Potter Fan Club), which is a joint venture between Pottermore Ltd. and Warner Bros.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Keys and Curios&#8221; journal is described as full of interactive surprises and secrets that can be unlocked using the Wizarding World app. It incorporates a fan\u2019s name, house traits and more to take them on a unique journey through the wizarding year.<\/p>\n<p>The books contents were written and designed by the Wizarding World Digital team, and feature images from across the Wizarding World, artwork by illustrator Jim Kay and specially designed Hogwarts house covers by MinaLima (the graphic designer design team behind some of the visuals from the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films).<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the personalisation technology, e-commerce integration and on-demand printing\/logistics is powered by Wonderbly.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The end customers interact via the partner&#8217;s e-commerce stack,&#8221; explains Sharabi. These stacks (e.g Shopify or Magento) were not built for personalised products and customisation. Adding this functionality is hard &#8211; we know, we&#8217;ve been doing it for 5 years. This is why we developed the Wonderbly Personalisation API&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Products created on the Wonderbly platform can deliver &#8220;limitless amount of creativity, constrained only by imagination,&#8221; says the Wonderbly CEO. That&#8217;s because Wonderbly takes cares of a lot of the remaining heavy-lifting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Products are rendered in real-time at scale for customers as part of the shopping experience,&#8221; explains Sharabi. &#8220;The platform handles the complexities of integrating with e-commerce systems in a developer friendly way, making it a simple task to add a personalised product to a cart. When an order is completed a simple web hook ensures that the products are rendered, printed and shipped to the customer, while feeding into our partner\u2019s systems for progress notification and customer support&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>With regards to what kind of personalised books we might see come to market as Wonderbly Studios opens up further, it is likely impossible to predict. That&#8217;s because the full range of potential experiences is likely something that no single person or team could ever imagine, which, of course is the whole point.<\/p>\n<p>As Sharabi previously told TechCrunch, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/06\/01\/scaling-creativity\/\">you can&#8217;t scale creativity<\/a> in the same way as tech &#8211; you have to allow creativity to come from anywhere.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What if you can create a customised art, poetry or recipes book at the same ease you make a Spotify playlist?&#8221; he asks rhetorically. &#8220;What would gaming printed yearbooks look like? What if travel guides and language acquisition become more personalised? What if you can order an &#8216;I was there&#8217; personalised keepsake for live gigs and festivals? These and more are questions that get us very excited&#8221;.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wonderbly, the personalised book publisher backed by Google Ventures and best known for the breakout hit &#8220;Lost My Name,&#8221; is unveiling Wonderbly Studios in a bid to make it easier for other brands to offer personalised and bespoke printed books on-demand.

giants&#8221; Facebook and Google in a new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amnesty.org\/en\/documents\/pol30\/1404\/2019\/en\/\">report<\/a> which warns the pair&#8217;s market dominating platforms are

Facebook\u2019s platforms come at a systemic cost,&#8221; Amnesty warns. &#8220;The companies\u2019 surveillance-based business model forces people to make a Faustian bargain, whereby they are only able to enjoy their human rights online by submitting to a system predicated on human rights abuse. Firstly, an assault on the right to privacy on an unprecedented scale, and then a series of knock-on effects that pose a serious risk to a range of other rights, from freedom of expression and opinion, to freedom of thought and the right to non-discrimination.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This isn\u2019t the internet people signed up for,&#8221; it adds.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s most striking about the report is the familiarly of the arguments. There is now a huge weight of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/19\/a-10-point-plan-to-reboot-the-data-industrial-complex-for-the-common-good\/\">consensus criticism<\/a> around surveillance-based decision-making &#8212; from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/24\/apples-tim-cook-makes-blistering-attack-on-the-data-industrial-complex\/\">Apple&#8217;s own Tim Cook<\/a> through scholars such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2019\/oct\/04\/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy\">Shoshana Zuboff<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/zeynep\/status\/857269154822443009?lang=en\">Zeynep Tufekci<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/16\/un-warns-over-human-rights-impact-of-a-digital-welfare-state\/\">the United Nations<\/a> &#8212; that&#8217;s itself been fed by a steady stream of reportage of the individual and societal harms flowing from platforms&#8217; pervasive and consentless capturing and hijacking of people&#8217;s information for ad-based manipulation and profit.<\/p>\n<p>This core power asymmetry is maintained and topped off by self-serving policy positions which at best fiddle around the edges of an inherently anti-humanitarian system. While platforms have become practiced in<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/15\/facebook-under-pressure-over-soros-smear-tactics\/\"> dark arts PR<\/a> &#8212; offering, at best, a pantomime ear to the latest data-enabled outrage that&#8217;s making headlines, without ever actually changing the underlying system. That surveillance capitalism&#8217;s abusive <em>modus operandi<\/em> is now inspiring governments to follow suit &#8212; aping the approach by developing their own data-driven <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/28\/china-social-credit\/\">control systems<\/a> to straitjacket citizens &#8212; is exceptionally chilling.<\/p>\n<p>But while the arguments against digital surveillance are now very familiar what&#8217;s still sorely lacking is an effective regulatory response to force reform of what is at base a moral failure &#8212; and one that&#8217;s been allowed to scale so big it&#8217;s attacking the democratic underpinnings of Western society.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Google and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> have established policies and processes to address their impacts on privacy and freedom of expression \u2013 but evidently, given that their surveillance-based business model undermines the very essence of the right to privacy and poses a serious risk to a range of other rights, the companies are not taking a holistic approach, nor are they questioning whether their current business models themselves can be compliant with their responsibility to respect human rights,&#8221; Amnesty writes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The abuse of privacy that is core to Facebook and Google\u2019s surveillance-based business model is starkly demonstrated by the companies\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/10\/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony\/\">long history of privacy scandals<\/a>. Despite the companies\u2019 assurances over their commitment to privacy, it is difficult not to see these numerous privacy infringements as part of the normal functioning of their business, rather than aberrations.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Needless to say Facebook and Google do not agree with Amnesty&#8217;s assessment. But, well, they would say that wouldn&#8217;t they?<\/p>\n<p>Amnesty&#8217;s report notes there is now a whole surveillance industry feeding this beast &#8212; from adtech players to data brokers &#8212; while pointing out that the dominance of Facebook and Google, aka the adtech duopoly, over &#8220;the primary channels that most of the world relies on to engage with the internet&#8221; is itself another harm, as it lends the pair of surveillance giants &#8220;unparalleled power over people&#8217;s lives online&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The power of Google and Facebook over the core platforms of the internet poses unique risks for human rights,&#8221; it warns. &#8220;For most people it is simply not feasible to use the internet while avoiding all Google and Facebook services. The dominant internet platforms are no longer \u2018optional\u2019 in many societies, and using them is a necessary part of participating in modern life.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Amnesty concludes that it is &#8220;now evident that the era of self-regulation in the tech sector is coming to an end&#8221; &#8212; saying further state-based regulation will be necessary. Its call there is for legislators to follow a human rights-based approach to rein in surveillance giants.<\/p>\n<p>You can read the report in full <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amnesty.org\/download\/Documents\/POL3014042019ENGLISH.PDF\">here<\/a> (PDF).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Human rights charity Amnesty International is the latest to call for reform of surveillance capitalism &#8212;

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is launching a number of updates to its G Suite tools today that, among other things, brings to Google Docs an AI grammar checker, smarter spellchecking and, soon, spelling autocorrect. The company is also launching the ability for G Suite users to use the Google Assistant to read out a calendar schedule and, maybe even more importantly, create, cancel and reschedule events. Google is also <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/meethardware\/answer\/9331064\">adding new accessibility features<\/a> to the Assistant for use during meetings.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Google yesterday <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/20\/smart-compose-is-coming-to-google-docs\/\">announced<\/a> that Smart Compose would soon come to G Suite, too.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s maybe no surprise that Google is adding its new grammar suggestions to Docs. This feature, after all, is something Google has talked about quite a bit <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/g-suite\/let-grammar-suggestions-in-google-docs-help-you-write-even-better\">in recent months<\/a>, after it first introduced it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/g-suite\/work-reimagined-new-ways-to-collaborate-safer-smarter-and-simpler-with-g-suite\/\">back in 2018<\/a>. Unlike other grammar tools, Google&#8217;s version utilizes a <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/productivity-collaboration\/using-neural-machine-translation-to-correct-grammatical-in-google-docs\">neural network approach<\/a> to detect potential grammar issues in your text, which is quite similar to the techniques used for building effective machine translation models.<\/p>\n<p>Google is also bringing to Docs the same autocorrect feature it already uses in Gmail. This tool uses Google Search to learn new words over time, but in addition, Google today announced it&#8217;s also introducing a new system for offering users more customized spelling suggestions based on your documents. That includes commonly used acronyms that may be part of a company&#8217;s internal lingo.<\/p>\n<p>The new Assistant calendaring features are now in beta and pretty self-explanatory. Indeed, it&#8217;s somewhat surprising that it took Google so long to offer these abilities. In addition to managing their calendar by voice, the company is now also making it possible to use the Assistant to send messages to meeting attendees and even join calls (&#8220;Hey Google, join my next meeting&#8221;).

a seemingly endless string of coveted deals for his bank, Morgan Stanley. In more recent years, it has served as the lead underwriter for Facebook, Uber, Spotify and Slack. Grimes, who has been a banker for 32 years &#8212; 25 of them at <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/morgan-stanley\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"morgan-stanley\">Morgan Stanley <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> &#8212;\u00a0 has also played a role in the IPOs of Google, Salesforce, LinkedIn, Workday and hundreds of other companies.<\/p>\n<p>Because some of these offerings have gone better than others, Morgan Stanley and other investment banks are now being asked by buzzy startups and their investors to embrace more direct listings, a maneuver pioneered by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/spotify\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"spotify\">Spotify <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and copied by Slack wherein rather than sell a percentage of shares to the public in a fundraising event, companies are essentially moving all their stock from the private markets to public ones in one fell swoop.<\/p>\n<p>They cost the companies less money in banking fees. They also immediately free everyone on a company&#8217;s cap table to share their shares if they so choose, which has made the concept especially popular with VCs like BIll Gurley and Michael Moritz &#8212; though investors also cite the money that companies have been leaving on the table with traditional IPOs. Gurley specifically has talked publicly about underpriced offerings costing newly public outfits <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/09\/12\/bill-gurley-says-ipos-put-silicon-valley-on-bad-end-of-a-bad-joke.html\">$170 billion over the last 30 years<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Grimes, in a rare public appearance last week at a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.strictlyvc.com\/\">StrictlyVC<\/a> event, said he supports direct listings completely, calling the &#8220;pricing mechanism&#8221; more efficient, &#8220;absolutely.&#8221; He has reason to be a proponent of this new &#8220;product.&#8221; Both Spotify and Slack turned to Morgan Stanley to organize their direct listings &#8212; a process that involves running simultaneous auctions to determine the price at which demand and supply meet &#8212; and to ensure there would be enough liquidity for the listings to go smoothly.<\/p>\n<p>Given the success of both, the bank is now better positioned than any to continue orchestrating direct listings for potential issuers, including, reportedly, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/airbnb\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"airbnb\">Airbnb <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and DoorDash. (Grimes wouldn&#8217;t confirm the plans of any companies with which Morgan Stanley plans to work.)<\/p>\n<p>Still, during last week&#8217;s sit-down, we wanted to know more about how they work and whether there&#8217;s a chance that banks will eventually try to thwart the process, given that they require just as much work, are potentially less lucrative, and keep banks from rewarding some of their best customers &#8212; meaning the institutions that are accustomed to being funneled IPO shares ahead of retail investors in traditional offerings.<\/p>\n<p>Grimes patiently sat through roughly 40 minutes of questions, all of which you can read tomorrow if you&#8217;re a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/\">subscriber of Extra Crunch<\/a>, where much more of the transcript is being published. In the meantime, here are some highlights from our conversation:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Morgan Stanley was the lead underwriter for Uber. You don&#8217;t think Uber went public too late? It seems like it was enjoying a lot of momentum last year, so much so that it was reportedly told by bankers that it could be valued at $120 billion in an IPO &#8212; which is nearly triple where it&#8217;s valued right now. Did you think it would go out at that number?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>MG: If you look at how companies are valued, at any given point of time right now, public companies with growth prospects and margins that are not yet at their mature margin, I think you&#8217;ll find on average price targets by either analysts who work at banks or buy-side investors that can be 100%, 200%, and 300% different from low to high. That&#8217;s a typical spread. You can have somebody believe a company will be worth $30, $60 or $80 per share three years out. That&#8217;s a huge amount of variability.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So that variability isn&#8217;t based on different timelines?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>MG: It&#8217;s based on penetration. Let&#8217;s say, what, 100 million people or so [worldwide] have have been monthly active users of Uber, somewhere in that range. So what percentage of the population is that? Less than 1% or something. Is that 1% going to be\u00a0 2%, 3%, 6%, 10%, 20%? Half a percent, because people stop using it and turn instead to some flying [taxi]?<\/p>\n<p>So if you take all those variable, possible outcomes, you get huge variability in outcome. So it&#8217;s easy to say that everything should trade the same every day, but [look at what happened with Google]. You have some people saying maybe that is an an outcome that can happen here for companies, or maybe it won&#8217;t. Maybe they&#8217;ll [hit their] saturation [point] or face new competitors.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really easy to be a pundit and say, &#8216;It should be higher&#8217; or &#8216;It should be lower,&#8217; but investors are making decisions about that every day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is it your job to be as optimistic as possible about the pricing? How are <em>you<\/em> coming up with the number, given all these variables?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>MG: We think our job is to be realistically optimistic. If tech stops changing everything and software stops eating the world, there probably would be less of an optimistic bias. But fundamentally &#8212; it sounds obvious but sometimes people forget &#8212; you can only lose 100 percent of your money, and you can make multiples of your money. I don&#8217;t think VCs are as risk-averse as they say, by the way. Some 80% or 90% of investments end up under water, and 5% or 10% produce 10 or 20 or 30x and so that&#8217;s the portfolio approach. It&#8217;s not as pronounced with institutional investors investing at IPOs, but it&#8217;s the same concept: you can only lose 100 percent of your money.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you put five equal quantums of investment out to work in five different companies and one of them grows tenfold. Do I even need to tell you what happened with the other four to know you made money? Worst case, you&#8217;ve more than doubled your money, and therefore you&#8217;re probably going to lean into that again. So generally speaking, there&#8217;s an upward bias, but our job is to be realistic and to try to get that right. We view it as a sacred obligation. There&#8217;s variability and volatility within that. We try to give really good advice on receptivity. And when the process works as intended, we have predicted it as well as you can within a range of high variability.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignnone wp-image-1913455 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/49066938741_8f2c18e765_k.jpg\" alt=\"StrictlyVC\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/49066938741_8f2c18e765_k.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/49066938741_8f2c18e765_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/49066938741_8f2c18e765_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/49066938741_8f2c18e765_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/49066938741_8f2c18e765_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/49066938741_8f2c18e765_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>This summer on CNBC, Bill Gurley told viewers that banks, including the top banks, have mispriced IPOs to the tune of $170 billion over the last three years, meaning that&#8217;s the amount of money that companies left on the table. Do you think we need direct listings and can you explain why they could potentially be better?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>MG: Sure. We think Bill has done a great service by focusing a spotlight on the product, which we innovated with Spotify and then later with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/slack\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"slack\">Slack <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. We do love the product, we&#8217;re bullish on it.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;re asking how they work?<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Yes, as it relates to price discovery. So in a direct offering, you&#8217;re talking to people who own the stock and people who might want to buy the stock to figure out where they meet, which doesn&#8217;t sound that different than what goes on with a traditional IPO.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>MG: It&#8217;s actually different in a technical way. In a traditional IPO, there&#8217;s a range, let&#8217;s say $8 to $10. And the orders we&#8217;re taking every day for two weeks, let&#8217;s say, while the prospectus is filed, we&#8217;re taking orders from institutions [regarding] how many shares they want to buy within that range. That means generally within that range, they&#8217;re buying. It&#8217;s not binding but generally speaking, they&#8217;re going to follow through. If it&#8217;s outside of that range, we have to go back and ask them again. So if there&#8217;s a whole lot of demand and the number of shares being sold is fixed so that supply is fixed . . . the company&#8217;s goal is for oversubscription because they want an upward bias. They don&#8217;t want to trade up too much [and leave] money on the table and they don&#8217;t want to trade down at all &#8212; even a little bit &#8212; and they don&#8217;t want to trade flat because that could be [perceived] to be down; they want to trade up modestly. An exception was the Google IPO, which was designed to trade flat and traded up modestly, 14% or something like that.<\/p>\n<p>The range might be moved once, maybe twice &#8212; because there&#8217;s not a lot of time because there&#8217;s a regulatory review to turn it around &#8212; so [let&#8217;s say] it&#8217;s moved from $8 to 10 to $10 to $12 and there&#8217;s still much more demand than supply; it&#8217;s a judgment call as to, is that going to price at $14? $15? $12? Some investors might think it should trade at $25 while others think it should trade at $12. So there could be real variability there, and when trading opens, only the shares that were sold the night before in the IPO, some subset of them are trading and that&#8217;s it, everything else is locked up &#8212;\u00a0 the whole cap table. So for six months, it&#8217;s those same shares trading over and over, other than maybe [a small sampling] or investors of former employees who weren&#8217;t locked up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Okay, so let&#8217;s switch now to a direct listing.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>MG: So with a direct listing, the company is not issuing any shares. There is no underwriting where the banks buy the shares and sell them immediately to institutional and retail investors. But there is market making and the way the trading opens is similar but the size is totally flexible. There&#8217;s no lock-up. The whole cap table can essentially sell shares, versus the average IPO right now where I think it&#8217;s 16 percent of the cap table is sold in an IPO, and that&#8217;s down by half, by the way, from 15 years ago.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignnone wp-image-1914919 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen-Shot-2019-11-20-at-9.31.27-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1590\" height=\"874\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen-Shot-2019-11-20-at-9.31.27-PM.png 1590w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen-Shot-2019-11-20-at-9.31.27-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen-Shot-2019-11-20-at-9.31.27-PM.png?resize=300,165 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen-Shot-2019-11-20-at-9.31.27-PM.png?resize=768,422 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen-Shot-2019-11-20-at-9.31.27-PM.png?resize=680,374 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen-Shot-2019-11-20-at-9.31.27-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1590px) 100vw, 1590px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: So everyone can sell on day one, but are there handshake deals to ensure that not everyone dumps the shares on day one?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>MG: No, there&#8217;s no hidden agreement. They can sell as many shares as they want, but it&#8217;s going to depend on the price. The way a direct listing opens trading is a critical function because there&#8217;s no order book. No one has been taking orders for two weeks. The company has met with investors and done investor education. We&#8217;ve helped them write a prospectus, etcetera, but there are no orders, there&#8217;s no price range, and off we go. With Slack and Spotify, we were the bank responsible for the trading. What that means is on our trading floor in Times Square, our head trader, John Paci, and his team are in touch with anyone on the cap table who might want to sell and institutional investors who might want to buy, and what&#8217;s happening are two auctions at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>So in the traditional IPO, we were taking orders for size within a range that might move a little bit, [but] this is now any price. So take the buyers. [We&#8217;re trying to find out] who will pay $8 who will pay $12. Will anyone pay $16? So you&#8217;re taking that demand and sorting it by price. At the same time, you&#8217;re taking that supply, asking, &#8216;VC No. 1, is there a price at which you would sell shares?&#8217; If this person says, &#8216;Yes, but at $20&#8217; and we don&#8217;t have any demand at that price, then we figure out: who would sell at $18? Maybe VC No. 2 says they would sell 5 percent of their shares at $18. So we have some buyers, but it&#8217;s not enough to open trading with enough liquidity, which is key to all this. If you had one VC and one buyer, the buyer would go away. They&#8217;d say, &#8216;You didn&#8217;t tell me I was going to be trading with myself.&#8217; So we have to figure out where a simultaneous demand auction for the highest price, and a supply reverse auction for the lowest price clears and meets. If you can move a billion dollars worth of stock at $14 and get demand for a billion worth of stock, then that&#8217;s the price.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s then sent to the exchange where the exchange can take and add any other market maker or bank that has another seller or a buyer &#8212; so they add in, call it, another 30 percent from other brokers &#8212; and that produces the opening transaction.<\/p>\n<p><em>Stay tuned tomorrow for much more from that interview, where other discussion areas included whether lock-up periods might eventually be done away with in traditional IPOs, why VCs are suddenly so motivated to bang the drum on direct listings, and what really went wrong with Google&#8217;s auction-style offering back in 2004.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Michael Grimes has been called &#8220;Wall Street&#8217;s Silicon Valley whisperer&#8221; for landing a seemingly endless string of coveted deals for his bank, Morgan Stanley.

inhospitable surface, but on icy ocean moons like Saturn&#8217;s Enceladus, it might be better to come at things from the bottom up. This rover soon to be tested in Antarctica could one day roll along the underside of a miles-thick ice crust in the ocean of a strange world.<\/p>\n<p>It is thought that these oceanic moons may be <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/04\/13\/nasa-finds-evidence-of-life-supporting-conditions-on-saturns-moon-enceladus\/\">the most likely on which to find signs of life<\/a> past or present. But exploring them is no easy task.<\/p>\n<p>Little is known about these moons, and the missions we have planned are very much for surveying the surface, not penetrating their deepest secrets. But if we&#8217;re ever to know what&#8217;s going on under the miles of ice (water or other) we&#8217;ll need something that can survive and move around down there.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1914858\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/nasa-bruie-jpl-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/nasa-bruie-jpl-2.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/nasa-bruie-jpl-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/nasa-bruie-jpl-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/nasa-bruie-jpl-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/nasa-bruie-jpl-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/nasa-bruie-jpl-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Buoyant Rover for Under-Ice Exploration, or BRUIE, is a robotic exploration platform under development at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. It looks a bit like an industrial-strength hoverboard (remember those?), and as you might guess from its name, it cruises around the ice upside-down by making itself sufficiently buoyant to give its wheels traction.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve found that life often lives at interfaces, both the sea bottom and the ice-water interface at the top. Most submersibles have a challenging time investigating this area, as ocean currents might cause them to crash, or they would waste too much power maintaining position,&#8221; explained BRUIE&#8217;s lead engineer, Andy Klesh, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jpl.nasa.gov\/news\/news.php?feature=7543\">in a JPL blog post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike ordinary submersibles, though, this one would be able to stay in one place and even temporarily shut down while maintaining its position, waking only to take measurements. That could immensely extend its operational duration.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0AXk1nud73\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/20\/nasa-confirms-mission-to-jupiters-moon-europa-to-explore-its-icy-oceans\/\">NASA confirms mission to Jupiter&#8217;s moon Europa to explore its icy oceans<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;NASA confirms mission to Jupiter&#8217;s moon Europa to explore its icy oceans&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/20\/nasa-confirms-mission-to-jupiters-moon-europa-to-explore-its-icy-oceans\/embed\/#?secret=0AXk1nud73\" data-secret=\"0AXk1nud73\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>While the San Fernando Valley is a great analog for many dusty, sun-scorched extraterrestrial environments, it doesn&#8217;t really have anything like an ice-encrusted ocean to test in.

Twitter in revising its political ad rules ahead of what promises to be a brutal election season. But while the latter <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/15\/twitter-makes-its-political-ad-ban-official\/\">chose to ban political advertising altogether<\/a>, Google is mainly limiting the ability to target political demographics, and promises to take action against &#8220;demonstrably false claims.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/technology\/ads\/update-our-political-ads-policy\">In a blog post Wednesday afternoon<\/a>, the search giant explained the new rules in a way that is clearly intended to be understood by a broad audience, not the ad-buying elite.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Given recent concerns and debates about political advertising, and the importance of shared trust in the democratic process, we want to improve voters&#8217; confidence in the political ads they may see on our ad platforms,&#8221; wrote Scott Spencer, VP of product management at Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p>The primary change, he explained, will be the limitation of targeting terms that can be used for political advertising buys that appear in search, on display ads and on YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>Google knows an immense amount about every one of its users, and as such can display ads to people who like certain products, are concerned with certain issues and so on. But starting in December, if the ad is political in nature, it will only be able to be targeted to age, general and postal code. (Notably, Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/business.twitter.com\/en\/help\/ads-policies\/restricted-content-policies\/cause-based-advertising.html\">considers using ZIP codes &#8220;microtargeting&#8221;<\/a> and will not allow it for political content.)<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s nice, but it should be noted that such microtargeting may not be necessary for political issues, since advertisers can target search terms like &#8220;South San Jose city council candidates&#8221; and they&#8217;re off to the races. They just can&#8217;t send ads to people <em>because<\/em> they&#8217;re a Democrat, a Republican, support marriage equality, handgun restrictions, etc&#8230; but they <em>can<\/em> buy ads for the search terms &#8220;gay marriage,&#8221; &#8220;assault rifle ban&#8221; and other items.

Midtown New York, you won&#8217;t be able to just walk up to the counter and order something. Instead, you&#8217;ll need to download a mobile app.<\/p>\n<p>I experienced it for myself yesterday afternoon, when I \u2014 along with several other customers \u2014 pulled out my phone, downloaded the Bandit app, then used the app to create a profile, order and pay. A couple of minutes later, a barista called me up to the counter and handed me a pretty good cup of coffee.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, while Starbucks has been experimenting with mobile ordering and payment, Bandit is betting entirely on what co-founder and CEO Max Crowley called a &#8220;mobile-only&#8221; store.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, this model can lead to some initial awkwardness, particularly if random passersby don&#8217;t understand it. But there are friendly Bandit staff members on-hand to help, and Crowley (who was previously the general manager of Uber for Business) said that this model offers an opportunity to create &#8220;a whole new type of experience.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He pointed to the rapid growth of China&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/luckin-coffee-will-be-larger-than-starbucks-in-china-before-2020-cfo-153844070.html\">Luckin Coffee<\/a> as an inspiration, and suggested that, ultimately, Bandit should offer customers the most convenient way to satisfy their coffee cravings: Wherever they are, they open the app and order the drink they want. Then they&#8217;ll be told when it will be ready, and where to pick it up.<\/p>\n<p>Bandit can&#8217;t deliver that level of convenience for most customers quite yet, as it only has a single location. But Crowley said he&#8217;s rethought other aspects of the coffee shop model.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1914779\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/0C6A9605.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/0C6A9605.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/0C6A9605.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/0C6A9605.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/0C6A9605.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/0C6A9605.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/0C6A9605.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For one thing, this first Bandit store is located in what&#8217;s essentially a raw retail space. Crowley said his team has developed an 11&#8217;x11&#8242; countertop where all the coffee is prepared \u2014 it&#8217;s assembled elsewhere and just needs to be plugged in, eliminating the need for an extensive buildout.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We can launch [a new location] in a few hours, and we can do it at about a tenth the cost of a traditional store,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>So the plan is to launch four or five more New York stores in the coming months, and to expand beyond New York by the end of the first quarter of 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Crowley added that by keeping costs down, Bandit can also keep its coffee affordable: &#8220;I don\u2019t think an iced latte needs to be $6 or $7. Our goal is to be less expensive than Starbucks.&#8221; (My coffee yesterday, for example, cost me $2.) It&#8217;s also experimenting with other pricing models, starting with a $20 subscription that gets you an unlimited number of $1 drinks for a month.<\/p>\n<p>And if this phone and pop up-focused mentality sounds a little transactional \u2014 maybe even a little soulless \u2014 I will note that the actual coffee shop didn&#8217;t feel that way at all. While the space was a bit bare, it was eye-catching, with several large games like cornhole set up for customers. Most importantly, people weren&#8217;t just rushing in to pick up their coffee \u2014 they were actually hanging out.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When we did some rudimentary scouting of coffee shop locations, we saw that about 80% of customers are grabbing their coffee and leaving,&#8221; Crowley said. &#8220;That is definitely core to us, making it super easy to grab it and leave, fulfilling drink orders in less than a minute. All of that said, in the future, we&#8217;re going to have this portfolio of different kinds of spaces, different kinds of experiences.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"RHKPlYvk9s\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/11\/bottomless-has-a-solution-for-lazy-coffee-addicts\/\">Bottomless has a solution for lazy coffee addicts<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;Bottomless has a solution for lazy coffee addicts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/11\/bottomless-has-a-solution-for-lazy-coffee-addicts\/embed\/#?secret=RHKPlYvk9s\" data-secret=\"RHKPlYvk9s\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you wander into the Bandit coffee shop in Midtown New York, you won&#8217;t be able to just walk up to the counter and order something.

href=\"https:\/\/variety.com\/2019\/digital\/news\/sonos-snips-acquisition-q4-2019-earnings-1203410771\/\">Variety reported on Wednesday<\/a>. Snips, which had been developing dedicated smart device assistants that can operate primarily locally, instead of relying on consistently round-tripping voice data to the cloud, could help Sonos set up a voice control option for its customers that has &#8220;privacy in mind&#8221; and is focused more narrowly on music control than on being a general-purpose smart assistant.<\/p>\n<p>Sonos has worked with both <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and their voice assistants, providing support for either on their more recent products, including the Sonos Beam and Sonos One smart speakers. Both of these require an active cloud connection to work, however, and have received scrutiny from consumers and consumer protection groups recently for how they handle the data they collect from users. They&#8217;ve introduced additional controls to help users navigate their own data sharing, but Sonos CEO Patrick Spence noted in an interview with Variety that one of the things the company can do in building its own voice features is developing them &#8220;with privacy in mind.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Notably, Sonos has introduced a version of its Sonos One that leaves out the microphone hardware altogether &#8212; the Sonos One SL introduced earlier this fall. The fact that they saw opportunity in a mic-less second version of the Sonos One suggests it&#8217;s likely there are a decent number of customers who like the option of a product that&#8217;s not round-tripping any information with a remote server. Spence also seemed quick to point out that Sonos wouldn&#8217;t seek to compete with its voice assistant partners, however, since anything they build will be focused much more specifically on music.<\/p>\n<p>You can imagine how local machine learning would be able to handle commands like skipping, pausing playback and adjusting volume (and maybe an even more advanced feature like playing back a saved playlist), without having to connect to any kind of cloud service. It seems like what Spence envisions is something like that which can provide basic controls, while still allowing the option for a customer to enable one of the more full-featured voice assistants depending on their preference.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, partnerships continue to prove lucrative for Sonos: Its team-up with Ikea resulted in 30,000 speakers sold on launch day, the company also shared alongside its earnings. That&#8217;s a lot to move in one day, especially in this category.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sonos revealed during its quarterly earnings report that it has acquired voice assistant startup Snips in a $37 million cash deal, Variety reported on Wednesday.

class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Science Corporation, the makers of a deal-finding browser add-on and mobile application, for $4 billion, mostly cash. The acquisition, which is PayPal&#8217;s largest to date, will give the payments giant a foothold earlier in the customer&#8217;s shopping journey. Instead of only competing on the checkout page against credit cards or Apple Pay, for example, PayPal will leap ahead to become a part of the deal discovery process, as well.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, Honey&#8217;s 17 million monthly active users take advantage of its suite of money-saving tools to track prices, get alerts, make lists, browse offers and participate in an Ebates-like rewards program called Honey Gold. Its users tend to be younger, millennial shoppers, both male and female.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal aims to add Honey&#8217;s technology to its own product line, expanding its reach to PayPal&#8217;s 300 million users.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s exciting is that we can take the functionality Honey now offers &#8212; which is product discovery, price tracking, offers and loyalty &#8212; and build that into the PayPal and Venmo experiences,&#8221; explains PayPal SVP of Global Consumer Products and Technology, and former Xoom CEO, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/john-kunze-5724a86\/\">John Kunze<\/a>. &#8220;When Honey says they&#8217;re putting money in the pockets of their customers &#8212; that&#8217;s perfectly in line with what we want to do. We want to make digital commerce and financial services more affordable, easier to use, more fun and more accessible to people around the world,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, PayPal&#8217;s network of 24 million merchant partners will gain the ability to offer targeted and more personalized promotions to consumers as a means of acquiring new business and driving increased sales. PayPal Credit may also be integrated into Honey to help finance larger purchases.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1914616\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/honey_extension_screen.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/honey_extension_screen.png 2918w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/honey_extension_screen.png?resize=150,86 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/honey_extension_screen.png?resize=300,171 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/honey_extension_screen.png?resize=768,439 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/honey_extension_screen.png?resize=680,389 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/honey_extension_screen.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Honey has flown under the radar to some extent since its founding in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Originally only a web browser extension, Honey tracks sales and retailers&#8217; promo codes, as a rival to RetailMeNot and others. What makes the extension so useful is that it automatically tries all the eligible promo codes for you during checkout then selects the one that provided the most savings and applies it on your behalf. This helps shoppers feel more comfortable with their purchases and reduces shopping cart abandonment.<\/p>\n<p>The company also rolled out features to inform shoppers of an item&#8217;s price history, including the historical pricing of any product on Amazon&#8217;s marketplace.

It provides a broad portfolio of services to simplify the consumer shopping experience, while at the same time making it more affordable and rewarding,&#8221; said Dan Schulman, president and CEO of PayPal, in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The combination of Honey\u2019s complementary consumer products with our platform will significantly enhance our ability to drive engagement and play a more meaningful role in the daily lives of our consumers. As a partner of choice for our merchants, this is another way that we can help them build and strengthen their customer relationships, provide personalized offers, and drive incremental sales. The combination of Honey and PayPal adds another significant and meaningful dimension to our two-sided platform,&#8221; Schulman added.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter wp-image-1914620 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/honey_macys_screens-11.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2917\" height=\"1667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/honey_macys_screens-11.png 2917w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/honey_macys_screens-11.png?resize=150,86 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/honey_macys_screens-11.png?resize=300,171 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/honey_macys_screens-11.png?resize=768,439 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/honey_macys_screens-11.png?resize=680,389 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/honey_macys_screens-11.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2917px) 100vw, 2917px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The acquisition also gives PayPal a way to fight back against the increased competition from Apple, Google, Facebook and other tech companies that have entered the payments market in recent years.

href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/gcp\/bare-metal-solution-enabling-specialized-workloads-in-google-cloud\">announced<\/a> the launch of a new bare metal service, dubbed the <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/solutions\/bare-metal\/\">Bare Metal Solution<\/a>. We aren&#8217;t talking about bare metal servers offered directly by Google Cloud here, though. Instead, we&#8217;re talking about a solution that enterprises can use to run their specialized workloads on certified hardware that&#8217;s co-located in the Google Cloud data centers and directly connect them to Google Cloud&#8217;s suite of other services. The main workload that makes sense for this kind of setup is databases, Google notes, and specifically Oracle Database.<\/p>\n<p>Bare Metal Solution is, as the name implies, a fully integrated and fully managed solution for setting up this kind of infrastructure. It involves a completely managed hardware infrastructure that includes servers and the rest of the data center facilities like power and cooling; support contracts with Google Cloud and billing are handled through Google&#8217;s systems, as well as an SLA. The software that&#8217;s deployed on those machines is managed by the customer &#8212; not Google.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Google_Cloud_Bare_Metal_Solutions.max-1200x1200.png\"><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1914543\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Google_Cloud_Bare_Metal_Solutions.max-1200x1200.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Google_Cloud_Bare_Metal_Solutions.max-1200x1200.png 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Google_Cloud_Bare_Metal_Solutions.max-1200x1200.png?resize=150,63 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Google_Cloud_Bare_Metal_Solutions.max-1200x1200.png?resize=300,126 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Google_Cloud_Bare_Metal_Solutions.max-1200x1200.png?resize=768,322 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Google_Cloud_Bare_Metal_Solutions.max-1200x1200.png?resize=680,285 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Google_Cloud_Bare_Metal_Solutions.max-1200x1200.png?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The overall idea, though, is clearly to make it easier for enterprises with specialized workloads that can&#8217;t easily be migrated to the cloud to still benefit from the cloud-based services that need access to the data from these systems. Machine learning is an obvious example, but Google also notes that this provides these companies with a bridge to slowly modernize their tech infrastructure in general (where &#8220;modernize&#8221; tends to mean &#8220;move to the cloud&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These specialized workloads often require certified hardware and complicated licensing and support agreements,&#8221; Google writes. &#8220;This solution provides a path to modernize your application infrastructure landscape, while maintaining your existing investments and architecture. With Bare Metal Solution, you can bring your specialized workloads to Google Cloud, allowing you access and integration with GCP services with minimal latency.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/specialized_workloads_2x.png\"><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1914702\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/specialized_workloads_2x.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"595\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/specialized_workloads_2x.png 1035w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/specialized_workloads_2x.png?resize=150,87 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/specialized_workloads_2x.png?resize=300,174 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/specialized_workloads_2x.png?resize=768,446 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/specialized_workloads_2x.png?resize=680,395 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/specialized_workloads_2x.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Because this service is co-located with Google Cloud, there are no separate ingress and egress charges for data that moves between Bare Metal Solution and Google Cloud in the same region.<\/p>\n<p>The servers for this solution, which are certified to run a wide range of applications (including Oracle Database) range from dual-socket 16-core systems with 384 GB of RAM to quad-socket servers with 112 cores and 3072 GB of RAM. Pricing is on a monthly basis, with a preferred term length of 36 months.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, this isn&#8217;t the kind of solution that you self-provision, so the only way to get started &#8212; and get pricing information &#8212; is to talk to Google&#8217;s sales team. But this is clearly the kind of service that we should expect from Google Cloud, which is heavily focused on providing as many enterprise-ready services as possible.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google Cloud today announced the launch of a new bare metal service, dubbed the Bare Metal Solution.
