Now, dancehall\u2019s first openly gay solo artist Demaro hopes his music can break stigmas in the Caribbean toward the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe 34-year-old\u2019s midtempo debut single \u201cMi Readi\u201d features his tender, uplifting baritone over a swaying fusion of soca, hip-hop, Afrobeat and dancehall. The accompanying music video -- directed by Tony Valles and premiering exclusively on Billboard below -- captures the chiseled singer/songwriter, along with a few bystanders, dancing and vibing on the streets of New York City and inside a laundromat with Jamaican drag performer Jahlove Serrano.\n\n\u201cI want people to listen to my music with an open mind and know that I\u2019m a gay artist who\u2019s been through some struggles, but I\u2019m still here not giving up,\u201d said Demaro, who wrote \u201cMi Readi\u201d in 45 minutes. \u201cI\u2019m ready to take over.\u201d\n\nDemaro Brown grew up in Westmoreland, a rural area of western Jamaica near Negril. Raised the third of four children by a single mother, he recognized his truth early on but remained closeted because Jamaica didn\u2019t have rights protecting homosexuality.\n\nOn one occasion, Demaro was stabbed by someone random in his leg but managed to escape. He got a visa when he turned 22 and relocated to New York to escape his surroundings. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that I would go to hell,\u201d Demaro said. \u201cIn Jamaica, you just cannot be a gay man down there at all. That\u2019s a no-no. Even now, you have to be on the DL. We still had our way of getting around, but you had to be discreet in the streets.\n\n\u201cI just knew that I wanted more, and Jamaica never had much to offer me,\u201d Demaro continues. \u201cI never had much help in Jamaica navigating myself and knowing that I had these feelings. There was no one there that I could talk to about what I was feeling.\u201d\n\nOnce Demaro relocated to New York, he landed opportunities to style and design for Francis Henry and collaborate with celebrity stylist June Ambrose. Even with some minor successes, Demaro fell on hard times, became homeless and battled depression.\n\nDemaro has gone to therapy for the last two years to overcome his past and come to terms with his sexuality. Those sessions birthed the newcomer\u2019s active workout regimen, healthy lifestyle and musical career.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to talk to someone about what\u2019s going on with you,\u201d said Demaro, who came out to his immediate family last year. \u201cI just started writing and expressing myself. A lot of things weren\u2019t right with me, and therapy reminded me of my value as a human. It was like starting my life all over again.\u201d\n\nDemaro\u2019s debut EP, Good Vibes Only, is tentatively set for a spring 2020 release around Pride Month. He opened for teen Island Records signee Kidd Kenn. Excited for his upcoming project, the performer certainly has one specific audience in mind.\n\n\u201cI want younger gay men, especially in Jamaica, to keep on fighting,\u201d Demaro said. \u201cDon\u2019t give up. You\u2019re beautiful and going to be OK. Don\u2019t give up on yourself. We\u2019ve all gone through bad times, but young men must keep pushing.\u201d\n\nWatch Demaro's \"Mi Readi\" video below:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Christopher Daniel"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 10:02:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Jamaica\u2019s music scene graces listeners with infectious riddims and social commentary, but its lyrical content is also largely homophobic.
