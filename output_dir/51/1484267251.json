The ordinance increased the city's minimum wage to $11.50 by January 2017. The state's minimum wage will also increase to $13 for companies with at least 26 employees, although San Diego's ordinance does not have an employment minimum.\n\nEmployees will continue to earn sick leave as outlined by their employer and earned sick leave can be capped at 40 hours per year, according to the city. Employers are required to post notices of the changes at their workplace in accordance with the minimum wage and sick leave ordinance.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["news", ""], "tags": [], "authors": ["City News Service"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The city of San Diego's hourly minimum wage increased Wednesday from $12 to $13 for employees who work at least two hours per week.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/32c5c47ad8a96c3cb7b28f94eca59eb3?s=32", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=586932831", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The city of San Diego's hourly minimum wage increased Wednesday from $12 to $13 for employees who work at least two hours per week.", "keywords": "news,", "google-site-verification": "JhJ2Tn7m1Yo8tYXxw5c1uNxVjlCQqLbBaI536kENuQU", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "City of San Diego\u2019s minimum wage increases to $13 per hour", "url": "https://fox5sandiego.com/2020/01/01/city-of-san-diegos-minimum-wage-increases-to-13-per-hour/", "description": "The city of San Diego's hourly minimum wage increased Wednesday from $12 to $13 for employees who work at least two hours per week.", "site_name": "fox5sandiego.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://tribkswb.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/blank-check.gif", "width": 692, "height": 384, "alt": "blank-check"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-02T01:10:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T01:10:35+00:00", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox5sandiego", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox5sandiego"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@fox5sandiego", "site": "@fox5sandiego", "text": {"title": "City of San Diego\u2019s minimum wage increases to $13 per\u00a0hour"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://tribkswb.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/blank-check.gif?w=640", "alt": "blank-check"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "tribune-video": "true", "word-count": 130, "application-name": "fox5sandiego.com", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Get the latest San Diego news, breaking news, weather, traffic, sports, entertainment and video from fox5sandiego.com.
