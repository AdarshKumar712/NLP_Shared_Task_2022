Five people are missing.\n\nWe\u2019ve lost 480 million \u2013 almost half a billion \u2013 animal lives.\n\nAt least 1200 homes have been destroyed.\n\nBut these are just the numbers, these figures don\u2019t put into perspective the emotional turmoil, the fear, the worry, the heartbreak.\n\nHere\u2019s an insight into the fear. Tracey and her family ran for their lives last week as fire licked its way up their holiday home. Post continue after video.\n\nIf we were to compare the destruction on a global scale, the 2019 Amazon fires (across four countries) destroyed 906,000 hectares, and the California fires burnt 102,000 hectares. The fires in NSW alone have burnt through an area the size of Belgium.\n\nThe fires in Australia right now are unprecedented. The scale of this disaster is unfathomable.\n\nThe even more terrifying reality is that they\u2019re far from over. Yes the fires are still burning, but we\u2019re also now facing a humanitarian crisis because of the scale and unrelenting nature of them.\n\nVictoria\u2019s Gippsland.\n\nThere are 17 people missing in the bushfire affected communities of Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland region, with one person confirmed dead.\n\nBuchan resident Mick Roberts had not made contact with family for more than 24 hours and yesterday his niece Leah Parson confirmed he had been found dead at his home.\n\nAs authorities search for those still missing, residents in the East Gippsland and Alpine areas have been urged to leave now ahead of Friday and the weekend. They\u2019re being told they have a \u201csmall window of opportunity\u201d to get out.\n\nAbout 24 communities are isolated and reaching them to deliver supplies has been difficult.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["bushfire", "australia-2", "news-3"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 10:43:22 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Bushfire Australia 2019: Thousands are being evacuated, thousands are stuck and running out of food and water and the threat is returning Saturday.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "description": "Bushfire Australia 2019: Thousands are being evacuated, thousands are stuck and running out of food and water and the threat is returning Saturday.", "og": {"site_name": "Mamamia", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.mamamia.com.au/bushfire-australia-2019/", "type": "article", "updated_time": "2020-01-02T10:43:22+00:00", "title": "17 missing in Victoria, and a humanitarian crisis in NSW: All the latest from the bushfire crisis.", "image": "https://cdn.mamamia.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/01234322/FIRE-V2-social.jpg", "description": "Terrified, devastated, trapped."}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"section": "news", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mamamia", "published_time": "2020-01-02T10:43:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T10:43:22+00:00", "tag": "news-3"}, "DC.date.issued": "2020-01-02T10:43:22+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 142149825944}, "news_keywords": "australia-2, bushfire, news-3", "twitter": {"site": "@Mamamia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "original-source": "https://www.mamamia.com.au/bushfire-australia-2019/"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.mamamia.com.au/bushfire-australia-2019/"}
