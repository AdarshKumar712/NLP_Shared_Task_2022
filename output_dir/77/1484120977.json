Since May 2018, when the disease was identified in the region, 1.2 million birds in the area have been euthanized.\n\nCareless bird owners who haven\u2019t followed protocol for the highly contagious virus \u2014 including scofflaws who\u2019ve ignored quarantines \u2014 are to blame, according to State Veterinarian Annette Jones.\n\n\u201cOver the past month, virulent Newcastle disease cases have increased because people have violated the \u2026 regional quarantine by moving infected birds or contaminated equipment,\u201d Jones says in a statement on the California Department of Food and Agriculture site. \u201cPut simply, your birds can spread the disease before they show symptoms, so the only way to stop it is to not move birds \u2014 period \u2014 if you are in the CDFA regional quarantine area. \u2026 Stopping the spread will take the combined effort of all bird owners.\u201d\n\nAll of Los Angeles County and most of San Bernardino and Riverside counties are under quarantine. Additionally, inspectors, auditors and service providers in those three counties as well as Orange, Ventura and San Diego counties have been ordered by Jones to suspend most visits to poultry areas until at least March 1.\n\nProperly cooked poultry and eggs do not pose a health threat to people, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\n\u201cIn very rare instances, people working directly with sick birds can become infected,\u201d according to the USDA website. \u201cSymptoms are usually very mild and limited to conjunctivitis and/or influenza-like symptoms.\u201d\n\nDisease ebbs, flows\n\nOf the 1.2 million birds euthanized in Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties since May 2018, about 1.1 million were connected to commercial and industrial operations. Most of the remaining birds killed were pets or show birds. The majority of the birds killed have been chickens.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that 470 premises in California have been infected with Newcastle disease as of Dec. 27. Of those, 262 are in Riverside County, 158 in San Bernardino County, 46 in Los Angeles County and one each in Ventura, Alameda and San Diego counties. The number of birds euthanized in December was not immediately available.\n\nThe 14 locations where the disease was identified in December consisted of 11 in San Bernardino County, two in Riverside County and one in Los Angeles County.\n\nThe epidemic was waning through the summer, with the disease identified at just four locations from June through September \u2014 and none in October. The numbers began creeping up in November, with the infections found at five locations in San Bernardino County.\n\nTwo of the areas with infected birds in November and December were pet and feed stores, with the rest identified as backyard show chickens.\n\nSouthern California\u2019s previous Newcastle epidemic was in 2002-2003, when 3.2 million birds were euthanized.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Top Stories WDN", "Top Stories PE", "top stories rdf", "top stories sun", "Top Stories Breeze", "top stories ivdb", "Top Stories LADN", "Environment", "Top Stories PSN", "Top Stories SGVT", "Top Stories LBPT", "Top Stories OCR"], "authors": ["Martin Wisckol", "Martin Wisckol Covers Coastal Environment", "Development.
