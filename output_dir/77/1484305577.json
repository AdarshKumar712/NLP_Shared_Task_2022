The reality is that corporations chose not to invest in employees but stock buy-backs and other corporate benefits.\n\nTo make matters worse, the law created so many tax loopholes that tax collection from corporations collapsed. With fewer revenues coming into the federal government, the deficit Republicans once claimed was too high, has ballooned to the highest ever.\n\n\u201cITEP found that the effective corporate tax rate for 379 profitable Fortune 500 corporations was just 11.3 percent last year,\u201d wrote Clemente and Rice. \u201cThat\u2019s about half the rate Trump\u2019s new law established, which slashed the previous rate by 40 percent. More than 90 corporate titans \u2014 including Amazon, Chevron, FedEx, IBM, General Motors and Netflix \u2014 paid zero in federal income taxes last year.\u201d\n\nThe called the claim that the tax cuts would benefit the middle class \u201cphony.\u201d Trump even claimed that the new law would \u201ccost me a fortune,\u201d as a wealthy taxpayer. One of the greatest pieces of evidence that it was all a lie came from Trump\u2019s last-minute promise before the 2018 election that he was working on a \u201cmiddle-class tax cut.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tax reduction of 10 percent for the middle class,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Oct. 23, 2018. \u201cBusiness will not enter into it, and this will be on top of the tax reduction that the middle class has already gotten, and we\u2019re putting in a resolution probably this week.\u201d\n\nOver a year later, neither Trump nor Republicans have proposed such a tax cut.\n\n\u201cTrump and his family have undoubtedly benefited by millions of dollars from at least five features of the law, ranging from lower top tax rates to a weakened estate tax,\u201d wrote Clemente and Rice. \u201cOf course, we can\u2019t be sure exactly how much they\u2019ve saved because Trump refuses to release his tax returns.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump claimed that the GOP tax cut would result in a raise of $4,000 for working families. His\n\nTrump promised his corporate tax cuts would result in an average pay raise of $4,000 for working families. His economic advisers claimed $9,000. Their report also said that wages would increase as a result of the tax cuts. All three of the claims were false.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cCensus data show that median family income instead grew by about $500 in the first year after the tax cuts, the smallest annual increase in five years,\u201d Clemente and Rice said. \u201cA close look at [the] Bureau of Labor Statistics figures shows that the growth rate in wages was just 0.4 percent in the two years since the tax cut. Compare that with wage growth of 0.7 percent in the last two years of President Obama\u2019s administration.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the wealthy scored big. \u201cIn 2018, owners of the elite group of non-corporate businesses that earned more than $1 million received nearly half the benefits from the part of the law touted as a small-business tax cut,\u201d the report said.\n\nStill, Trump intends to run his 2020 campaign touting his economic success. Clearly, that success was only isolated to a few.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead the full editorial at The LA Times.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Sarah K.
