Such sentiments are reductionist and do the harm of making us have a false sense of victory.\n\n\u201cThe bitter truth is that Nigeria is still in the throes of economic instability, with more people losing jobs and the attendant outcome of more children being out of school and more families having hard time in accessing basic needs of life.\n\n\u201cIn this New Year, however, I will rather ask that Nigerians stand together with renewed vigour and determination to battle the hydra-headed demon of insecurity that has plagued us in the past decade.\n\n\u201cWe must challenge the inadequacies that made us become the global headquarters of extreme poverty; much as we must work hard and fast enough to eliminate the scourge of out-of-school children in the country. These are the challenges that this new decade has thrown at us and we cannot afford to slumber and submit to defeat\u201d.\n\nAtiku observed that the problems of extreme poverty and scant investments in education played huge roles in fueling the problems of violent extremism that characterised the past decade.\n\nHe warned that the country cannot win the fight against terrorism without reducing or eliminating poverty and illiteracy.\n\nContinuing, Atiku said, \u201cThe reality of this new decade requires of us to recalibrate our approaches and to pursue some tough choices. If failure is not an option, then we must let go of our egos and conveniences.\n\n\u201cIn this new decade, we must start to do things differently if we are honest about our desire for a better and prosperous future. There must be a deliberate effort to improve the material wellbeing of the people, by lifting millions of Nigerians out of the extreme poverty belt at a start, and to prosperity. Government must rethink many of its policies that are sinking more people into the abyss of extreme poverty.\n\nRead Also; We\u2019ll not disappoint you in 2020, APC assures Nigerians\n\n\u201cIt is incumbent on government at all levels to pursue policies that will provide decent housing to the mass majority; put food on the table; provide healthcare and education. We cannot continue to do things the same way and expect a different outcome. It is therefore high time we caused a rejig of economic policies that will promote an expansion of the economy and create job opportunities aplenty.\n\n\u201cAt the individual level, this moment calls for more empathy and sacrifice. The New Year and a new decade come with the opportunity to make better impressions in our lives and in the lives of people around us.\n\n\u201cI wish to restate that our collective call for rule of law and our history about the struggle for democratic rule did not envisage a situation where judicial pronouncements would be worthless than the paper upon which they are rendered.\n\n\u201cIt is a bad advertisement for the country and its democracy if declarations made by the courts are not respected without the executive arm of government agreeing to same.\n\n\u201cAny democracy is not worth the appellation if the principle of separation of powers is not ingrained in it. In the new year, government should not pretend to be democratic, but rather act according to the fundamentals of a democracy.\n\n\u201cAbove all, I expect that in the New Year, there will be a better observance of rule of law and greater respect for citizens\u2019 democratic rights.\n\n\u201cWhile we anticipate a change of attitude across board in the new year and new decade, I wish every Nigerian a happy and prosperous 2020\u201d.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["featured"], "authors": ["Desert Herald"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 08:37:18 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://desertherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-favicon-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "2019 not a successful year for Nigerians \u2013 Atiku", "description": "Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has described 2020 as symbolic in many ways, saying it\u2019s time to work for...", "url": "https://desertherald.com/2019-not-a-successful-year-for-nigerians-atiku/", "site_name": "Desert Herald Newspaper", "image": "https://desertherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Atiku-blasts-Osinbajo.jpg"}, "article": {"tag": "featured", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T08:37:18+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has described 2020 as symbolic in many ways, saying it\u2019s time to work for...", "title": "2019 not a successful year for Nigerians \u2013 Atiku", "image": "https://desertherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Atiku-blasts-Osinbajo.jpg", "url": "https://desertherald.com/2019-not-a-successful-year-for-nigerians-atiku/"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "fb": {"pages": 185755844885294}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://desertherald.com/2019-not-a-successful-year-for-nigerians-atiku/?ia_markup=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://desertherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-favicon-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://desertherald.com/2019-not-a-successful-year-for-nigerians-atiku/"}
