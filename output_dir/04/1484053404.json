As we passed the lobby of the Emporium hotel on the footpath of Grey Street, we heard a very loud bang next to us.\n\n\"[We] saw a man fall onto the tray of a truck that was parked out the front of the entrance and bounce off onto the concrete road.\n\n\"We were thankfully spared as he could have easily fallen on top of us, or in front of us.\"\n\nShe added: \"My friend was the worst to be affected as she witnessed him falling and hitting the ground.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"Then people started screaming and running towards the body. Police started flooding in and we told them what we had witnessed.\"\n\nRoads in the area were temporarily closed while police and emergency services attended, but were later reopened.\n\nPolice are not treating the death as suspicious.\n\nEmporium Hotel manager Charles Martin passed on his condolences to the man's family and said support will be made available for anyone who witnessed the incident.\n\nHe told the Courier Mail: \"The first priority has been to hotel guests and team members who may have witnessed the incident... counselling services have been arranged for those needing support to deal with the incident.\"\n\nNorth Brisbane District Superintendent Chris Stream. Credit: 7 News\n\nThe horrific incident happened as the rest of the country was preparing to step into the new decade.\n\nPolice in Queensland said that, although there were 46 arrests overnight, overall the partygoers and fun seekers were pretty well behaved.\n\nMost arrests were for charges of for anti-social behaviour, alcohol and drug related incidents - with 29 of the 49 charges being for 'public nuisance'.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Australia"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Claire Reid"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Horrified eyewitness saw the man fall", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/assets/apple-touch-icon.dea06a7eba196d4ef9271dd460a06d61.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#292930", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/images/theme/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#292930", "fb": {"app_id": 331116490288120, "pages": 199098633470668}, "twitter": {"site": "@ladbible", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/thumbnail?type=jpeg&url=http://beta.ems.ladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/cbb14c075e0c2cb9e631c6939c80102e.png&quality=70&width=808"}, "description": "Horrified eyewitness saw the man fall", "keywords": "Australia", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"title": "Australian Man Falls To His Death From Rooftop Bar On New Year's Eve", "description": "Horrified eyewitness saw the man fall", "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/thumbnail?type=jpeg&url=http://beta.ems.ladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/cbb14c075e0c2cb9e631c6939c80102e.png&quality=70&width=808", "url": "https://www.ladbible.com/news/news-australian-man-falls-to-his-death-from-rooftop-bar-on-new-years-eve-20200101", "type": "website"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.ladbible.com/news/news-australian-man-falls-to-his-death-from-rooftop-bar-on-new-years-eve-20200101"}
