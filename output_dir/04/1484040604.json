The nurses were awesome.\u201d\n\nLast week, Juan Moreno died trying to save his children after their Christmas tree apparently caught fire, sending flames throughout their apartment. Three of their children \u2014 4-year-old Janessa, 8-year-old Isaac and 12-year-old Maria \u2014 also died.\n\nThe youth center wanted the surviving family, Christina and two of her children, to know that they were not alone.\n\n\u201cAnytime that there\u2019s a tragedy like that with a family, you just want to rally around and help them out and show God\u2019s love and kindness,\u201d Ruth Collins, a community member, said.\n\nFamily members said the outpouring of support has been a bright spot in a very dark time.\n\nJuan Moreno\u2019s sister, Diana Ramirez, said in the past she would have turned to him in times like this.\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel real,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m still gonna get a phone call from him or a text message from the kids or something. It just doesn\u2019t feel real.\u201d\n\nThe family said they miss his jokes and the children\u2019s laughter, but said they are thankful for the community that has embraced them.\n\n\u201cThank you for all your love and your support and just all of your wonderful hugs,\u201d McGraw Moreno said.\n\nThe Tuesday vigil was also a fundraiser to help cover expenses for the Moreno family. A GoFundMe page has also been set up. As of Tuesday, it had raised more than $44,000 of its initial $20,000 goal.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["hemet", "hemet fire", "isaac", "janessa", "juan moreno", "maria"], "tags": ["Isaac", "Hemet", "Juan Moreno", "Maria", "Janessa", "Hemet fire"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A grieving mother who lost three of her children and her husband in a tragic fire in Hemet the day after Christmas is speaking out and thanking the community and first responders.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/06/cropped-la-favicon-512.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "%tags%", "keywords": "hemet, hemet fire, isaac, janessa, juan moreno, maria", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "fb": {"pages": 57972945858}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"title": "Family Holds Vigil For Father, 3 Children Who Died In Hemet Apartment Fire Day After Christmas", "image": {"identifier": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/Victims-of-Hemet-Fire.jpg?w=1280", "secure_url": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/Victims-of-Hemet-Fire.jpg?w=1280", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "A grieving mother who lost three of her children and her husband in a tragic fire in Hemet the day after Christmas is speaking out and thanking the community and first responders.", "type": "article", "url": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/12/31/family-holds-vigil-for-father-3-children-who-died-in-hemet-apartment-fire-day-after-christmas/"}, "article": {"published_time": "2019-12-31T18:17:26+00:00", "suggested-social-copy": "A grieving mother who lost three of her children and her husband in a tragic fire in Hemet the day after Christmas is speaking out and thanking the community and first responders.", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/Victims-of-Hemet-Fire.jpg?w=1280", "title": "Family Holds Vigil For Father, 3 Children Who Died In Hemet Apartment Fire Day After Christmas", "description": "A grieving mother who lost three of her children and her husband in a tragic fire in Hemet the day after Christmas is speaking out and thanking the community and first responders.", "site": "CBSLA"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/06/cropped-la-favicon-512.png?w=270", "description": "A grieving mother who lost three of her children and her husband in a tragic fire in Hemet the day after Christmas is speaking out and thanking the community and first responders."}, "canonical_link": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/12/31/family-holds-vigil-for-father-3-children-who-died-in-hemet-apartment-fire-day-after-christmas/"}
