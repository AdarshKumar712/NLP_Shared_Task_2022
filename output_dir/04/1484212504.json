He denied any misuse that day. Now he was not only admitting it, but asking for help.\n\nBut Gatzke-Plamann had no resources to offer. She and the patient searched the internet while still on the phone, trying to find somewhere nearby that could help. No luck.\n\nHere was a patient with a family and job who spiraled into addiction due to doctor-prescribed pain pills, yet the community\u2019s barebones health system left him on his own to find treatment \u2014 which he later did, 65 miles away. If that situation was going to change in Necedah, it was up to Gatzke-Plamann.\n\n\u201cThat weekend I went home and I said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to do something different,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\n\nIn many ways, rural communities like Necedah have become the face of the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths are more common in rural areas than in urban ones. And rural doctors prescribe opioids more often by far, despite a nationwide decline in prescribing rates since 2012. Meanwhile, rural Americans have fewer alternatives to treat their very real pain, and they disproportionately lack access to effective addiction medication such as buprenorphine.\n\nFor rural physicians like Gatzke-Plamann, the burden of responding to the opioid epidemic falls on their already-loaded shoulders.\n\nRural residents report more pain\n\nOne reason there are more opioid prescriptions in the rural United States: Those residents report more chronic pain. Rural communities skew older, meaning they disproportionately deal with painful conditions related to aging, such as arthritis.\n\nInjuries also appear to be more common among communities more dependent on physically demanding jobs, such as mining and logging.\n\nFor 62-year-old Necedah resident Michael Kruchten, the chronic pain stems from chemotherapy and radiation therapy treatments he received for lung cancer in 2011.\n\nKruchten is cancer free now, but the treatments left him with permanent and severe nerve damage in his hands and feet.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s a burning \u2014 a continuous burning,\u201d Kruchten said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s just like a sharp jolt of pain. And then sometimes it\u2019s just pain, pain, pain.\u201d\n\nThe pain forced him to stop working at the ethanol plant in Necedah. Daily chores became challenging. The pain would keep him awake a night, leaving him pounding his pillow in frustration.\n\nGatzke-Plamann tries to avoid prescribing opioids when she can, but alternatives are limited. The nearest physical therapy is in Mauston, a 17-mile drive south. Treatments such as cognitive therapy for pain require drives to Madison, Marshfield or La Crosse, each at least an hour away.\n\nShe first tried prescribing Kruchten gabapentin and then duloxetine, two non-opioid medicines. Neither helped enough. Eventually she prescribed the opioid hydrocodone, finally allowing him to sleep.\n\n\u201cWithout the sleep I was a couch potato,\u201d Kruchten said. \u201cOnce I started to get to sleep (at night), I got rid of my TV and the couch and started becoming more active.\u201d\n\nDoctor launches multi-pronged effort\n\nNecedah is not exactly at the center of the opioid epidemic, but it is not far from it either. The overdose death rate in Juneau County \u2014 home to Necedah \u2014 tracks with the state average, which itself is about average in the United States. But Juneau County shares a border with Adams County, home to one of the state\u2019s highest overdose death rates.\n\nWhen Gatzke-Plamann came to Necedah in 2010, U.S. opioid prescriptions were peaking. She estimates she inherited 25 to 30 patients with monthly opioid prescriptions. Soon she, like many peers around the country, noticed a rise in overdose and misuse.\n\nToday, Gatzke-Plamann\u2019s affiliated hospital sends her a monthly report of how many of her patients have opioid prescriptions. It varies each month, she said, but usually ranges from seven to 10. That is due to her efforts.\n\nAround 2012, she stopped taking on new patients using chronic opioid medications to focus on current opioid patients. She weaned many off opioids and tracked how many pills she prescribed. Instead of defaulting to a month\u2019s worth of pills for a C-section patient, for example, she might only prescribe three to five pills.\n\n\u201cMost of the time those patients really only have that much pain for a couple of days,\u201d Gatzke-Plamann said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to have those pain medications sitting in their medicine cabinets.\u201d\n\nGatzke-Plamann helped shape her community\u2019s wider discussion about opioids. That included joining the county\u2019s substance abuse prevention coalition and educating her peers.\n\nAgreements help opioid users\n\nAround 2016, Mile Bluff Medical Center \u2014 the hospital in Mauston with which she is affiliated \u2014 standardized a medication treatment agreement with patients, laying out rules for opioid prescriptions.\n\nPatients such as Michael Kruchten must agree to stipulations before getting a new prescription. That includes getting pills from only one doctor and filling prescriptions at just one pharmacy while also submitting to random pill counts and urine screenings. Kruchten is something of a model patient in that regard, according to Gatzke-Plamann.\n\n\u201cYou come in for appointments regularly and you\u2019re always on time and you\u2019re respectful with the staff,\u201d she told him as they reviewed the contract at an appointment in November.\n\nGatzke-Plamann can stop prescribing opioids to patients who violate the agreement. But the contracts aim to keep communication open rather than punish. Reviewing the contract with a patient allows them to revisit the risks and warning signs of addiction.\n\nOn his recent visit, Kruchten told the doctor he only took one hydrocodone pill instead of his usual two the previous night, saying it was \u201csatisfactory\u201d in curbing the pain.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s good that you don\u2019t take it to just put yourself to sleep,\u201d Gatzke-Plamann responded. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not a sleep medicine. You understand that. We\u2019ve talked about that one before.\u201d\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d Kruchten agreed.\n\nTreatment lacking in rural areas\n\nThe Friday call for help in 2016 made Gatzke-Plamann realize Necedah lacked a crucial tool for solving the pain puzzle: addiction treatment.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have as many resources here,\u201d Gatzke-Plamann said of Juneau County, one of the poorest and least healthy in the state. \u201cWhen I see that there\u2019s a need for something, it\u2019s on me to do something about that.\u201d\n\nShe said that is what happened with buprenorphine.\n\nExperts say buprenorphine effectively treats addiction, but the medicine is particularly scarce in rural communities. More than 10 million rural Americans \u2014 more than one-fifth of the country\u2019s rural population \u2014 live in counties without a single clinician licensed to prescribe the drug. (The rural-urban disparity in access has, however, shrunk since 2017.)\n\nIn Wisconsin, 18 of 72 counties lack a buprenorphine provider, and 14 of those unserved counties are rural.\n\nToday Gatzke-Plamann is one of only two people in Juneau County licensed to prescribe buprenorphine. The other is a physician\u2019s assistant she supervises. Catina Stoflet is among about 10 patients they treat in this expansion of a practice that Gatzke-Plamann considered \u201calready at capacity.\u201d\n\nStoflet, 35, got hooked on prescription opioids as a 16-year-old in 2001, during the first wave of the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic. She started getting kidney stones in high school. She has endured more than 200 of the painful obstructions by her count, leading to many surgeries to remove them.\n\nThat first prescription was for Tylenol 3, a combination of acetaminophen and the opioid codeine. Doctors soon escalated her to stronger drugs: vicodin, percocet, oxycodone.\n\n\u201cIt was right around the time that people didn\u2019t know what (opioids were) doing to you,\u201d Stoflet said.\n\nStoflet said she spent years in recovery beginning in 2007. But she relapsed in 2014, progressing to heroin and methamphetamine. This year she decided to quit for good. Stoflet said her primary care doctor introduced her to Gatzke-Plamann, who had recently begun prescribing buprenorphine.\n\nJust like Gatzke-Plamann\u2019s opioid patients, buprenorphine patients must sign contracts, including agreeing to participate in a treatment program.\n\nStoflet works with a counselor and community recovery specialist at the Roche-A-Cri Recovery Center in Friendship, Wisconsin, about 20 miles from Necedah. The center opened in September 2018. Without its additional resources, Gatzke-Plamann said she would not feel comfortable prescribing buprenorphine.\n\n\u201cI am just one part of their treatment plan,\u201d Gatzke-Plamann said. \u201cI prescribe the medication, but they need the counseling. They need the psycho-social support. They need the group meetings.\u201d\n\nStoflet lives about 30 miles from Roche-A-Cri and 40 miles from Gatzke-Plamann\u2019s clinic in Necedah. Even so, Stoflet said the long, frequent drives for recovery are worthwhile.\n\n\u2018It might be rocky\u2019\n\nAt an appointment in early November, Stoflet worried about an upcoming surgery that would require her to pause her buprenorphine treatment and return to opioids for pain. She talked through the angst with Gatzke-Plamann.\n\n\u201cWe would potentially take you off the buprenorphine and do short-acting pain medications around that time,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cThe trouble is then, after your acute pain episode from the surgery is no longer as significant \u2014 then we need you to stop those pain medicines for at least 24 hours. And then you can start up on your regular buprenorphine dose.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I will be able to go right to the regular dose,\u201d Stoflet said, \u201cand I should be fine?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Gatzke-Plamann reassured, adding, \u201cit might be rocky.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s going to be \u2014 it\u2019s no treat,\u201d Stoflet replied.\n\nStoflet did briefly use opioids after her late-November surgery. Then she returned to buprenorphine. December marks seven months of treatment.\n\nThe opioid epidemic is too complicated to boil down to grim statistics or the stories of one or two patients. But the crisis is real across Wisconsin and beyond, and Gatkze-Plamann confronts it every day.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine not doing it, because \u2014 then who would?\u201d\n\nThis story comes from a partnership of Wisconsin Watch, Wisconsin Public Radio and NPR.
