OnePlus has already updated their OnePlus 7 Pro to Android 10 back in September, but the T-Mobile locked variant of the phone lagged behind a bit. That update\u2019s finally starting to roll out.\n\nThat\u2019s unfortunately one of the drawbacks to buying a phone through a carrier, but at least the wait is over.\n\nThe update is the same that OnePlus pushed out a couple months ago, bumping the phone to Oxygen OS 10.0.1. That brings Android 10 and all of its new features, plus the November 2019 security patch and some other bug fixes. It\u2019s also thoroughly tested on T-Mobile\u2019s network, so it should be rock solid after this delay.\n\nIt clocks in at 2GB, so make sure you\u2019ve got some time to let the install happen. Good way to start off 2020.\n\nsource: reddit", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["OnePlus", "mediatek", "Android 12", "motorola", "OnePlus 7 Pro", "pixel 6", "accessories", "T-Mobile", "Wear OS", "Qualcomm", "Stadia", "Google", "lenovo", "Galaxy S22", "Android 10", "Oppo", "Chromebook"], "authors": ["Jared Peters"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Better late than never, right?
