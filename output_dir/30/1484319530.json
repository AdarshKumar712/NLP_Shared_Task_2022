Brent crude is expected to hover around US$63 a barrel, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday, down modestly from current levels, as Opec production cuts offset weaker demand.\n\nOver the past year, increased US output offset the supply reductions undertaken by Opec, led by Saudi Arabia and stemming from US sanctions on Venezuela and Iran. Lacklustre demand, including in developed economies, remains a primary concern this year.\n\n\"Oil prices, though largely expected to trade positive, will face headwinds from subdued global growth momentum and robust US shale output levels in the first quarter (of 2020),\" said Mr Benjamin Lu, an analyst at Phillip Futures.\n\nUS crude production in October rose to a record of 12.66 million barrels per day (bpd) from a revised 12.48 million bpd in September, according to a monthly report by the US government.\n\nThe pace of growth is expected to slow in 2020.\n\nBrent crude fell 67 US cents, or 1 per cent, to settle at US$66.00 a barrel. WTI crude in the United States fell 62 US cents, or 1 per cent, to settle at US$61.06 a barrel.\n\nOn Tuesday, trade volumes were low with many market participants away for year-end holidays, amplifying the market's moves.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said the phase 1 trade deal with China would be signed on Jan 15 at the White House.\n\nThe deal has boosted factories' output and Chinese manufacturing activity expanded for a second straight month.\n\nChina's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks economic trends in the manufacturing and service sectors, was unchanged at 50.2 in December from November, just above the 50-point mark separating growth from contraction.\n\nInvestors were nervous about the Middle East, where thousands of protesters and militia fighters gathered outside the US embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday and yesterday to condemn American air strikes against Iraqi militias.\n\nSecurity guards inside the embassy fired stun grenades at protesters. The US ambassador and staff were evacuated.\n\n\"Considering that Iraq is the second-largest Opec producer with production around 4.6 million barrels per day, market participants may add a risk premium to oil if tensions last for longer,\" UBS oil analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.\n\n\"That said, we need to see if the latest protests spread also in the south of the country, where most of the crude is exported.\"\n\nREUTERS", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["GLOBAL ECONOMY", "OIL PRICES/CRUDE OIL"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 05:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "NEW YORK \u2022 Oil prices fell 1 per cent on Tuesday, the last trading day of the decade, but notched the biggest annual gain in three years, backed by a thaw in the US-China trade war and ongoing supply cuts from major oil producers..
