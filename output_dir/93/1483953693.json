It marked the 13th attack on a Jewish person in New York City since Dec. 23.\n\nWitness Moses Weiser said it began with two women yelling slurs and when the victim called 911 they allegedly attacked him, using his own cellphone as a weapon.\n\n\u201cThey took him in, they threw him down to the ground and broke his phone and threw the phone to his head,\u201d Weiser said.\n\nWeiser said the victim flagged down police officers who caught up to the women at Rutledge Street and Broadway outside a discount store, which is across the street from the 90th Precinct station house.\n\nPolice said they expected to charge the women, ages 24 and 34.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s a shame,\u201d Weiser said.\n\nCONTINUING COVERAGE: New York Synagogue Attack\n\n\u201cWhey were obviously making fun of him cause he was Jewish and he was targeted cause he was Jewish,\u201d Jack hershkovich said.\n\nLess than a day earlier, Hershkovich says his 15-year-old son was riding the bus home from school in Gravesend Tuesday when he was robbed at knife point by two men.\n\n\u201cThey took the yarmulke off his head\u2026 took his ear pods off his ear\u2026 They pushed him, threatened him, but then they ended up getting off the bus.\u201d\n\nBoosted CrimeStoppers rewards, extra grant money for security and extra patrols haven\u2019t completely satisfied some residents. They say law enforcement\u2019s top priority should be catching all attackers.\n\nThere were at least 10 attacks against the Jewish community in New York last week. Two happened in Crown Heights and may have been committed by the same group, CBS2\u2019s Nick Caloway reported earlier Wednesday.\n\nPolice released videos of two recent attacks they believe may share the same group of suspects. The first shows a group approach then punch a 56-year-old Hasidic man in Crown Heights last Tuesday; knocking him to the ground. Minutes later and just blocks away, a group hits another Hasidic man over the head with a folded chair.\n\nRELATED STORY: ADL Offering $10,000 Reward To Help Fight Anti-Semitic Attacks In NYC\n\nAs the anti-Semitic violence continues to surge, the fear and disgust is growing.\n\nIn Crown Heights, the Guardian Angels have started patrolling the streets again; alongside the NYPD and state troopers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re starting to call the Guardian Angels as they did in 70s, 80s, and early 90s. We shouldn\u2019t have to go back to that period of time. We became such a better city and now we\u2019re beginning to slip back to the abyss,\u201d the group\u2019s founder, Curtis Sliwa said.\n\nThe volunteer safety patrols, in their red berets, are a sign of the times for many.\n\n\u201cSeeing the red jackets and hats and Curtis Sliwa reminded me of being here during the riots of \u201991,\u201d Rochel Bernstein said.\n\n\u201cTo come patrol this section and to prevent such outrage like the riots of 1991 then they\u2019re pure angels,\u201d Rabbi Hager added.\n\nWednesday morning, Gov. Cuomo toured Williamsburg and directed state police to add patrols in Jewish neighborhoods across the state.\n\nMayor de Blasio says additional NYPD strategic response officers will also be on the streets.\n\n\u201cThe mayor and governor they just come and give lip service. We want to see policies that will actually keep our neighborhood safe,\u201d Moshiach Now told CBS2\u2019s Ali Bauman.\n\nSome people in the Jewish community say as scary as these attacks are, it\u2019s more important than ever to remain vigilant.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["williamsburg anti-semitic attack", "crown heights anti-semitic attack", "crown heights antisemitism", "crown heights hasidic jew attack", "crown heights jewish attack", "crown heights", "brooklyn", "new york", "nick caloway", "local tv"], "tags": ["Nick Caloway", "New York", "New York Synagogue Attack", "Anti-Semitic Attack", "Crown Heights", "Antisemitism", "Local TV", "Dave Carlin", "Brooklyn"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Police are investigating more incidents of violence against Jews, including one that happened at around 1 p.m. on Wednesday along Broadway in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://newyork.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14578484/2019/07/cropped-newyork-favicon-512.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "williamsburg anti-semitic attack, crown heights anti-semitic attack, crown heights antisemitism, crown heights hasidic jew attack, crown heights jewish attack, crown heights, brooklyn, new york, nick caloway, local tv", "keywords": "williamsburg anti-semitic attack, crown heights anti-semitic attack, crown heights antisemitism, crown heights hasidic jew attack, crown heights jewish attack, crown heights, brooklyn, new york, nick caloway, local tv", "fb": {"app_id": 148100721870411, "pages": 13539254023}, "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msvalidate.01": "D7F1EA20F2703FD996C1C4687722394F", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"title": "13 And Counting: NYPD Probing New Year's Day Attack On Young Jewish Man In Williamsburg", "image": {"identifier": "https://newyork.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14578484/2020/01/crownheightsattack.jpg?w=1024", "secure_url": "https://newyork.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14578484/2020/01/crownheightsattack.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 576}, "description": "Police are investigating more incidents of violence against Jews, including one that happened at around 1 p.m. on Wednesday along Broadway in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.", "type": "article", "url": "https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/01/01/brooklyn-anti-semitic-hate-crimes-jewish-men-attacked-williamsburg-crown-heights/"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T21:00:49+00:00", "suggested-social-copy": "Police are investigating more incidents of violence against Jews, including one that happened at around 1 p.m. on Wednesday along Broadway in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://newyork.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14578484/2020/01/crownheightsattack.jpg?w=1024", "title": "13 And Counting: NYPD Probing New Year's Day Attack On Young Jewish Man In Williamsburg", "description": "Police are investigating more incidents of violence against Jews, including one that happened at around 1 p.m. on Wednesday along Broadway in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.", "site": "/CBSnewyork"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://newyork.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14578484/2019/07/cropped-newyork-favicon-512.png?w=270", "description": "Police are investigating more incidents of violence against Jews, including one that happened at around 1 p.m. on Wednesday along Broadway in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn."}, "canonical_link": "https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/01/01/brooklyn-anti-semitic-hate-crimes-jewish-men-attacked-williamsburg-crown-heights/"}
