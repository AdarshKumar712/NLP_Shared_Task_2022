The poem reads thus -- \"Lazim hai ke hum bhi dekhenge. Jab arz-e-Khuda ke kaabe se. Sab but uthwaye jayenge, Hum ahl-e-safa mardood-e-harm. Masnad pe bithaye jayenge. Sab taaj uchale jaenge. Sab takht giraye jayenge. Bas naam rahega Allah ka. Hum dekhenge.\"\n\nIt is the last two lines of the poem, which have raised hackles and were obviously misinterpreted -- \"When all idols will be removed, only Allah's name will remain.\"\n\nHere, it needs to be understood that Zia had tried to use conservative Islam as a tool of repression tool to tighten his tenacious stronghold over the country. In Hum Dekhenge, Faiz called out Zia \u2014 a worshipper of power and not a believer in Allah \u2014 using imagery of faith as well as Qayamat, the Day of Reckoning.\n\nThe panel was set up in response to complaints filed by a faculty member who claimed that the students, during a protest, sang this poem which was anti-Hindu.\n\nThe panel will also probe whether the students violated prohibitory orders clamped in the city on the day of the march, and whether they posted objectionable content on the social media and whether the Faiz poem is anti-Hindu.\n\nIt may be recalled that the IIT-Kanpur students had taken out a peaceful march on the campus on December 17 in support of the students of Jamia Millia Islamia and during the march, the students sang the Faiz poem.\n\nThe IIT faculty member, in his complaint, has alleged that the students made anti-India and communal statements during their demonstration in solidarity with the Jamia students.\n\nHe has further stated that \"organisers and masterminds must be identified and expelled immediately.\"\n\nFifteen other students have also signed the complaint filed by the professor against the protesting students.\n\nMeanwhile, IIT students have said that the faculty member who lodged the complaint has been banned on a social networking site for posting communal content.\n\nIn an article published on the IIT-Kanpur student media portal, the students clarified what exactly happened on the day of protest and how their chant was given a 'communal and misleading' turn. They stated that they had recited a few lines of the Faiz poem in reference to the police crackdown on the Jamia students.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["protest", "Right Wing", "Anthem", "faiz ahmad faiz"], "tags": ["Right Wing", "protest", "Anthem", "faiz ahmad faiz"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The renowned poet with Left leanings seems to have outraged Indian \u2018right wing\u2019 sensibilities too with his litany of protest, Hum Dekhenge", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "protest,Right Wing,Anthem,faiz ahmad faiz", "description": "The renowned poet with Left leanings seems to have outraged Indian \u2018right wing\u2019 sensibilities too with his litany of protest, Hum Dekhenge", "title": "Poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz's protest anthem rattles right-wing", "keywords": "protest,Right Wing,Anthem,faiz ahmad faiz", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/poet-faiz-ahmad-faizs-protest-anthem-rattles-right-wing", "title": "Poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz's protest anthem rattles right-wing", "image": {"identifier": "https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2020-01%2Feabedad6-b252-4146-87f2-9175691b83cc%2FPoet_Faiz.jpg?rect=0%2C82%2C600%2C315&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "site_name": "Latest Indian news, Top Breaking headlines, Today Headlines, Top Stories at Free Press Journal"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz's protest anthem rattles right-wing", "image": "https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2020-01%2Feabedad6-b252-4146-87f2-9175691b83cc%2FPoet_Faiz.jpg?rect=0%2C70%2C600%2C338&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true", "creator": "FP News Service", "site": "Latest Indian news, Top Breaking headlines, Today Headlines, Top Stories at Free Press Journal", "domain": "https://www.freepressjournal.in"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2254637581419855, "pages": 178566438825717}, "viewport": "width=device-width,height=device-height,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=2.0,minimum-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/poet-faiz-ahmad-faizs-protest-anthem-rattles-right-wing"}
