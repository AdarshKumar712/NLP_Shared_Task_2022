The kid needs cash fast.\n\nThat\u2019s old news. I\u2019ve written about this a lot.\n\nBut here\u2019s a frightening new twist on this standard swindle that you ought to know about. So pay attention, especially if you are a concerned relative, a bank teller or, especially, a New York City doorman.\n\nUnder the time-honored scenario, a crook commands his target to go to the nearest electronics outlet or department store and buy gift cards, usually for around $10,000. Then, he has the victim read off the serial numbers on the card over the phone.\n\nNo muss, no fuss, no danger.\n\nThe new variation is far more frightening: The crook, or his agent, comes to a person\u2019s house or apartment building to collect the ransom in cash.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to a woman I\u2019ll call Cecilia, an 88-year-old who lives on the Upper East Side with her daughter and family. I\u2019m changing some details so the people can\u2019t be recognized or unduly harassed.\n\nCecilia\u2019s daughter told me the story in phone conversations and emails. \u201cMy mother received a call from someone impersonating my son, saying he was in an accident and in jail,\u201d she says.\n\nSo far, standard.\n\nsee also Scammers are out to screw your grandma Grandmas and grandpas don\u2019t usually spend thousands of dollars on...\n\n\u201cThis person got on the phone saying he was a lawyer and she needed to give cash to get her grandson out of jail,\u201d she continued.\n\nHe wanted cash. No gift cards for this crook.\n\nCecilia went to the Bank of America branch on East 86th Street and Lexington Avenue and withdrew $9,500. She was told by the crook that someone would come for the money.\n\nThat\u2019s the new variation. In the past, victims would be out money \u2014 but at least they weren\u2019t in any physical danger.\n\n\u201cThey came to our building,\u201d the daughter says, \u201cand the doorman told her she had a visitor who didn\u2019t want to go upstairs. She came downstairs and gave the man the money.\u201d\n\nThe doorman later told the daughter that Cecilia was upset and \u201cin a daze. He tried to help, but my mother said she was OK.\u201d\n\nCecilia was acting strange at the bank as well and the workers at Bank of America offered her a glass of water to calm her down.\n\nThe family did get a notification of a large withdrawal from the account \u2014 but it was too late to stop the transaction.\n\n\u201cMy husband handles my mom\u2019s finances and got a withdrawal alert and called me to ask why Mom took out a lot of money,\u201d said the daughter. \u201cI had called her and she kept saying, \u2018I will tell you when I get home.\u2019 So I rushed home. If I got there five minutes earlier, I could have stopped it.\u201d\n\nOr gotten hurt in a physical altercation with the person picking up the cash.\n\nPolice believe the call from the scammer came from Canada. They are pretty sure that someone else picks up the money. \u201cThey are always third parties picking it up,\u201d said a detective working the case.\n\nThe whole thing was caught on street cameras, and police have a warrant out for the suspect.\n\nAlarmingly, Cecilia isn\u2019t the only one who is being scammed in this way.\n\n\u201cWe have cases like this throughout the city. It\u2019s not unusual anymore,\u201d the detective said, adding that the police are working with the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office to solve the crime.\n\nsee also Be careful of this PayPal scam There are scams aplenty out there on the internet, and...\n\nAccording to the daughter, the person who picked up the money \u201cwas clean cut. No facial hairs or body tattoos\u201d that could be seen.\n\nThe police told the daughter that sometimes the people picking up the money \u201cdon\u2019t know what they were hired to do.\u201d\n\nI contacted Bank of America when I heard about this incident a few weeks ago, but I didn\u2019t get a response.\n\nNor did Cecilia\u2019s family hear from the bank, according to the daughter.\n\nIn case you think this is an instance of a feeble-minded individual being outsmarted, the daughter has this to say: \u201cMy mom\u2019s very savvy. She hangs up on telemarketers.\u201d\n\nBut now Cecilia doesn\u2019t even answer the phone.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been taken by a scam like this, call the cops. And if you haven\u2019t \u2014 yet \u2014 maybe this will make you a little more careful and suspicious of phone calls like the one Cecilia got. Just ignore the stranger\u2019s plea and hang up.\n\nHere\u2019s something to remember in 2020 that you might have forgotten: The stock market doesn\u2019t always go up, like it did last year.\n\nThink about the swoon that happened after December 2018, when the Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.\n\nAnd think about what will happen if the next decade is one in which high inflation is the prevailing theme and interest rates need to go much higher.\n\nSince this column is such a downer, let me finish by saying Happy New Year and good health to you in 2020!", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Business", "fraud", "scams"], "tags": ["fraud", "scams"], "authors": ["John Crudele", "January"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "There\u2019s a frightening new twist on a standard scam that you ought to know about.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/nypost-2016/static/images/apple-icons/nypost/apple-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
