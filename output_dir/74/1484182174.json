Will Thomas, 11, gets some air.\n\nThere was meant to be light by summer, but one of New Plymouth's busiest skateparks will have to wait until March.\n\nThe long-running $160,000 project to get lights installed at East End Skatepark, a stone's throw from the Coastal Walkway and the beach, was meant to be completed by this summer but has taken time to get off the ground.\n\nCouncillor Stacey Hitchcock said the main goal was to have the lights in for daylight saving.\n\nSupplied The lights are planned for installation in March 2020.\n\nThe project had been driven by the skateboarding fraternity itself, she said.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* East End Skate Park to finally get its lights\n\n* Annual plan and fee increases discussed at meeting\n\n* Skaters get shady sails cut from park revamp designs\n\n\"It came from the skaters; they were really excited about it.\"\n\nSIMON O'CONNOR/STUFF The project was driven by the skateboarders themselves, councillor Stacey Hitchcock said.\n\nThe lights will be activated by a button, which will turn them on until they slowly fade off after an hour. They will also shut off automatically by 9.30pm during the week, and 10pm on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n\nNew Plymouth District Council external relations manager Jacqueline Baker said in an emailed statement they are aiming to start construction in March, subject to contractor availability and technical challenges.\n\n\"We've been working closely with the Taranaki Skateboarding Association (TSA) throughout this process and they understand that there's been a small delay while we've secured all the funding.\"\n\nSIMON O'CONNOR/STUFF The lights were supposed to be in by the summer.\n\nCommittee chairman Glenn Jeffrey, who also works part-time for the Taranaki Daily News, said there was \"absolutely\" a demand for the lights.\n\n\"It was always going to be for those winter periods where it's dark at five o'clock and kids have finished their homework, and rather than sitting in front of the idiot box they can come down here and do their sport.\"\n\nThere had been some pushback from neighbours, but under the District Plan light rules they did not need to consult on the work, and the light spill would be minimum, Jeffery said.\n\nThey will also be seeking community funding to progress the later stages of the revamping project, such as a small area for kids who are learning and resurfacing the concrete.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Christina Persico"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "There was meant to be light by summer, but one of New Plymouth's busiest skateparks\u00a0will not get its lights until March.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/sics-assets/images/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "noarchive", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "fb": {"app_id": 207633159308175, "pages": 21253884267}, "verify-v1": "RazNiYjuvNuEsMeFXxfR9l9cDZIKxcq2VjQZA25CHgM=", "msapplication-config": "/sics-assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "There was meant to be light by summer, but one of New Plymouth's busiest skateparks&nbsp;will not get its lights until March.", "source": "Stuff", "og": {"description": "There was meant to be light by summer, but one of New Plymouth's busiest skateparks&nbsp;will not get its lights until March.", "title": "East End skatepark lights should be in by daylight saving", "url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/118511798/east-end-skatepark-lights-should-be-in-by-daylight-saving", "type": "article", "image": "https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/y/k/6/o/c/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1yk4ae.png/1577751495152.jpg", "keywords": "have, BEACH, RUNNING, one, Coastal, COUNCILLOR, New, Project, SUMMER, Skatepark, daylight, East End, March, NEW PLYMOUTH, keep, WINTER, Taranaki Daily News, Taranaki, COUNCIL, Clock, News, District Plan, This, SKATEBOARDING, Scooter, more, Who, PARK, Manager, CHAIRMAN, Community, SPORT, MEETING, Construction, Contractor, Daily, Revamp, Rules, Come, FUNDING, DISTRICT COUNCIL, Spill, WORK, delay, week", "site_name": "Stuff"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/118511798/east-end-skatepark-lights-should-be-in-by-daylight-saving"}
