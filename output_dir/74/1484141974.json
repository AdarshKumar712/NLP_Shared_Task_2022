Bipin Rawat, on Wednesday said the armed forces stay away from politics and work as per the directives of the government of the day, remarks that come amid allegations that the forces were being politicised.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former Army Chief took charge as the first Chief of Defence Staff today and said his task is to create synergy between different wings of the armed forces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We keep ourselves away from politics. We act according to the directives of the government of the day,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Rawat said his focus will be to ensure the best and optimal use of resources allocated to the three services.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Bipin Rawat was named as India's first Chief of Defence Staff a day before he was to retire from services after completing a full three-year term as the Chief of Army Staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nDays before the government announced its decision to appoint him as the CDS, General Rawat was surrounded in controversy, owing to his comment on the ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. He had criticised the people leading violent protests against the new legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cabinet Committee on Security had, in a landmark decision last week, approved the creation of the CDS who will act as the principal military adviser to the defence minister on all matters relating to tri-services.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommendation for the CDS had first been made after the Kargil War. It was argued that this post will create better coordination between the three services -- the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["chief of the defence staff", "general bipin rawat", "army chief", "politics", ""], "tags": [], "authors": ["News"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "newly-appointed chief of the defence staff, general bipin rawat, on wednesday said the armed forces stay away from politics and work as per the directives of th", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.etemaadweekly.com/images/logoicon.png", "meta_data": {"language": "english", "author": "news and media", "robots": "index,follow", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "description": "newly-appointed chief of the defence staff, general bipin rawat, on wednesday said the armed forces stay away from politics and work as per the directives of th", "keywords": "chief of the defence staff, general bipin rawat, army chief, politics,", "og": {"type": "website", "url": "https://www.en.etemaaddaily.com/world/national/we-stay-away-from-politics-says-cds-gen-bipin-rawat:69160", "title": "We stay away from politics, says CDS Gen Bipin Rawat", "description": "Newly-appointed Chief of the Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, on Wednesday said the armed forces", "image": "https://www.en.etemaaddaily.com/pages/world/national/70698.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@EtemaadDaily", "title": "We stay away from politics, says CDS Gen Bipin Rawat", "description": "Newly-appointed Chief of the Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, on Wednesday said the armed forces", "image": "https://www.en.etemaaddaily.com/pages/world/national/70698.jpg", "domain": "https://www.en.etemaaddaily.com/"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.en.etemaaddaily.com/world/national/we-stay-away-from-politics-says-cds-gen-bipin-rawat:69160"}
