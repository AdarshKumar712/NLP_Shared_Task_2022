Gerry Connolly said, \u201cI would call upon the president to re-examine both his rhetoric and his policies with respect to Iran. Much of this friction and violence flows from his very fateful decision to renounce and walk away from our own agreement that was working, the Iran nuclear agreement. Thus severing any working relationship we possibly could have with Iran. And Iran now has very little to lose in the relationship. That puts it in a very dangerous position.\u201d\n\nFeatured image credit: Cliff \u2013 flickr.com/photos/nostri-imago/5098785388\n\nthegatewaypundit.com/2020/01/sick-democrat-lawmaker-blames-president-trump-after-iranian-proxy-groups-attack-us-embassy-in-baghdad/", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.teaparty.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Favicon-Tea-Party.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "google-site-verification": "BUmroTlpSK6UfDeL-RF65T8u9-kL5ZhBtj6sufpwNGY"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.teaparty.org/sick-democrat-lawmaker-blames-president-trump-after-iranian-proxy-groups-attack-us-embassy-in-baghdad-423072/"}
