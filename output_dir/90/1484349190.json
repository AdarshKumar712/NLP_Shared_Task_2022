I mean, when you\u2019ve been writing 19 for quite a few years \u2014 a decade, I guess \u2014 jotting \u201c20\u201d is going to take some getting used to.\n\nYou were ushered in Wednesday night, deservedly so, as you assume your role in the next dozen months, etching yourself in history.\n\nSo much for the obligatory small talk. Let\u2019s get to work.\n\nYou undoubtedly recognize the challenges and issues we all collectively are facing.\n\nMaybe the festive environment suggests our first should be, alas, light-hearted. Fun. New Year\u2019s resolutions that, mysteriously, fade away in early January.\n\nI might not be doing my job if we chuckled and laughed ourselves into your year of reign.\n\nThese are tough \u2014 even uncomfortable \u2014 topics. But, if we start the discussion now, when we gather a year from now, we can look in the rearview mirror and celebrate how we create new ways of doing things.\n\nSo: buckle up.\n\nFinancial stablity is obviously a concern. An introduction of a carbon tax in Albertan, working out to roughly four cents per litre at the pump, will change how we do things, especially in motor vehicle transportation.\n\nPlease forgive the pun: we haven\u2019t been down that road before.\n\nNot only for professional drivers. But young families, like our son and his three sons who love driving to look at trains, may think long and hard before buckling up.\n\nIt\u2019s change. And we all struggle with change, don\u2019t we?\n\nPlease be gentle with us as we navigate through the new carbon tax.\n\nThere are more topics. I am sure you know about them, so please consider this as a friendly reminder.\n\nI could spew hundreds \u2014 even thousands \u2014 of words on political leaders who seem to be fixated on raising their own personal agendas, and egos, on social media and media availability.\n\nOne has to seriously ponder what could be accomplished if those comments \u2014 and more importantly, energy \u2014 addressed social issues.\n\nI also think we should look at how we can encourage, support and embrace our most precious future commodity: our youth.\n\nA television news story just rolled out about school bus fees going up in February. School boards are making decisions that, honestly, could shape the futures of kids in ways that could be detrimental.\n\nLast year, Tom Hanks played the part of the most lovable Fred Rogers in a feature film. We all knew him wearing those knitted, colourful sweaters in a television series for kids and impacted countless kids in even more countless ways.\n\nWe need to find another Fred Rogers who can gently relate to kids in a way they can be entertained but learn lessons, that, yes: they can do whatever they dream. And we will be there to turn those dreams into 4K reality.\n\nSo, 2020 \u2014 that\u2019s how I see things.\n\nI am confident you can make things turn out just fine. Because \u2026 you have time on your side.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\n\u2014Cam", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Video"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 02:19:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Dear 2020:Man, that\u2019s different.
