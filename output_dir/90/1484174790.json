It planned to hold Mass praesente cadavere to give those who wished to pay him their last respects the opportunity to do so. Details will be given at a later stage.\n\nThe Order said that in the past days it received several messages of condolences including from Pope Francis and the Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin.\n\nIt thanked those who expressed regret at the news of Cardinal Grech's death while acknowledging his qualities and priceless heritage he left in several sectors.
