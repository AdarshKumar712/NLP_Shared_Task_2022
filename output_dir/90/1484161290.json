Sometimes it\u2019s boring. Other times, it turns into a day for the ages.\n\nThankfully, more than enough days of brilliance, poignance and humor emerged to justify the existence of this piece: My top Datelines of the Decade.\n\n10. Baltimore Hyatt Regency, Aug. 14, 2014. Bud Selig\u2019s final big play, in over 22 years as commissioner, went as many that preceded it: Messy, yet ultimately successful. Bud, a spry 80 years old by the time he convened his owners to this resilient city\u2019s Inner Harbor, badly wanted his second-in-command Rob Manfred to succeed him. Manfred entered the meetings with majority support, yet a vote of this gravity required 75 percent of the 30 owners to be in agreement, and Selig, for all his lobbying, schmoozing and horse-trading, did not start the day with the necessary 23 votes for Manfred, as his old pal Jerry Reinsdorf of the White Sox led the effort for Red Sox bigwig Tom Werner to get the gig. It took six votes over about seven hours \u2014 and the image of a frustrated Selig executing his trademark shrug to amused reporters as he entered a glass elevator amidst the craziness \u2014 to finally get to the finish line with Manfred, who hasn\u2019t been shy about trying to speed up the game with serious changes to the on-field product. Whereas this change in power carried more than a tinge of comedy, only sadness loomed on Nov. 24, 2013, when a funeral was held for beloved Players Association executive director Michael Weiner. Brain cancer took Weiner at age 51, and tensions between the union (now led by Tony Clark) and Major League Baseball have intensified dramatically since, calling into question whether a work stoppage can be avoided when this collective bargaining agreement expires in 2021.\n\n9. Yankee Stadium, Oct. 17, 2017. These Yankees, having missed the playoffs in three of the prior four seasons (and advancing only as far as a lost American League wild-card game in the other one, 2015), were supposed to use 2017 to grow their Baby Bombers. If they qualified for the postseason, then it would be a bonus. What a bonus it turned out to be. After outlasting the Twins (of course) in the wild-card game, they mounted a remarkable comeback to defeat the top-seeded Indians in the AL Division Series, Didi Gregorius having himself a clinching Game 5 to remember, and then they further planted their flag with a memorable seven-game ALCS loss to the Astros. Game 4 of that series, in The Bronx, saw the home team, down 4-0, score two runs in the seventh and four runs in the eighth. When Gary Sanchez slammed a tiebreaking, two-run double in the eighth, the new Stadium roared as we hadn\u2019t seen or heard it to that point. The crowd loved this home-built group. Alas, this moment doesn\u2019t rank higher because the Yankees \u2014 and, notably, Sanchez \u2014 have yet to build sufficiently on that moment, as baseball\u2019s most decorated franchise clocked the entire decade without sniffing a Fall Classic.\n\n8. Busch Stadium, Oct. 27, 2011. Any World Series contest that evokes both 1986 Game 6 and 1991 Game 6 has plenty going for it, and so it was on this chilly Midwestern night. Just like \u201886 Game 6 at Shea Stadium, the Cardinals found themselves down to their last strike \u2014 twice. Just like those Mets, St. Louis never said die, with David Freese slamming a game-tying, two-run, two-out triple off Rangers closer Neftali Feliz in the ninth and Lance Berkman drilling a game-tying, one-run, two-out single off Scott Feldman in the 10th. And when Freese slammed a walk-off homer against Mark Lowe in the 11th, Fox broadcaster Joe Buck declared, \u201cWe will see you tomorrow night\u201d for a necessary Game 7, just as Buck\u2019s legendary father Jack had said 20 years prior when Kirby Puckett\u2019s walk-off blast against the Braves kept the Twins alive. Awesome stuff. This, too, would rank even higher if the Cardinals\u2019 victory in the finale hadn\u2019t felt so anticlimactic, or if \u2014 New York bias alert \u2014 the story resonated more locally.\n\n7. London Stadium, June 29, 2019. Yes, the sluggers\u2019 duel between the Yankees and Red Sox was beyond exhausting, and sure, there were some logistical obstacles to overcome. But come on, folks. Yankees-Red Sox in London? I don\u2019t understand how you could be there, as I was fortunate enough to be, and not be inspired by the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm, be they natives, expats or tourists. Even if this turns out to be more of a historical oddity than the start of something huge \u2014 the Cubs and Cardinals will face each other in London next season, with nothing set beyond that \u2014 it was something special and memorable to take the game into Europe\n\n6. Kauffman Stadium, Oct. 29, 2014. You could have earned some serious money if, a decade ago, you had wagered that the Giants would win the most titles of anyone from 2010 through 2019. What a spectacular if odd run \u2014 three championships in five years, missing the playoffs altogether the other two years \u2014 for these guys, and it culminated with Game 7 of the \u201814 Series against the Royals, who advanced this far thanks in large part to the best wild-card game since the do-or-die contest\u2019s inception. Kansas City fell just short \u2014 90 feet, to be precise \u2014 thanks to Madison Bumgarner\u2019s five shutout innings of relief just three days after he authored a complete-game masterpiece. It was an all-time performance by the lefty Bumgarner, who put together a 2.11 ERA for the decade in 16 postseason games as he built a brand as baseball\u2019s most clutch pitcher of his era.\n\n5. Citi Field, Sept. 29, 2018. The baseball schedule/calendar gods kept me away from Mariano Rivera\u2019s and Derek Jeter\u2019s last performances at Yankee Stadium, just in case you\u2019re wondering why they didn\u2019t make the cut. On this night in Queens, however, I witnessed something quite different: A salute to David Wright, but also a lamentation of what could have been. The Mets captain started his first game in over two years, his career and Hall of Fame trajectory sadly cut short by spinal stenosis. Medically, Wright shouldn\u2019t have been out there at all. Emotionally? He needed to log one more shift, even a half-shift, at third base. And the fans, who filled up the ballpark for what was otherwise a meaningless, final-weekend game against the Marlins, acted as though they needed it, too, showering Wright with love and appreciation for all he had done for the franchise.\n\n4. Fenway Park, Aug. 18, 2013. If the tabloid newspaper, relying on bombastic front and back pages for sales, didn\u2019t exist prior to 2004, someone would have invented them at that point \u2014 just to keep up with Alex Rodriguez\u2019s hijinks and accomplishments, often in that order. Bless A-Rod, who sent me on the assignment of a lifetime in \u201813 when he went to war with MLB and the Yankees \u2014 over a 211-game suspension for using illegal performance-enhancing drugs and obstructing baseball\u2019s investigation \u2014 while playing major-league baseball for the Yankees. The saga featured so much drama both on and off the field, and the most memorable chapter featured both, at Fenway naturally. Before the game, Yankees general manager Brian Cashman torched A-Rod in a conversation with reporters, saying that he wouldn\u2019t say anything beyond hello and goodbye to his third baseman due to the \u201clitigious environment.\u201d That was a huge story\u2026until the game started, and Red Sox starting pitcher Ryan Dempster decided that he was going to personally discipline A-Rod by drilling him \u2014 at which point the Yankees, who had been exhausted by their teammate\u2019s drama, came to his defense. For good measure, naturally, A-Rod later went deep off Dempster. That A-Rod is now a respected national baseball broadcaster engaged to Jennifer Lopez, well, again\u2026the man is made for tabloids.\n\n3. Dodger Stadium, Oct. 15, 2015. Twenty teams advanced to the World Series this decade, and only one spot was claimed by a New York representative. What a run by those 2015 Mets, from the slow start to the July trades to Wilmer Flores\u2019 walk-off homer two days after he thought he was traded to their improbable sweep of the Cubs in the National League Championship Series. That sweep, you could argue rather easily, emanated naturally from the Mets\u2019 best game of the season, their thrilling, 3-2 elimination of the Dodgers in NLDS Game 5 at Chavez Ravine. What a game, from Daniel Murphy\u2019s continuing heroics to Jacob deGrom\u2019s gutty, six-inning effort to Terry Collins\u2019 turning to Noah Syndergaard for the seventh and then Jeurys Familia for a six-out save. If you couldn\u2019t get into this one, then you\u2019re probably not meant for baseball. And while the Mets serve as anything besides a model of consistency, that makes their peaks all the more exciting, doesn\u2019t it?\n\n2. Citizens Bank Park, May 1, 2011. Sunday night baseball, early in the season, and the Mets, at 11-16, were heading nowhere besides a Madoff-fueled rebuild whereas the Phillies, at 17-9, were en route to their fourth straight NL East title. None of that mattered late in the game when some rather non-baseball news broke: A team of U.S. special forces had tracked down and killed Osama bin Laden. So as Murphy hit against Ryan Madson in the top of the ninth inning, chants of \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d filled the ballpark. It was a collective, emotional flashback to the horrors of 9-11 nearly a decade earlier, an impromptu opportunity to mourn again those we lost that day and feel at least some measure of justice. What a powerful moment to share among tens of thousands of people.\n\n1. Progressive Field, Nov. 2, 2016. The best World Series are those won by teams to end long droughts, or to capture a title for the very first time. This decade brought us the Giants\u2019 first parades since 1954 (and their first-ever since moving to San Francisco in 1958), the Astros\u2019 initial championship in 56 years of existence and the Nationals\u2019 first triumph in 51 years as a franchise as well as Washington\u2019s first such celebration since 1924. All, of course, pale in comparison to the Cubs, who played 107 consecutive seasons without winning it all until it finally ended on this unseasonably warm night in Cleveland. It fit the woebegone narrative that the Cubs needed to climb out of a 3-1 hole, winning the last two on the road, and that their closer for hire Aroldis Chapman, exhausted, gave up a game-tying, two-run homer to Rajai Davis in the eighth inning. The rain delay following the ninth inning added a supernatural element. And when the Cubs actually prevailed in the 10th inning, in front of a crowd that clearly featured more Cubs fans than Indians fans despite the location, it sparked a celebration for the ages. Think of all the Cubs fans who lived long without experiencing this. Surely, many of their descendants did. The Indians, meanwhile, move into the 2020s as baseball\u2019s longest-suffering franchise, championship-free since 1948.\n\nLet\u2019s catch up on Pop Quiz questions:\n\nFrom Soumitra Eachempati of Manhattan: Name the former Dodgers first baseman-outfielder who appears as himself in a 1970 episode of \u201cThe Brady Bunch.\u201d\n\nFrom Michael Gee of New York City: Now in the Hall of Fame, this pitcher appeared as himself in a 1968 episode of \u201cGentle Ben.\u201d Name him.\n\nIf you have a young adult who\u2019s interested in baseball, I highly recommend \u201cA High Five for Glenn Burke\u201d by Phil Bildner, a terrific fictional story invoking the outfielder from the 1970s who wound up being a trailblazer. Actually, it\u2019s a good book for old adults, too.\n\nYour Pop Quiz answers:\n\nWes Parker.\n\nBob Gibson\n\nIf you have a tidbit that connects baseball with popular culture, please send it to me at kdavidoff@nypost.com.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Baseball", "alex rodriguez", "chicago cubs", "david wright", "madison bumgarner", "mlb", "new york mets", "new york yankees", "rob manfred"], "tags": ["mlb", "david wright", "new york yankees", "alex rodriguez", "madison bumgarner", "new york mets", "rob manfred", "chicago cubs"], "authors": ["Ken Davidoff", "January"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The New York Post's Ken Davidoff looks back at the 10 best baseball moments he has witnessed in-person over the last decade.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/nypost-2016/static/images/apple-icons/nypost/apple-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
