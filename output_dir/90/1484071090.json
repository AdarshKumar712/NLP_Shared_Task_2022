(Darryl Dyck/AP)\n\nKelly Fraser, a Canadian pop artist who gained attention for an Inuit-language cover of Rihanna\u2019s \u201cDiamonds,\u201d part of her advocacy efforts for her indigenous culture, died Dec. 24 in Winnipeg. She was 26.\n\nHer family issued a statement saying the cause was suicide, adding that \u201cKelly suffered from PTSD for many years as a result of childhood traumas, racism and persistent cyberbullying.\u201d\n\nMs. Fraser, who grew up in Sanikiluaq, Nunavut, and was living in Winnipeg, released \u201cIsuma,\u201d her debut album, in 2014. Her sophomore album, \u201cSedna,\u201d came out in 2017 and was nominated for indigenous music album of the year at Canada\u2019s Juno music awards.\n\nWhen Ms. Fraser wrote or translated songs into Inuktitut, an Inuit language, a key aim was to \u201cuse pop music as a platform to strengthen her language,\u201d said her producer, Thor Simonsen. She also wanted to make the music as accessible to as many people as possible, he said, so she mixed English and Inuktitut in her recordings and blended traditional Inuit sounds and themes with contemporary pop.\n\nA video of her version of \u201cDiamonds\u201d was widely viewed online.\n\nMs. Fraser was \u201cextremely passionate about trying to improve conditions for Inuit people\u201d as well, and wanted to help young people understand the history that contributed to their difficulties, Simonsen said.\n\nIn a 2017 statement that accompanied the release of \u201cSedna,\u201d Ms. Fraser said the album\u2019s goal was to heal those suffering from the results of colonization, including the \u201cdamaging effects of residential school and forced relocation. There is a great need for Inuit artists to directly speak to those affected from the past.\u201d\n\nShe was working on a third album, \u201cDecolonize,\u201d at the time of her death, Simonsen said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["", "inuit", "simonsen", "inuktitut", "sedna", "canadian"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Associated Press", "January At Pm"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "She mixed English and Inuktitut in her recordings and blended traditional Inuit sounds and themes with contemporary pop.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"object-hash": 1577900654, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "keywords": ", inuit, simonsen, inuktitut, sedna, canadian", "news_keywords": ", inuit, simonsen, inuktitut, sedna, canadian", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/kelly-fraser-canadian-singer-who-had-hit-with-inuit-language-diamonds-dies-at-26/2020/01/01/b0f4e250-2cb9-11ea-bcb3-ac6482c4a92f_story.html", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1lG2LoLofOxQcDwz6Be_hAcsNKg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R3NYYWBMXMI6VPFTVRSIFRFJF4.jpg", "title": "Kelly Fraser, Canadian singer who had hit with Inuit-language \u2018Diamonds,\u2019 dies at 26", "description": "She mixed English and Inuktitut in her recordings and blended traditional Inuit sounds and themes with contemporary pop."}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"app_id": 41245586762, "admins": 500835072}, "ansId": "WD2OEUBMXEI6VPFTVRSIFRFJF4", "ansVersion": "0.10.4", "description": "She mixed English and Inuktitut in her recordings and blended traditional Inuit sounds and themes with contemporary pop.", "robots": "index,follow", "theme": "normal"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/kelly-fraser-canadian-singer-who-had-hit-with-inuit-language-diamonds-dies-at-26/2020/01/01/b0f4e250-2cb9-11ea-bcb3-ac6482c4a92f_story.html"}
