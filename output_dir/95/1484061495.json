Of Neil Armstrong taking \u2018a small step for man and a giant leap for mankind \u2013 and, indeed, for womankind.\u2019 She observed that it is a reminder to us all that giant leaps often start with small steps, going on to speak of the continuing need for peace and reconciliation in our world and how this generally begins with small steps.\n\nIt was a very timely message. One of the things I have been reflecting upon since hearing it is how we can only take such steps ourselves. Watching my children take their first steps was a joyous experience precisely because I couldn\u2019t do it for them. First steps towards peace and reconciliation can be equally exhilarating to observe, but we cannot take them on behalf of others. We can only take them ourselves.\n\nThe Queen spoke \u2018of what positive things can be achieved when people set aside past differences and come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation. And, as we all look forward to the start of a new decade, it\u2019s worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change.\u2019\n\nThere has been much talk of deep division in our country since the Referendum. It strikes me that we actually have much more in common than anything that might divide us and that if we can all take some small steps of reconciliation we shall come together in exciting and unforeseen ways.\n\nMay this New Year bring you many blessings and may you share them with others.\n\nBishop John.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Worcester City Council", "Worcester Wolves", "Bbl", "Crime", "Entertainment", "West Mercia Police", "Aviva Premiership", "The Swan Theatre", "Cricket", "Severn Stars", "Worcester", "Huntingdon Hall", "Football", "Worcester City", "Worcester Warriors", "Worcestershire CCC", "Swan Theatre", "University Of Worcester", "Sixways", "Rugby"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://worcesterobserver.co.uk/wp-content/themes/newspaperv3/dist/img/favicons/worcester/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#2C3E50", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://worcesterobserver.co.uk/news/the-bishop-of-worcesters-new-year-message-2020/", "type": "article", "title": "The Bishop of Worcester\u2019s New Year Message 2020", "description": "THE QUEEN began her Christmas message by referring to the 50th anniversary of humanity\u2019s memorable first steps on the moon.
