The Merc with a Mouth, played by Ryan Reynolds, will get a third film and (possibly) an all-new universe to play in as Deadpool 3 is currently in development at Marvel Studios. The movie is an incredibly exciting development for both comic and movie fans. So, which villains from the comics should Wade Wilson take on in the third film?\n\nDeadpool landing in the MCU is still somewhat surprising. The R-rated hero was one of the few Marvel characters acquired in the Fox-Disney merger that will seemingly survive without major changes or being recast - which isn't all that surprising considering the reception for Reynolds in the role and the box office returns of the first two Deadpool films. Deadpool's popularity kept the franchise alive. Joining the MCU means Deadpool's villain roster will significantly expand. Here are five villains who could appear in Deadpool 3.\n\nRelated: Deadpool 2\u2019s Zazie Beetz Expects to Play Domino Again in Future Marvel Film\n\nDaken\n\nWhile it would be fantastic to see Reynold's Deadpool take on Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and see their feud/bromance further explored, the ship seems to have long sailed on that possibility following Wolvie's perfect end in Logan. So, if they can't do Wolverine, they might as well do the next best thing: Daken.\n\nDaken is the son of Wolverine and Itsu. He's got similar abilities to his pops, including retractable claws, an accelerated healing factor, and superhuman physical attributes. Deadpool would surely be disappointed to see Logan's son and not Wolverine himself as his main adversary. There's tons of potential for comedy and action with Daken taking on Deadpool. Although, if Marvel wanted to do a new version of Wolverine, introducing Daken would probably create more questions than answers.\n\nRelated: Deadpool 3: 10 Ways To Set It In The MCU\n\nEvil Deadpool\n\nEvil Deadpool might seem like a gimmick villain at first glance, but he's the Frankenstein's monster of the Deadpool universe.\n\nIn the comics, when Deadpool is institutionalized, he's treated by Dr. Ella Whitby, who soon falls in love with him. The feelings aren't reciprocated which is probably for the best after Wade discovers Whitby had been collecting his body parts in her freezer from the hero's various battles. So, how does Evil Deadpool come into all of this? Well, after Deadpool discovers her body parts in the freezer, he throws them into a dumpster. In the trash, Deadpool's healing factor fused each part into a new being: Evil Deadpool.\n\nA scientific freakshow, Evil Deadpool's body is completely mismatched. He's got two right arms and is able to maneuver his body in unusual, disgusting ways. Deadpool hunting down himself could be played comedically or somewhat tragically. Wade Wilson trying to figure out what the hell Evil Deadpool is would be worth the price of admission. Even as a minor villain, Evil Deadpool could work.\n\nRelated: Black Panther is Finally Getting Revenge on Deadpool\n\nMister Sinister\n\nIf Marvel really wants to swing for the fences, having Deadpool face off against Mister Sinister, one of the biggest X-Men villains around, would be one heck of a way to introduce Wade Wilson and mutants to the MCU.\n\nMister Sinister is obsessed with genetics and isn't afraid to do a little mad science in order to test his queries. The character is telepathic and has a slew of physical and mental abilities. Bringing in Mister Sinister could lay the groundwork for the X-Men in the MCU. Plus, he's been teased in Deadpool 2, so bringing him into the fold would pay off both the past and future of the franchise.\n\nRelated: Celebrate The Development of Deadpool 3 With These Comics And Collectibles!\n\nStryfe\n\nCable and the X-Force were brought into the fold in Deadpool 2, so bringing in Stryfe would make a lot of sense. Stryfe is an evil clone of Cable. When the original Cable was a child, he became infected with a techno-organic virus. He gets sent to the future, where he's cloned and cured of the disease. However, Apocalypse eventually gets his hands on the clone and raises him as his own. Stryfe becomes an anarchist and terrorist.\n\nStryfe along with Evil Deadpool would create an interesting duality between the evil counterparts and Cable and Deadpool. The two heroes taking on evil versions of themselves would be a lot of fun to watch.\n\nRelated: If Deadpool Was Cut in Half... Would TWO Grow Back?\n\nDeath\n\nThe biggest swing for the fences Marvel could take is introducing Lady Death as the main villain in Deadpool 3. In the comics, Thanos' motivations are driven by the living embodiment of death who wants nothing to do with the Mad Titan. However, Deadpool has much better luck with her. In the comics, Death and Deadpool develop feelings for each other. With Thanos out of the way, there are endless possibilities to take Death's character. Plus, Deadpool could joke about Josh Brolin playing Thanos and his lust for Death not making it into the MCU.\n\nShe can be the villain who Deadpool can't kick despite literally representing death and chaos. It would be a bold decision to include her in Deadpool 3 considering she wasn't present in Avengers: End Game or the MCU to date. Perhaps, a more comedic role is the right way to take the character. Regardless, Death seems ripe to show up in the MCU and Deadpool 3 would be a welcome curveball for her to appear.\n\nWhat makes Deadpool 3 so exciting is the almost limitless characters and storylines that could be used to bring Wade Wilson to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Instead of having a handful of villains to play with, Marvel can really go any way they want - small, big or insanely huge. No matter who is chosen for Deadpool 3's villain, it's exciting to see the character come to the MCU. There's tons of potential for him and the X-Force to grow alongside the rest of The Avengers. Who would you like to see as the main villain in Deadpool 3?\n\nNext: 10 Superhero Comedies To Watch If You Like Deadpool\n\nShare Tweet Email\n\nThe King of Marvel's Universe is Finally Claiming His Throne", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Avengers: End Game", "The Avengers", "Marvel Comics", "deadpool", "Deadpool"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 08:01:50 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Deadpool is coming to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
