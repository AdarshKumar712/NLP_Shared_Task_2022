He added: \u201cWe started the year in the fifth spot and managed to maintain that. The biggest aim for us in 2019 was to qualify for the Olympics and we have managed to achieve that under a new coach.\n\n\u201cOur main target in 2020 is to reach the finals of the Olympics and, believe me, it\u2019s achievable. Throughout the year we have managed to maintain the No 5 position in world rankings and there is no reason why we can\u2019t climb from that. But, for that, we have to maintain the consistency which we have showed in the entire 2019.\u201d\n\nThe ace midfielder, who has been nominated for the 2019 FIH Player of the Year award, said encounters against top teams like Netherlands, world champions Belgium and Australia in the upcoming FIH Pro league will give India a fair idea about where the eight-time Olympic champions stand.\n\nIndia, who pulled out of the inaugural edition of the Pro-League, will play the Dutch side on January 18 and 19 before hosting Belgium on February 8 and 9, followed by two more home fixtures against Australia on February 22 and 23.\n\n\u201cThe FIH Pro League is our first step towards Olympic preparation. In the Pro League, we will get to face all the top teams of the world before the Olympics and this experience will give us an idea where we stand before the Olympics,\u201d Manpreet said.\n\nThe skipper said the biggest takeaway for Indian men\u2019s hockey team in 2019 was the transition of quite a few young players into the senior fold.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, we witnessed quite a few young players making it into the senior side,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThey performed to their potential at the international level and outsmarted some of the senior guys. It\u2019s the biggest positive for us, especially in a busy year, where we will be competing at the FIH Pro-League be sides the Olympics.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Sports", "Hockey", "Manpreet Singh", "Tokyo Olympics", "Graham Reid", "FIH Player of the Year award"], "tags": ["Tokyo Olympics", "Hockey", "Indian hockey", "Manpreet Singh"], "authors": ["Scroll Staff"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Indian side managed to maintain its consistency and qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics under a new coach in Australian Graham Reid.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.scroll.in/static/assets/favicon.5f31c86209ff21c26b68aabf47772769.003.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover", "google-play-app": "app-id=in.scroll.android", "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "Scroll.in App for Android"}, "id": {"googleplay": "in.scroll.android"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/108008-nhikgpdqcw-1544683387.jpg"}, "description": "The Indian side managed to maintain its consistency and qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics under a new coach in Australian Graham Reid.", "title": "Hockey: India has what it takes to reach final of 2020 Olympics, says captain Manpreet Singh", "url": "https://scroll.in/field/948485/hockey-india-has-what-it-takes-to-reach-final-of-2020-olympics-says-captain-manpreet-singh", "site": {"identifier": "@thefield_in", "id": "@thefield_in"}, "creator": "@thefield_in"}, "og": {"title": "Hockey: India has what it takes to reach final of 2020 Olympics, says captain Manpreet Singh", "description": "The Indian side managed to maintain its consistency and qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics under a new coach in Australian Graham Reid.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/108008-nhikgpdqcw-1544683387.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 315}, "site_name": "Scroll.in", "url": "https://scroll.in/field/948485/hockey-india-has-what-it-takes-to-reach-final-of-2020-olympics-says-captain-manpreet-singh"}, "description": "The Indian side managed to maintain its consistency and qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics under a new coach in Australian Graham Reid.", "author": "Scroll Staff", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/scroll.in", "tag": "FIH Player of the Year award"}, "keywords": "Sports, Hockey, Manpreet Singh, Tokyo Olympics, Graham Reid, FIH Player of the Year award", "dcterms.title": "Hockey: India has what it takes to reach final of 2020 Olympics, says captain Manpreet Singh", "dcterms.description": "The Indian side managed to maintain its consistency and qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics under a new coach in Australian Graham Reid.", "dcterms.type": "Text", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.language": "en_US", "dcterms.identifier": "https://scroll.in/field/948485/hockey-india-has-what-it-takes-to-reach-final-of-2020-olympics-says-captain-manpreet-singh", "dcterms.created": "2020-01-01T18:22:00+05:30", "dcterms.available": "2020-01-01T18:22:00+05:30", "dcterms.publisher": "https://scroll.in", "dcterms.creator": "Scroll Staff", "dcterms.subject": "Sports, Hockey, Manpreet Singh, Tokyo Olympics, Graham Reid, FIH Player of the Year award", "atdlayout": "articlepage"}, "canonical_link": "https://scroll.in/field/948485/hockey-india-has-what-it-takes-to-reach-final-of-2020-olympics-says-captain-manpreet-singh"}
