REUTERS/Annegret Hilse\n\nThomas Kemmerich, a little-known liberal Free Democrat (FDP), became the first state premier elected with the support of the AfD, with whom Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) sided to the disgust of her national coalition partners.\n\nThe CDU and all the other established parties have previously ostracized the AfD over what they say are racist views held by some of its members.\n\nMerkel\u2019s Social Democrat (SPD) national coalition allies accused her CDU of backtracking on a pledge never to cooperate with a far-right party. The CDU rejected the accusation, saying it was not responsible for how AfD lawmakers voted. Wednesday\u2019s ballot was secret.\n\n\u201cThe events in Thuringia break a taboo in the history of political democracy in the Federal Republic,\u201d SPD Finance Minister Olaf Scholz tweeted. \u201cVery serious questions arise for us with the CDU\u2019s federal leadership.\u201d\n\nCDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said her party\u2019s national leadership opposed both cooperating with the AfD and joining a Kemmerich-led state cabinet. \u201cThe best thing would be for voters in Thuringia to have new elections,\u201d she added.\n\nThe SPD is unlikely to ditch Merkel\u2019s national coalition over the vote in Thuringia but the center-left party said its supporters would hold a protest outside the CDU headquarters in Berlin.\n\n\u201cThe vote on the new premier minister in the state of Thuringia marks a new milestone in German politics and bears the potential of more shockwaves in national politics,\u201d said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.\n\nKemmerich won 45-44 against Bodo Ramelow, the outgoing premier of The Left party. Ramelow\u2019s leftist coalition failed to secure a majority in an October regional election.\n\nKemmerich, whose FDP is the smallest party in the regional assembly, said he would launch talks with the CDU, SPD and Greens on forming a government.\n\nSPD national leader Norbert Walter-Borjans spoke of an \u201cunforgivable dam burst, triggered by the CDU and FDP\u201d.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["US", "GERMANY", "POLITICS", "Germany", "Elections / Voting", "Euro Zone as a Whole", "Western Europe", "Europe", "Government / Politics", "Euro Zone"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "publish_date": "Wed Feb  5 21:33:34 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A German state premier was elected with the support of the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives on Wednesday, shattering the post-war consensus among established parties of shunning the far right.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/favicon/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "worldNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "worldNews;everythingNews;US-The-Wire;USWire_EL", "description": "A German state premier was elected with the support of the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives on Wednesday, shattering the post-war consensus among established parties of shunning the far right.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "US,GERMANY,POLITICS,Germany,Elections / Voting,Euro Zone as a Whole,Western Europe,Europe,Government / Politics,Euro Zone", "news_keywords": "US;GERMANY;POLITICS;Germany;Elections / Voting;Euro Zone as a Whole;Western Europe;Europe;Government / Politics;Euro Zone", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Feb 05 21:33:34 UTC 2020", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2020-02-05T21:33:34+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-idUSKBN1ZZ2XY", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "'Taboo broken' as far right becomes German state kingmaker", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,GERMANY,POLITICS,Germany,Elections / Voting,Euro Zone as a Whole,Western Europe,Europe,Government / Politics,Euro Zone", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-GERMANY-POLITICS", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "'Taboo broken' as far right becomes German state kingmaker", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2020-02-05T21:33:34+0000", "sailthru.title": "'Taboo broken' as far right becomes German state kingmaker", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "'Taboo broken' as far right becomes German state kingmaker", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-idUSKBN1ZZ2XY", "type": "article", "description": "A German state premier was elected with the support of the nationalist Alternati...", "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200205&t=2&i=1486330907&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG1423O", "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-05T21:33:34+0000", "modified_time": "2020-02-05T21:33:34+0000", "section": "World", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "US,GERMANY,POLITICS,Germany,Elections / Voting,Euro Zone as a Whole,Western Europe,Europe,Government / Politics,Euro Zone"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Taboo broken' as far right becomes German state kingmaker", "description": "A German state premier was elected with the support of the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives on Wednesday, shattering the post-war consensus a...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200205&t=2&i=1486330907&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG1423O", "src": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200205&t=2&i=1486330907&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG1423O"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Article -
