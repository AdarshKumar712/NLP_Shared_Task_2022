At that time it looked out across Torbay.\n\nBut it was demolished in 1961 to make way for bungalows. Now all that remains is a small plaque on a roadside granite slab.\n\nBut many of the places that young Agatha knew and loved still remain.\n\nShe may have looked outwardly like a timid young Victorian lady. But Agatha had a wild streak. She loved to ride horses, swim in the rain, go on nocturnal torchlight picnics and roller-skate on the 'rough' pier with her best friend, a boy called Bolton Fletcher. Later she became one of the first Europeans to surf standing up in Honolulu.\n\nAnd during the Great War she volunteered in a makeshift hospital for the war wounded where she first became fascinated by poisons.\n\nAnd when her dashing young first husband had an affair, Agatha was not like other women at the time. Instead of quietly carrying on, she staged a dramatic disappearance and had the world's press and the police scouring the country for 11 days while she stayed at a hotel using the same surname as her husband's lover.\n\nThese are the places that young Agatha was inspired by:\n\nAshfield - the family home\n\n(Image: Herald Express)\n\nOn the slopes above Barton, before the tower block of South Devon Technical College was built, Agatha had a happy family home. She adored Ashfield, with its large garden and monkey puzzle tree.\n\nShe wrote: \"I had a very happy childhood. I had a home and a garden that I loved; a wise and patient nanny; and a father and mother who loved each other dearly.''\n\n(Image: Ed Oldfield)\n\nAs recently as 2017 her grandson Matthew Prichard spoke about his regret that the childhood home in Barton Road had been demolished. Now there is a granite slab with a blue plague marking the spot.\n\n(Image: Herald Express)\n\nPrincess Pier\n\nThe young Agatha roller skated on the pier before the First World War.\n\nIn her autobiography Agatha wrote about roller-skating with the Lucy family and her sister-in-law, Nan Watts in about 1911 .\n\nShe said: \"Roller-skating on the pier was a pastime much in vogue. The surface of the pier was extremely rough, and you fell down a good deal, but it was great fun. Nan Watts and I were fast friends by now. We were not only friends but drinking companions \u2013 we both liked the same drink, cream, ordinary plain, neat cream.\"\n\nSwimming and surfing\n\nAgatha always loved to swim in any weather.\n\nWhen she was a young girl, the beaches in Torquay were segregated by sex.\n\nTorquay Council kept a strict watch on the propriety of sea bathing. In 1899, a bylaw stated that \u201cno person of the male sex shall at any time bathe within 50 yards of a ladies\u2019 bathing machine.\u201d\n\n(Image: Herald Express)\n\nMen and boys swam at the Gentlemen\u2019s Bathing Cove where there was no dress code. Men swam there in the nude or \u201cin their scanty triangles,\u201d Agatha recalled, \u201cdisport[ing] themselves as they pleased.\u201d Women and girls were restricted to swimming at the Ladies\u2019 Bathing Cove an Beacon Cove. Their beach was small and stony, and steeply sloping.\n\nIn 1903, when Agatha was 13, the Council approved mixed bathing on its beaches. Men and women could now swim together at Tor Abbey Sands and Corbyn Head Beach, as well as on the more aristocratic Meadfoot Beach, the one Agatha\u2019s mother\u2019s preferred.\n\nIn her youth she would often swim several hundred metres out to Shag Rock and back from Meadfoot beach.\n\nAfter her first marriage Agatha Christie became one of Britain's earliest \"stand-up\" surfers in 1922 at Waikiki in Honolulu.\n\n(Image: Museum of British Surfing)\n\nBarton Cricket Club\n\n(Image: Torbay Council)\n\nAs a little girl the future Queen of Crime would sit in the shade of the large oak tree which still dominates the Barton ground to keep score and watch her father play cricket.\n\nTorquay Town Hall Assembly Rooms\n\n(Image: Herald Express)\n\nAs a volunteer nurse and later an assistant pharmacist during World War I, this was where the teenage Agatha first learned about poisons, plots and puzzles which became the source material for many of her books.\n\nGrand Hotel - where she spent her honeymoon night\n\nThis is the site of Agatha\u2019s honeymoon to Archie Christie on Christmas Eve 1914. In recognition of that The Grand Hotel has a bedroom suite named after her.\n\nAll Saints Church in Torre\n\nThe Queen of Crime was baptised in All Saints and the seat where she sat every week with her father is still in the church.\n\nVisitors can still see a framed copy of her baptismal certificate, the ornate font where she was baptised at two months old in 1890 and even sit in the pew where Agatha always sat next to her father.\n\nWhere Agatha Christie kept her horse\n\nWhen Agatha was a child the old Torre Conservative Club in South Street, founded in 1912 by Lord Leith of Fyvie, was a coaching house with stables attached which could be accessed via the lane alongside the police station. When she lived at Ashfield in Barton Road, she kept her horse at those stables and would often visit via the Vansittart Road entrance.\n\nGreenway\n\n(Image: Richard Austin)\n\nThe fabulous Greenway estate, with its Grade II* listed house and garden, were acquired by the National Trust in 1999. It is significant as the former home of author Agatha Christie and also the birthplace of Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1537.\n\nAgatha Christie and her second husband Max Mallowan regularly stayed at Greenway after they bought it in 1938.\n\nThe boat house on the Dart\n\nThe landing stage for Greenway was the inspiration for the place in the novel Dead Man's Folly where Mrs Oliver believes the body will be found.\n\nPaignton Picture House\n\nDame Agatha regularly went to Paignton Picture House and her favourite seat is still there. The former Torbay Cinema opened on March 16, 1914, and is hailed as one of the most important purpose-built original cinemas in the country. A trust is trying to restore it to its former glory.\n\nDartmoor - where Agatha wrote her first novel\n\nAgatha completed her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles (1920), at the Moorland Hotel at Hay Tor on Dartmoor and always loved the Moors.\n\nImperial Hotel, Torquay\n\nThe hotel provided the inspiration for the Majestic Hotel in two of Christie\u2019s novels \u2013 Peril at End House and The Body in the Library. In Sleeping Murder, Miss Marple\u2019s final case, the Imperial Hotel appears as itself, with the denouement taking place on the terrace.\n\nThe Pavilion\n\nAgatha Christie was born in Torquay in 1890, and the English Riviera celebrated her centenary with the creation of a hand-crafted bronze bust in her likeness. The bust sits on Palk Street, close to the sadly dilapidated and boarded up Edwardian Pavilion.\n\nAnstey's Cove\n\n(Image: GoogleMaps)\n\nIn her early days Dame Agatha enjoyed nocturnal torchlight picnics at Anstey's Cove - another of her favourite beaches.\n\n(Image: PA Wire)\n\nBurgh Island - and then there were none\n\nThis island opposite Bantham, sits just off Bigbury-on-Sea in the South Hams. It was the inspiration for Agatha's best-love book 'And Then There Were None'.\n\nWalk the Agatha Christie Mile\n\nEstablished in 1990, the centenary of Agatha's birth, there are 11 specific locations along a one mile route around Torquay seafront.\n\nIt leads to places she knew and loved, along the busy harbour and stretching along the palm-lined seafront and promenades.\n\nSome of the plaque locations include; The Grand Hotel, Princess Pier, Princess Gardens, The Pavilion, Agatha Christie Bust, The Strand, Torquay Museum, Royal Torbay Yacht Club, Beacon Cove, Imperial Hotel, Kents Cavern, Torquay Train Station, Cockington and Oldway Mansion.+", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Torquay", "The Queen", "Crime", "Paignton"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Colleen Smith", "Image", "Herald
