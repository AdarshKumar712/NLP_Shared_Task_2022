So it feels like that restaurant vibe, and I'm not sure about the art,\" said Dyer.\n\nRELATED l Composer Angela Little Breaking Barriers in Film Music\n\nThe restaurant lasted 23 years and that was where Mister Musichead Gallery owner Sam Millgrom met Dyer for the first time. They instantly connected with their love of music.\n\n\"That's when I found out he had designed all these album covers that I was so familiar with and had enjoyed over the years,\" said Millgrom.\n\nHe has designed countless album covers while working for Capitol Records and is responsible for some of the most recognizable logos. When Milllgrom saw Dyer\u2019s personal drawings and paintings of jazz legends he knew he needed to curate an exhibit.\n\n\"I thought they were just brilliant and his use of color and the simplicity of it and I thought there was a great market to sell these and the world should know about it,\" said Millgrom.\n\nDyer\u2019s love affair with jazz music began while growing up in South Africa.\n\n\"I'd take my salary and pay my rent and the rest of the money I would buy jazz albums,\" said Dyer.\n\nHe fled apartheid and made his way to the states where his love of the genre flourished while visiting jazz clubs in New York and Los Angles. Over the years that love led him to create.\n\n\"Once I got started on one, I couldn't stop. And I would get so absorbed, I would try to do one or two a day,\" said Dyer.\n\nTaking a look at his art there are all but two jazz legends who are still alive.\n\n\"The legends of jazz should live on through their music and through their visual aspect of their work,\" said Millgrom.\n\nFor Dyer who has used his lifetime to reinvent himself says this first solo show feels like his life is beginning again.\n\n\"I believed in myself, I believed in my work, I believed I could do it, and I try to do it better than anybody else,\" said Dyer.\n\nInspired by his love of jazz and visual art forms to continually create.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["LA West", "California", "San Fernando Valley", "Orange County", "Entertainment", "Sarah Pilla", "LA East"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Published Pm Et Feb."], "publish_date": "Mon Feb 17 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Jazz music is setting the mood as guests come to visit the grand opening of Rod Dyer\u2019s exhibit \u201cJazz Impressions.\u201d", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": null, "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Jazz music is setting the mood as guests come to visit the grand opening of Rod Dyer\u2019s exhibit \u201cJazz Impressions.\u201d", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "HTML5,Flash", "PreferredFormats": "MPEG4"}, "robots": "noodp, noydir", "googlebot": "index, follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=740948885", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.twcable.twcnews", "keywords": "LA West, California, San Fernando Valley, Orange County, Entertainment, Sarah Pilla, LA East", "news_keywords": "LA West, California, San Fernando Valley, Orange County, Entertainment, Sarah Pilla, LA East", "og": {"title": "Iconic Designer Displays Personal Art Depicting Jazz Legends", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/entertainment/2020/02/17/iconic-designer-displays-personal-art-depicting-jazz-legends", "description": "Love affair with jazz began growing up in South Africa.", "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/0217_spec_jazz_gallery2cajpg"}, "twitter": {"title": "Iconic Designer Displays Personal Art Depicting Jazz Legends", "description": "Love affair with jazz began growing up in South Africa.", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/entertainment/2020/02/17/iconic-designer-displays-personal-art-depicting-jazz-legends", "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/0217_spec_jazz_gallery2cajpg"}, "story": {"headline": "Iconic Designer Displays Personal Art Depicting Jazz Legends", "description": "Jazz music is setting the mood as guests come to visit the grand opening of Rod Dyer\u2019s exhibit \u201cJazz Impressions.\u201d"}}, "canonical_link": "https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/entertainment/2020/02/17/iconic-designer-displays-personal-art-depicting-jazz-legends"}
