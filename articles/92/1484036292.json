And after midnight, she went ahead and married longtime boyfriend Randy Bick, reports People. Griffin tweeted a short video of part of the ceremony, which was officiated by none other than Lily Tomlin. \"We promised you atypical,\" wrote Griffin. \"We are in love and we cannot stop laughing.\" Griffin is 59 and Bick is 18 years her junior. They met in 2011. Here is how Tomlin described things: \"What was supposed to be a shallow, 'toot it and boot it' one-night stand has grown and flourished into something far more meaningful,\" she said. \"They stayed together. Then they couldn\u2019t stay away from one another.\" (Griffin is no longer apologetic over an infamous Trump image.)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Kathy Griffin", "celebrity wedding", "Lily Tomlin"], "tags": ["Kathy Griffin"], "authors": ["Newser Editors"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 15:01:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Kathy Griffin surprised her fans on New Year's Eve with news that she was engaged.
