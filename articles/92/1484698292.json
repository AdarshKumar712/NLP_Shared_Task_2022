And that\u2019s just the start\u20264/ Thousands of Yemeni children continue to die in a U.S. fueled civil war; 5/ Iran restarts their nuclear program; 6/ Saudi Arabia and Qatar break relations, pushing Qatar to Iran 7/ Turkey buys weapons from Russia, breaking NATO\u2019s back\u20268/ Brutal crackdown on political dissent in Egypt ramps up 9/ U.S. abandons Kurds to die in Syria, leaves our bases for Russia 10/ U.S. hold on aid to Lebanon weakens their army, empowers Hezbollah 11/ ISIS begins to regroup in Iraq, breaks out of prisons in Syria\u2026The list keeps going, but the point is this: The attacks on our embassy in Iraq (and Iraq\u2019s unwillingness to defend us) is \u2013 on this last day of 2019 \u2013 a reminder of how catastrophic this year has been for U.S. interests in every corner of the Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe list keeps going, but the point is this: The attacks on our embassy in Iraq (and Iraq's unwillingness to defend us) is \u2013 on this last day of 2019 \u2013 a reminder of how catastrophic this year has been for U.S. interests in every corner of the Middle East. \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 31, 2019\n\nthegatewaypundit.com/2019/12/sick-as-fighters-stormed-embassy-democrats-blamed-trump-for-iran-militia-attack-on-baghdad-embassy-some-cheered-for-benghazi-replay/", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.teaparty.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Favicon-Tea-Party.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "google-site-verification": "BUmroTlpSK6UfDeL-RF65T8u9-kL5ZhBtj6sufpwNGY"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.teaparty.org/sick-as-fighters-stormed-baghdad-embassy-democrats-blamed-trump-for-iran-militia-attack-some-cheered-for-benghazi-replay-422978/"}
