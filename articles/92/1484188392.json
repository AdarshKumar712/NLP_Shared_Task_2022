In a section of North Austin that has become a hub for breweries, Hopsquad opened for the first time this weekend with four beers on draft in an airy, dog-friendly taproom.\n\nCousins Alex and Cesar Limon transformed a warehouse, the former site of an office furniture supply company, into Hopsquad \u2014 just about next door to Circle Brewing and a quick drive to other area breweries such as 4th Tap Brewing Co-op, Oskar Blues and Celis Brewery. The new beer maker is easily visible from Braker Lane thanks to a facade completely covered in art by David Rocha.\n\n>> RELATED: Central Machine Works opens as massive brewery, beer garden in East Austin\n\nHopsquad aims to stand out in a crowded local market by turning its brews into memorable characters such as the Lord Zanate IPA and Dutchess of Oltorf Holiday Roggenbier, both of which are on the opening beer list. All four current options are $5. Other beverages available include a cider from the neighboring Fairweather Cider and one red, white, ros\u00e9 and sparkling wine each.\n\nA food truck, Tsuke Honten, is permanently on-site as the Asian fusion vision of chef Michael Che, who previously worked at two stellar sushi spots in Austin, Soto and Kyoten Sushiko, according to his bio on the food truck\u2019s website.\n\nCheck out Hopsquad at 2307 Kramer Ln. during the current taproom hours: 3 to 9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 12 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 12 to 6 p.m. Sunday. (Hopsquad is open this Tuesday only, 6 p.m. to midnight, for New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations.) The open hours may change as the North Austin brewery finds its footing.\n\nFor more information, visit hopsquad.com.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Arianna Auber"], "publish_date": "Mon Dec 30 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "In August 2018, a tweet from Hopsquad Brewing hinted at the struggles the long-in-planning brewery was enduring to get up and running: \"We\u2019ve had more delays than we can count so we stopped promising (opening) dates.\"But Hopsquad hasn\u2019t let another year go by without opening its doors.
