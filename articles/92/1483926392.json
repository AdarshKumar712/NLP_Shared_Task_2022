U.S. Marines were sent from Kuwait to reinforce the compound.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said Tuesday night that \u201cin response to recent events\u201d in Iraq, and at Trump's direction, he authorized the immediate deployment of the infantry battalion from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He did not specify the soldiers\u2019 destination, but a U.S. official familiar with the decision said they will go to Kuwait.\n\n\u201cThis deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against U.S. personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad today,\u201d Esper said in a written statement.\n\nAdditional soldiers from the 82nd Airborne's quick-deployment brigade, known officially as its Immediate Response Force, were prepared to deploy, Esper said. The U.S. official, who provided unreleased details on condition of anonymity, said the full brigade of about 4,000 soldiers may deploy.\n\nThe 750 soldiers deploying immediately were in addition to 14,000 U.S. troops who had deployed to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression, including its alleged sabotage of commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf. At the time of the attack the U.S. had about 5,200 troops in Iraq, mainly to train Iraqi forces and help them combat Islamic State extremists.\n\nThe breach of the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Tuesday was a stark demonstration that Iran can still strike at American interests despite Trump's economic pressure campaign. It also revealed growing strains between Washington and Baghdad, raising questions about the future of the U.S. military mission there.\n\n\u201cThey will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday afternoon, though it was unclear whether his \u201cthreat\u201d meant military retaliation. He thanked top Iraqi government leaders for their \u201crapid response upon request.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Iran News| Features about Iran | Iran news stories"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "President Donald Trump ordered about 750 U.S. soldiers deployed to the Middle East as about 3,000 more prepared for possible deployment in the next several days.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/Content/responsive/RFE/img/webApp/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"title": "Trump Orders Deployment Of 750 Additional Troops After Embassy Attack", "description": "President Donald Trump ordered about 750 U.S. soldiers deployed to the Middle East as about 3,000 more prepared for possible deployment in the next several days.", "keywords": "Iran News| Features about Iran | Iran news stories", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "RFE/RL", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=483099983, app-argument=//30354981.ltr", "og": {"title": "Trump Orders Deployment Of 750 Additional Troops After Embassy Attack", "description": "President Donald Trump ordered about 750 U.S. soldiers deployed to the Middle East as about 3,000 more prepared for possible deployment in the next several days.", "type": "article", "url": "https://en.radiofarda.com/a/trump-orders-deployment-of-750-additional-troops-after-embassy-attack/30354981.html", "site_name": "RFE/RL", "image": {"identifier": "https://gdb.rferl.org/71C1279C-EE15-4F12-BF0D-543CFFE62A8A_w1200_r1_s.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "fb": {"app_id": 568280086670706}, "Author": "AP", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SomeAccount", "image": "https://gdb.rferl.org/71C1279C-EE15-4F12-BF0D-543CFFE62A8A_w1200_r1_s.jpg"}, "news_keywords": "Iran News, iraq, Iran News, Iraq news, US deployment, Iran militia", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/Content/responsive/RFE/img/webApp/ico-144x144.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://en.radiofarda.com/a/trump-orders-deployment-of-750-additional-troops-after-embassy-attack/30354981.html"}
