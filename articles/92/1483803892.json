Gavin Newsom answers a reporter\u2019s question about a report he presented concerning the worsening wildfires in the state, during a news conference, in Rancho Cordova, Calif. Newsom has rejected a $13.5 billion settlement that Pacific Gas & Electric struck just last week with thousands of people who lost homes, businesses and family members in a series of devastating fires that drove the nation\u2019s largest utility into bankruptcy. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File)\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom is offering two $50,000 rewards for information leading to arrests and convictions in two unsolved murders in Sacramento and Fresno.\n\nNewsom\u2019s office announced the rewards Monday in the 2015 shooting of Anthony Barajas, 20, who was shot while sitting in his car in the parking lot of a Home Depot in Sacramento and the killing of Sarah Roberts, 26, who was shot in 2011 outside a party in Fresno.\n\nBarajas had gone to the store with his younger brother when he was shot in the chest by a passing car. He died at a hospital. Barajas had no criminal history and no motive for his shooting has been determined, Newsom\u2019s office said.\n\nSurveillance footage from a nearby gas station showed the gunman\u2019s vehicle, a 1997 to 2005 Buick Century sedan, but the evidence has not led to a suspect.\n\nAnyone with information in the case is asked to call the Sacramento Police Department.\n\nIn the Fresno case, police say Roberts was on her phone outside a New Year\u2019s Eve party when she was shot.\n\nThe mother of two was found unconscious by her brother and taken to the hospital where she died. Investigators believe Roberts may have been caught in the exchange of rival gang gunfire, Newsom\u2019s office said.\n\nAnyone with information on the case is asked to call the Fresno Police Department.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Associated Press", "Alexa Mae Asperin"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 07:13:50 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "California Gov.
