One punched the victim in the head while another suspect threatened him with a stick.So far no arrests have been made.The rash of anti-Semitic assaults - including a stabbing attack during a Hanukkah gathering in Monsey last week - prompted Gov. Andrew Cuomo to visit Brooklyn in a show of support for the Jewish community.The governor shook hands and spoke with Orthodox residents of Williamsburg.He said all of New York feels disturbed by the incidents and New Yorkers stand in solidarity with the Jewish community.----------", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["anti-semitism", "crown heights", "disturbing video", "anti-semitic attack", "nyc", "crime", "brooklyn", "crime in brooklyn", "anti-semitism"], "tags": ["anti semitism", "jewish", "attack", "surveillance video"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 23:14:31 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "New video has been released of another anti-Semitic attack in Brooklyn that happened on Christmas Eve.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.abcotvs.net/abcotv/assets/news/wabc/images/logos/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "New video has been released of another anti-Semitic attack in Brooklyn that happened on Christmas Eve.", "keywords": "anti-semitism, crown heights, disturbing video, anti-semitic attack, nyc, crime, brooklyn, crime in brooklyn, anti-semitism", "tags": "attack,anti-semitism,jewish,surveillance-video", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=404607612, affiliate-data=ct=wabc-smart-banner&pt=302756, app-argument=https://abc7ny.com/story/5805730", "fb": {"app_id": 273339072832914, "pages": 31160214090}, "og": {"site_name": "ABC7 New York", "url": "https://abc7ny.com/5805730/", "title": "New video shows men throw chair at Hasidic man in Brooklyn on Christmas Eve", "description": "New video has been released of another anti-Semitic attack in Brooklyn that happened on Christmas Eve.", "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/5805734_010120-wabc-crownheightsattack-img.jpg?w=1600", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ABC7NY", "creator": "@ABC7NY", "url": "https://abc7ny.com/5805730/", "title": "New video shows men throw chair at Hasidic man in Brooklyn on Christmas Eve", "description": "New video has been released of another anti-Semitic attack in Brooklyn that happened on Christmas Eve.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/5805734_010120-wabc-crownheightsattack-img.jpg?w=1600", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "wabc", "googleplay": "wabc"}, "id": {"iphone": 404607612, "googleplay": "com.abclocal.wabc.news"}}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T23:14:31.000Z", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T23:14:31.000Z", "section": "crime-safety"}, "title": "New video shows men throw chair at Hasidic man in Brooklyn on Christmas Eve", "medium": "website", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR"}, "canonical_link": "https://abc7ny.com/video-shows-men-throw-chair-at-hasidic-man-in-nyc-on-christmas-eve/5805730/"}
