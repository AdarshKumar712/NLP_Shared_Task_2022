But her biggest shock came, when Paul decided to move out and nine months later, her mother Julie gave birth to his child announcing they were together.\n\nREAD ALSO \u2013 Nigerian Model, Chika Lann Throws Sister Out Of Her House For Allegedly Trying To Snatch Her Oyibo Husband\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Daily Mail, Lauren said: \u2018Paul always got on really well with mum. I never thought it strange though, as she was his mum-in-law and he was just being friendly. They\u2019d laugh a lot together. I didn\u2019t think to be worried at all. Who would?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t wait to settle into marriage but the ink was barely dry on our certificate when Paul changed.\u2019\n\nLauren also disclosed how his sister saw text messages between her mom and her estranged husband. When Lauren confronted her mother, she denied there was anything going on saying, \u2018You\u2019re crazy.\u2019\n\nAs things got out of hand between the pair, Paul stopped wearing his wedding ring and walked out on Lauren and their seven-month-old daughter.\n\nSharing her first reaction when she heard that her man had moved in with her mum, said: \u2018It was sick. It\u2019s one of the worst things a mum can do to a daughter.\u2019", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Daily Mail", "Twickenham", "south-west London"], "authors": ["Michael Isaac", "Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan 22 12:04:25 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A British lady\u00a0who lost her husband to her own mother who then had a child for him has said she will never forgive her.The heartbroken lady identified as...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A British lady\u00a0who lost her husband to her own mother who then had a child for him has said she will never forgive her.The heartbroken lady identified as...", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A British lady\u00a0who lost her husband to her own mother who then had a child for him has said she will never forgive her.The heartbroken lady identified as...", "title": "Lady Narrates How Mum Snatched Her Husband (Photo)", "site": "@infonaija", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.informationng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FI-3.jpg?w=640", "alt": "British Lady andMom"}, "creator": "@infonaija", "text": {"title": "Lady Narrates How Mum Snatched Her Husband, Delivered A Baby For Him (Photo)"}}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Lady Narrates How Mum Snatched Her Husband, Delivered A Baby For Him (Photo)", "url": "https://www.informationng.com/2020/01/lady-narrates-how-mum-snatched-her-husband-delivered-a-baby-for-him-photo.html", "description": "A British lady\u00a0who lost her husband to her own mother who then had a child for him has said she will never forgive her.
