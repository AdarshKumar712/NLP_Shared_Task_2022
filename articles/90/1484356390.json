James Handy in 2019, requires private health insurers and the state's Medicaid program, MaineCare, to cover hearing aids up to $3,000 per ear every three years, the Portland Press Herald reports.\n\nAs many as 173,000 Mainers have some level of hearing impairment, according to a report by the state's Bureau of Insurance in 2014.\n\nState law previously required coverage for children under the age of 18 and capped the insurer's expense at $1,400.\n\nMaine joins Arkansas, Illinois, New Hampshire and Rhode Island in requiring hearing aid coverage for both children and adults, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.\n\n(Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
