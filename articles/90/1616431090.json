Earlier this year, nurses and other health workers who were complaining about low salaries and insufficient staff at hospitals, went on strike to ask for more cash.\n\nDemands for cash\n\nTheir demands though were rejected by a government intent on reducing the amount of money it ploughed into the sector.\n\nBut France\u2019s doctor\u2019s, nurses and hospital ancillary staff have effectively become national treasures during the coronavirus.\n\nOften tending to the sick and dying with inadequate clothing or face protection, citizens have acknowledged their heroism and selflessness as the death toll has risen to nearly 29,000 with rounds of applause from apartment balconies.\n\nPeddling parsimony to the public for such a munificent collective would backfire politically for Macron and Philippe.\n\nReconfiguration of care sector\n\n\"The key word here is pragmatism,\u201d said Philippe of the review which is likely to last until July.\n\n\u201cI cannot say now what these discussions will lead to but I've said that we must remove all constraints, whatever they are.\u201d\n\nLast November Macron\u2019s administration promised an additional 1.5 billion euros for hospitals over the next three years, including bonuses for thousands of nurses.\n\nThe government also agreed to absorb 10 billion euros of hospital debt, giving the system the ability to take on new loans for investments.\n\n\u201cBut we must go further,\u201d added Philippe. \u201cA part of this programme must be dedicated to investing in regional services and to improve the lines between hospitals and medico-social services. There must also be better links between the public and private sectors.\"\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["France", "Health", "Coronavirus", "politics"], "tags": ["Health", "France", "#Coronavirus", "Coronavirus", "politics"], "authors": ["Paul Myers"], "publish_date": "Mon May 25 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Thousands of nurses will see their wages increased under a reform of the health service announced on Monday.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/66b1863e-9ea2-11ea-8541-005056bf18d4/w:1240/p:16x9/2020-05-25t140511z_260352734_rc2qvg9c800g_rtrmadp_3_health-coronavirus-france-hospitals_0.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "RFI", "type": "article", "title": "Philippe lines up salary hikes for nurses in post-pandemic health review", "description": "Thousands of nurses will see their wages increased under a reform of the health service announced on Monday.", "see_also": "http://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20200512-french-constitutional-council-passes-emergency-health-law-but-raises-privacy-concerns-covid-19-human-rights-lockdown", "url": "http://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20200525-philippe-lines-up-salary-hikes-for-nurses-in-post-pandemic-health-review"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113191652055439, "pages": 28764872018}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RFI.English/", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/RFI.English/", "published_time": "2020-05-25T18:54:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-05-25T18:54:00+00:00", "section": "france", "tag": "politics"}, "description": "Thousands of nurses will see their wages increased under a reform of the health service announced on Monday.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@RFI_En", "creator": "@myers_rfi"}, "keywords": "France,Health,Coronavirus,politics", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "RFI", "application-name": "RFI", "msapplication-TileColor": "#e2001a", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20200525-philippe-lines-up-salary-hikes-for-nurses-in-post-pandemic-health-review"}
