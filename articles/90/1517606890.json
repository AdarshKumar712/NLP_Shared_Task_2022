This set their minds up to accept things that make them feel good... The more fairy tales and lies he tells the better they feel... Show me a person who believes in Noah's ark and I will show you a Trump voter.\"\n\nThere is abundant evidence right here in our own country for Noah\u2019s flood such as the Grand Canyon and Monument Valley. These geological wonders show evidence of horizontal sedimentary deposition, the result of catastrophic, hydrological forces. Flood waters, carrying millions of tons of sediment, drained off the continent into the oceans hundreds of miles distant carving the canyons and leaving behind the immense buttes and mesas in their wake.\n\nNative Americans have revered these sites for centuries. The larger buttes and mesas in Monument Valley have names like Totem Pole, Three Sisters, Yei-Bi Chei, and Merrick Butte. Each has spiritual significance in the Navajo culture. The Mittens\u2014two buttes standing 978 and 1,023 feet, respectively\u2014were supposedly left behind by the Holy People, deities or spiritual beings who lived on Mother Earth in the beginning of time. Many Native American tribes trace their origin to the Grand Canyon.\n\nThe Havasupai believed it to be the birthplace of the human race. The Hopi believed it was where all living things came through another dimension into our world.\n\nBut perhaps the Hualapai have the most interesting tradition about the origin of the Grand Canyon. They believe the earth was once covered by a flood. \u201cThe Great Hero\u201d then stuck the Earth with a huge knife, rocking it back and forth, creating deep gorges so that the water could drain away.\n\nHow did such beliefs persist among Native Americans for so many centuries? The Hualapai aren\u2019t the only people with such a story. Genesis 7:19 states: \u201c\u2026The waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth, and all the high hills under the whole heaven were covered.\u201d The Bible goes on to recount how God\u2014The Great Hero of the Judeo-Christian tradition\u2014caused the flood waters to recede from the Earth.\n\nNoah's flood is mentioned throughout the Old and New Testaments. Psalm 104 and Job 22 refer to the great deluge as does Jesus in the Gospels. The apostle Peter also mentions Noah's flood in both of his epistles. But the event first appears in Genesis chapters 6 through 9, where it is described in detail.\n\n\u201cThe Lord saw how great man's wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time. The Lord was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain. So, the Lord said, I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth -- men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air -- for I am grieved that I have made them. But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord\u201d (Genesis 6:5-8).\n\nGod told Noah exactly how to build the ark and gave him 120 years to complete the task. Along with his sons and quite possibly, plenty of hired help (although the Bible doesn't specifically mention this), Noah built a huge cargo ship out of gopherwood and pitch.\n\nWhen the rains came, Noah, his wife, their three sons, and their wives went into the ark. Along with them, they brought two of almost every kind of animal and bird. (Noah was instructed to take seven pairs of every animal and bird considered clean for sacrificial purposes.)\n\nImagine the stories that spread through the region about that \"crazy old man building the big boat.\" People possibly traveled for miles to see this sight -- because it had never rained. The Bible describes the conditions on the antediluvian Earth as vastly different from our present-day weather patterns (Genesis 2:6).\n\nDuring the many years that the ark was under construction, anyone could have been spared by believing in Noah's preaching. The Bible says that he warned his neighbors of God's impending judgment. \"God did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others\" (2 Peter 2:5).\n\nWhen the ark was completed, it stood laden with cargo on dry ground for seven days. God left the door open -- anyone could have walked in and been saved. But aside from Noah's family, no one else entered. At the end of the week, the Lord shut the door and the disaster began. The rain started and the underground springs burst open.\n\nThe vast extent to which the Earth's surface is covered with water is only one of many evidences for a massive, worldwide flood. Other evidence abounds.\n\nFossil graveyards, containing many different types of remains, have been found; these collections suggest that herds of animals massed together to escape a catastrophe or that their carcasses were deposited in low-lying areas and then buried under tons of water-borne sediment. Marine fossils have been discovered on top of mountains rimming the Mediterranean Sea. I often find these fossils in my annual treks through the Peruvian Andes at altitudes above 12,000 feet. And horizontal sedimentary layering in the Grand Canyon and other places points to a global deluge.\n\nIn the fall of 2000, an issue of U.S. News and World Report reported \"an amazing archaeological discovery beneath the surface of the Black Sea.\" Robert Ballard (who found the Titanic) led an archaeological team that discovered \"a large wooden building 12 miles offshore at a depth of more than 300 feet.\" Ballard said, \"Apparently there is an ancient coastline some 550 feet below the present sea level.\n\n\"It was a find beyond our wildest imaginations,\" he said.\n\nScientists have claimed there is photographic evidence that may be the remains of Noah's Ark. Military and private satellite snapshots of Mount Ararat in eastern Turkey reveal an anomaly that researchers say might be the remains of Noah's Ark. The first pictures of what has come to be known as the Ararat Anomaly date back to 1949. U.S. intelligence officials analyzed aircraft imagery of Mount Ararat taken in June of that year. The photos show a unique feature at 15,500 feet on the northwestern plateau.\n\nPorcher Taylor, an assistant professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia and an expert in satellite imaging, has gathered evidence on the Ararat Anomaly since 1993. He estimates the anomaly to be approximately 600 feet long.\n\nAnother expert, a naval engineer and architect, has examined the photographs and believes that the structure shows \"prongs\" or \"ribs\" similar to what one would expect to find on the keel of an ancient marine vessel. The most recent satellite evidence comes from Space Imaging's Ikonos 2, which can resolve images as small as one meter across. From October 1999 through the summer of 2000, the mountain was photographed. It was reported that a \u201cseven-person team of independent scientists and analysts scrutinized the batch of images. While the photos clearly show some type of feature, the team was divided in their interpretation. While some felt the anomaly could be human-made, others voted for rock or deferred to inconclusive data.\u201d\n\nThis evidence is not just interesting on its face but demonstrates the number of scientists, historians, theologians and open-minded journalists willing to follow the evidence wherever it leads.\n\nTo those of us who embrace the Bible\u2019s narratives as being true accounts of historical events, none of the evidence comes as a surprise. \u201cWe have not followed cunningly devised fables,\u201d (2 Peter 1:16) but we have the accounts of \u201ceyewitness.\u201d\n\nThese eyewitnesses \u2013 the writers of both the Old and New Testaments \u2013 have created the expectation that the evidence demonstrated by the Earth\u2019s geology, Native American traditions and archaeological discoveries would support the Bible's accounts of events.\n\nAs it turns out, Trump voters are in good company with a lot of other, really smart people.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Chuck Todd", "Noah's Ark"], "tags": ["Topics", "Chuck Todd", "Tags", "Noah's Ark", "Gift Guides"], "authors": ["Gregory", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Chuck Todd\u2019s Sunday commentary on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d equating Trump .01/02/2020 10:41:36AM EST.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 967808926746051, "pages": "41632789656,103971336305218,319569361390023,106547192707583,124538510989702,283971595408,15418366158,153162531376557,127519040661256,123834811060739,305174559545115,321502821264274,413465452078762,492802317512753,140705212665688,116757565026850,114013445328868"}, "description": "Chuck Todd\u2019s Sunday commentary on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d equating Trump .01/02/2020 10:41:36AM EST.", "keywords": "Chuck Todd, Noah's Ark", "robots": "index, follow", "author": "Gregory  Rummo", "og": {"title": "Mr. Todd \u2013 Noah\u2019s Ark Is Not a Fairy Tale", "type": "Article", "url": "https://townhall.com/columnists/gregoryrummo/2020/01/01/mr-todd--noahs-flood-is-not-a-fairy-tale-n2558758", "image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/190/cd2f76bb-c9bc-41eb-8caa-e5e83f0c70d8.jpg", "site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Chuck Todd\u2019s Sunday commentary on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d equating Trump"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mr. Todd \u2013 Noah\u2019s Ark Is Not a Fairy Tale", "image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/190/cd2f76bb-c9bc-41eb-8caa-e5e83f0c70d8.jpg?210", "url": "https://townhall.com/columnists/gregoryrummo/2020/01/01/mr-todd--noahs-flood-is-not-a-fairy-tale-n2558758?210", "description": "Chuck Todd\u2019s Sunday commentary on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d equating Trump", "site": "@townhallcom"}}, "canonical_link": "https://townhall.com/columnists/gregoryrummo/2020/01/01/mr-todd--noahs-flood-is-not-a-fairy-tale-n2558758"}
