(Image source: Bloomberg)\n\nUK chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc said it\u2019s struck a new license agreement with Apple Inc, reviving a business relationship that had all but ended in recent years.\n\nThe company, which was sold to Chinese buyout firm Canyon Bridge Capital Partners for 500 million pounds ($663 million) in September 2017, said Thursday it \u201cformed a new multi-year license agreement under which Apple has access to a wider range of Imagination\u2019s intellectual property in exchange for license fees.\u201d\n\nApple previously used graphics chips or GPUs in its iPhones and iPads that were designed by Imagination Technologies, but it moved to its own internal chip designs starting with the iPhone X in 2017 and the iPad Pro in 2018. The US company also uses its own graphics processors in the Apple Watch. It told Imagination Technologies in 2017 that it would stop using its intellectual property in new products within two years.\n\nWhen Imagination Technologies, then a public company, announced the loss of Apple as its biggest customer, its stock plummeted. The British company said in 2018 there may be \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d regarding the future of the company if Apple doesn\u2019t pay any royalties on its latest generation of iPhones and iPads.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Apple has paid those fees, but Imagination has argued it would be \u201cextremely challenging for Apple to design a GPU in a way that allows them not to pay royalties to Imagination.\u201d\n\nThe company didn\u2019t specify on Thursday which intellectual property the latest agreement covers, but Imagination\u2019s IP related to graphics and artificial intelligence could be key to future Apple devices. The iPhone maker uses a combination of supplier deals and acquisitions to build up its portfolio of patents and designs. Last year, Apple acquired Intel Corp\u2019s modem unit to design cellular chips for future devices.\n\nFor all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["apple", "apple imagination technologies deal", "apple chip imagination technologies", "imagination technologies gpu", "apple gpu design"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 10:11:22 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "UK chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc said it\u2019s struck a new license agreement with Apple Inc, reviving a business relationship that had all but ended in recent years.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/10/fav-icon.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=990", "news_keywords": "Apple, Apple Imagination Technologies deal, Apple chip Imagination Technologies, Imagination Technologies GPU, Apple GPU design", "keywords": "apple, apple imagination technologies deal, apple chip imagination technologies, imagination technologies gpu, apple gpu design", "google-site-verification": "UzbS4ghT-l3F85eDiPbzEUeeKcvrnrGCgvsNHCRgvIc", "msvalidate.01": "CCA9DA5B985004F4462DA743E776C636", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "fb": {"pages": 215732349153100}, "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-strikes-new-deal-with-uk-chip-designer-it-sidelined-in-2017-6195756/?ia_markup=1"}, "description": "UK chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc said it\u2019s struck a new license agreement with Apple Inc, reviving a business relationship that had all but ended in recent years.", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-strikes-new-deal-with-uk-chip-designer-it-sidelined-in-2017-6195756/", "site_name": "The Indian Express", "locale": "en_US", "title": "Apple strikes new deal with UK chip designer it sidelined in 2017", "description": "UK chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc said it\u2019s struck a new license agreement with Apple Inc, reviving a business relationship that had all but ended in recent years.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/01/Apple_iPhone11_BLOOM2.jpg?w=759", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 759, "height": 422}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "The Indian Express", "creator": "@indianexpress", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-strikes-new-deal-with-uk-chip-designer-it-sidelined-in-2017-6195756/", "title": "Apple strikes new deal with UK chip designer it sidelined in 2017", "description": "UK chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc said it\u2019s struck a new license agreement with Apple Inc, reviving a business relationship that had all but ended in recent years.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/01/Apple_iPhone11_BLOOM2.jpg?w=759", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 759, "height": 422}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-02T10:11:22+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T10:11:22+05:30"}, "robots": "NOODP", "majestic-site-verification": "MJ12_ad7db024-a46c-482a-bb2f-e1ae09432a65", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/10/fav-icon.png?w=120"}, "canonical_link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-strikes-new-deal-with-uk-chip-designer-it-sidelined-in-2017-6195756/"}
