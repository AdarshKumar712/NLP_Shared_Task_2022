Anyone who doesn't wish to ride is asked to meet the group at The Scout at 5 p.m.\n\nLulu's Thai Noodle Shop is also hosting an event in remembrance of Sanders, who worked at the Westwood, Kansas, location.\n\n\"We are saddened by the loss of such a kind, gentle and positive soul,\" a Lulu's spokesperson said.\n\nA flyer for the event reads \"One of our own was struck while riding his bike. We all love Pablo, so on the 7th and 8th of January the proceeds from every Pad Thai with tofu, veggies or chicken will be donated to our dear friend.\"\n\nAn online petition asking Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas and the city council to take action to make streets safer for everyone had more than 400 supporters as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u2014", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Kansas City", "pablo sanders died in crash", "pablo sanders jr", "valentine road", "cyclist hit by a car", "pablo sanders hit by a car", "southwest trafficway", "Kansas City News", "pablo sanders killed in crash"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 18:51:33 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A cyclist who was hit by a car just before midnight on Christmas Eve died Monday, family and friends told 41 Action News.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A cyclist who was hit by a car just before midnight on Christmas Eve died Monday, family and friends told 41 Action News.", "keywords": "Kansas City,pablo sanders died in crash,pablo sanders jr,valentine road,cyclist hit by a car,pablo sanders hit by a car,southwest trafficway,Kansas City News,pablo sanders killed in crash", "brightspot.contentId": "0000016f-5d3e-dfe1-a9ff-5f7f95f70000", "og": {"title": "Cyclist hit by car on Christmas Eve passes away", "url": "https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/cyclist-hit-by-car-on-christmas-eve-passes-away", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cbdc158/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x336+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F63%2F68%2F3ae2f7e84b1db3ac166972856c6e%2Fbike.JPG.png", "url": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cbdc158/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x336+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F63%2F68%2F3ae2f7e84b1db3ac166972856c6e%2Fbike.JPG.png", "secure_url": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cbdc158/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x336+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F63%2F68%2F3ae2f7e84b1db3ac166972856c6e%2Fbike.JPG.png", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/png", "alt": "Cyclist critically hit, community raises awareness of biking in KCMO"}, "description": "A cyclist who was hit by a car just before midnight on Christmas Eve died Monday, family and friends told 41 Action News.", "site_name": "KSHB", "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.kshb.com/41-action-news-staff", "published_time": "2019-12-31T18:51:33.119", "modified_time": "2019-12-31T19:49:40.891", "section": "Local News", "tag": "News"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SarahPlakeTV", "description": "A cyclist who was hit by a car just before midnight on Christmas Eve died Monday, family and friends told 41 Action News.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cbdc158/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x336+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F63%2F68%2F3ae2f7e84b1db3ac166972856c6e%2Fbike.JPG.png", "alt": "Cyclist critically hit, community raises awareness of biking in KCMO"}, "site": "@41ActionNews", "title": "Cyclist hit by car on Christmas Eve passes away"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1557642287829215, "profile_id": "SarahPlakeTV", "pages": 68122026189}, "brightspot.cached": "true", "google-site-verification": "Ik1_sbtbrlGAtwF3IVdn1ctvghz9fU0SY5urciQew"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/cyclist-hit-by-car-on-christmas-eve-passes-away"}
