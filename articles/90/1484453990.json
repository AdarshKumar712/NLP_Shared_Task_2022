Our food budget has increased by 30-40% a month.\u201dPotato prices have also gone up by 20-100%. Potatoes, which were available at Rs 20 till last week, now cost Rs 25-40 per kg.Suresh, a wholesaler at Dubbaga Mandi, said the prices of tomato and potato had gone up due to reduction in supply following damages to the crop due to extremely cold weather prevailing for about a month in different parts of the country. Onion price continues to hover around Rs 100 per kg. Raju from Naveen Galla Mandi at Sitapur Road said no relief was in sight in near future. Sale of these basic vegetables have gone down by almost 50% collectively as it is significantly hampering household budget.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Lucknow news", "Lucknow latest news", "Lucknow news live", "Lucknow news today", "Today news Lucknow", "spurt in tomato", "onion & potato prices burns hole in pockets", "lucknow news", "lucknow civic news", "civic news of lucknow"], "tags": ["Delhi Air Pollution", "Fire in Mumbai", "Mumbai Rains", "Hyderabad Rain", "Bangalore Temperature", "Delhi Temperature", "Srinagar encounter", "Chennai Weather", "Delhi Smog"], "authors": ["Tnn"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Prices of tomato, onion and potato \u2013 staple vegetables in every Indian kitchen \u2013 are going out of reach of the common man.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Prices of tomato, onion and potato \u2013 staple vegetables in every Indian kitchen \u2013 are going out of reach of the common man.", "keywords": "Lucknow news, Lucknow latest news, Lucknow news live, Lucknow news today, Today news Lucknow,spurt in tomato,onion & potato prices burns hole in pockets,lucknow news,lucknow civic news,civic news of lucknow", "robots": "NOODP", "og": {"title": "No cheer: Spurt in tomato, onion & potato prices burns hole in pockets | Lucknow News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/no-cheer-spurt-in-tomato-onion-potato-prices-burns-hole-in-pockets/articleshow/73063811.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063801,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-255706,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "Prices of tomato, onion and potato \u2013 staple vegetables in every Indian kitchen \u2013 are going out of reach of the common man.", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/no-cheer-spurt-in-tomato-onion-potato-prices-burns-hole-in-pockets/articleshow/73063811.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063801,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-255706,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "No cheer: Spurt in tomato, onion & potato prices burns hole in pockets | Lucknow News - Times of India", "description": "Prices of tomato, onion and potato \u2013 staple vegetables in every Indian kitchen \u2013 are going out of reach of the common man.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "news_keywords": "spurt in tomato,onion & potato prices burns hole in pockets,lucknow news,lucknow civic news,civic news of lucknow", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/no-cheer-spurt-in-tomato-onion-potato-prices-burns-hole-in-pockets/articleshow/73063811.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 227797153941209, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/no-cheer-spurt-in-tomato-onion-potato-prices-burns-hole-in-pockets/articleshow/73063811.cms"}
