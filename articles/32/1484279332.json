He said BJP-Sena alliance had received the mandate but BJP despite winning 105 seats is now out of power.\n\n\"Why Shiv Sena did not remember PM Modi at the time of government formation? Shiv Sena instead joined hands with Congress and NCP to form the government,\" he noted.\n\n\"Uddhav Thackeray had promised Sena chief Bal Thackeray that there will be Shiv Sena CM one day. But had he promised that party's CM will be on the support of Congress and NCP?\" asked Fadnavis adding,\n\n\"Bal Thackeray will be crying in heaven if he learns about the Sena's move to go with the NCP and Congress after polls.\" He claimed that Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government will not complete its tenure.\n\nFadnavis attacked MVA government for the crop loan waiver announced recently saying that the government has betrayed farmers who are in distress. ''Betrayal is a base for the MVA government. The party has betrayed the people's mandate and now farmers also,'' he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Devendra Fadnavis", "Maha govt", "Delhi Matoshree"], "tags": ["Delhi Matoshree", "Maha govt", "Devendra Fadnavis"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "He said the Sena has insulted the people's mandate and has been dishonest with the people of the state.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "Devendra Fadnavis,Maha govt,Delhi Matoshree", "description": "He said the Sena has insulted the people's mandate and has been dishonest with the people of the state.", "title": "'Delhi Matoshree' controlling Maha govt, says ex-CM", "keywords": "Devendra Fadnavis,Maha govt,Delhi Matoshree", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/delhi-matoshree-controlling-maha-govt-says-ex-cm", "title": "'Delhi Matoshree' controlling Maha govt, says ex-CM", "image": {"identifier": "https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2019-12%2F5fd83480-a9eb-4af9-ba83-045082398aa1%2FFadnavis5.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C760%2C399&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "site_name": "Latest Indian news, Top Breaking headlines, Today Headlines, Top Stories at Free Press Journal"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Delhi Matoshree' controlling Maha govt, says ex-CM", "image": "https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2019-12%2F5fd83480-a9eb-4af9-ba83-045082398aa1%2FFadnavis5.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C760%2C428&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true", "creator": "Staff Reporter", "site": "Latest Indian news, Top Breaking headlines, Today Headlines, Top Stories at Free Press Journal", "domain": "https://www.freepressjournal.in"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2254637581419855, "pages": 178566438825717}, "viewport": "width=device-width,height=device-height,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=2.0,minimum-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/delhi-matoshree-controlling-maha-govt-says-ex-cm"}
