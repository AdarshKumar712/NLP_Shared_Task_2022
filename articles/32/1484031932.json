According to the study, published in the journal Neuron, different classes of nerve cells control positive and negative motivations, sending opposing signals along this information-processing hub in the brain.\n\nThe researchers, including Bo Li from the Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory (CSHL) in the US, said the balance of activity between these two groups of nerves may determine whether a person acts to seek out pleasurable experiences, or avoid painful ones.\n\nAccording to the scientists, the behaviours controlled by these nerve cells are disrupted in people with mental illness. The researchers said people suffering from depression may stop doing things that once gave them pleasure, whereas those with anxiety disorders may go to greater lengths to avoid potential threats.\n\nThey added that a person's ability to recognise and respond to potential rewards or punishments partially depends on a brain region called the ventral pallidum. When animals seek rewards, such as a sip of water, or avoid punishments, such as an annoying puff of air, this region was found to be active.\n\nThey found that nerve cells which used the transmitter chemical known as GABA to dampen motivation influencing activity were important in this brain region for encouraging the mice to seek a water reward.\n\nOn the other hand, the study said the nerve cells which used the neurotransmitter called glutamate to excite this brain circuit were essential for avoiding the air-puff punishment.\n\n- PTI", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Brain", "Behaviours", "Pleasure", "decoded"], "tags": ["Behaviours", "Brain", "Pleasure", "decoded"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "According to the scientists, the behaviours controlled by these nerve cells are disrupted in people with mental illness", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "Brain,Behaviours,Pleasure,decoded", "description": "According to the scientists, the behaviours controlled by these nerve cells are disrupted in people with mental illness", "title": "Decoded: How brain balances pleasure", "keywords": "Brain,Behaviours,Pleasure,decoded", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/health/decoded-how-brain-balances-pleasure", "title": "Decoded: How brain balances pleasure", "image": {"identifier": "https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2020-01%2Fe9ac6835-8bee-44b2-8586-dc42c37f4f2c%2Fetc_3rd_lead_jan_1.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C1500%2C788&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "site_name": "Latest Indian news, Top Breaking headlines, Today Headlines, Top Stories at Free Press Journal"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Decoded: How brain balances pleasure", "image": "https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2020-01%2Fe9ac6835-8bee-44b2-8586-dc42c37f4f2c%2Fetc_3rd_lead_jan_1.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C1500%2C844&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true", "creator": "Agencies", "site": "Latest Indian news, Top Breaking headlines, Today Headlines, Top Stories at Free Press Journal", "domain": "https://www.freepressjournal.in"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2254637581419855, "pages": 178566438825717}, "viewport": "width=device-width,height=device-height,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=2.0,minimum-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/health/decoded-how-brain-balances-pleasure"}
