It shows what would likely happen if superheroes actually existed. It isn\u2019t afraid to get dark and weird, which makes it wildly entertaining. The Boys channels anarchic energy that makes it fresh and exciting.\n\nIn my opinion, Amazon outdid itself with this series, and it\u2019s also pretty cool that the series was filmed in Toronto. You can recognize parts of the city as you watch, which is always fun.\n\nHonourable mentions: The Umbrella Academy and The Witcher on Netflix\n\nFavourite movie from a streaming service: El Camino\n\nI remember saying for years that I wanted to know what happened to Jesse Pinkman after he drove through that chain-link fence. Well, Netflix delivered this year with the Breaking Bad movie.\n\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie brought the closure that I wanted for so many years after the series finale of Breaking Bad. It was a wonderful final chapter for a series filled with amazing characters. The movie captured the essence of Breaking Bad and brought back all the characters that viewers, including myself, so dearly missed.\n\nAlthough several people complained that it was too slow or too boring, they seem to have forgotten that Breaking Bad itself was not a fast-paced show, and so the movie stayed true to this storytelling format.\n\nHonourable mentions: To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before and Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile on Netflix\n\nFavourite podcast: Crime Junkie\n\nAs someone who enjoys true crime, this podcast is pretty great because it focuses on a different case each episode. The hosts are when they recap cases and offer a number of different theories.\n\nThe episodes are also grouped in different categories of cases, such as Missing, Serial Killer, Murdered and Wanted. The hosts also look at a number of Canadian cases like the Robert Pickton murders and the Highway 16 murders in British Columbia.\n\nCrime Junkie will give you chills and have you clicking the next episode as soon as you finish one. This podcast got me through many long commutes this year and is one that I\u2019ll definitely be listening to next year.\n\nFavourite app: Yummly\n\nAs someone who can\u2019t cook at all, I love using recipe apps. After testing out a few, I found that \u2018Yummly\u2019 is a great app because it\u2019s suited for cooks of all levels of expertise. I also really like that I can filter out any recipes that include peas.\n\nI used this app quite a bit this year during my time as a busy grad student who had no time to prepare difficult recipes. I was able to choose quick and easy recipes on the app to make on a busy schedule.\n\nTop milestone: Getting a job as a tech reporter in Toronto\n\nDuring my masters program, I interned at MobileSyrup and thoroughly enjoyed my time here and all of the topics I got to cover. Fast-forward to October after I finished my masters at Western University, and I started as a full-time staff reporter.\n\nAs someone who has always wanted to work in downtown Toronto doing something I love, I feel beyond grateful to have been able to join the wonderfully talented MobileSyrup team.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping that 2020 will be even better than 2019!", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "As 2019 has come to a close, it's time to reflect on the number of awesome things that the year brought to the world of tech, streaming services and podcasts.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/themes/mobile-syrup-2016/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "google-site-verification": "E8CSmkg16alzLLtGQ-KqISfVFiPFL0btnZjulPrPbHk", "msapplication-TileColor": "#c93827", "theme-color": "#c93827", "description": "As 2019 has come to a close, it's time to reflect on the number of awesome things that the year brought to the world of tech, streaming services and podcasts.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Aisha Malik's favourite things of 2019", "description": "As 2019 has come to a close, it's time to reflect on the number of awesome things that the year brought to the world of tech, streaming services and podcasts.", "url": "https://mobilesyrup.com/2020/01/01/aisha-maliks-favourite-things-of-2019/", "site_name": "MobileSyrup", "updated_time": "2019-12-30T21:43:39-05:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aishia-fave-things-header-1024x576.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aishia-fave-things-header-1024x576.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 576}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MobileSyrup/", "tag": "crime junkie", "section": "Features", "published_time": "2020-01-01T14:06:57-05:00", "modified_time": "2019-12-30T21:43:39-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439991766169589}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "As 2019 has come to a close, it's time to reflect on the number of awesome things that the year brought to the world of tech, streaming services and podcasts.", "title": "Aisha Malik's favourite things of 2019", "site": "@MobileSyrup", "image": "https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aishia-fave-things-header-scaled.jpg", "creator": "@AiishaMalik1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mS4BQl5a_400x400.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://mobilesyrup.com/2020/01/01/aisha-maliks-favourite-things-of-2019/"}
