We cannot thank these guys and the entire community that came out to support [the event] enough.\u201d\n\nElara\u2019s parents Nico and Jessica have always had a special connection with the restaurant, as it is where they had their first date and even had their engagement photos done, giving the impressive donation an even bigger impact.\n\n\u201cCentral has always been a place that we have gone to feel at home,\u201d added Chisholm. \u201cThey have truly become like family to us, and we thank them so much for the continued support as we get through Elara\u2019s treatments.\"\n\n\n\nIf you were unable to attend the fundraiser at Central, but are still hoping to donate to the cause, a GoFundMe campaign has been set up for the family.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Kelowna", "news", "local", ""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Local news for Kelowna and the Okanagan Valley.
