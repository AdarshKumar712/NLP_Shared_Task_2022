The Lombardy region\u2019s health department put the number of injured at 31.\n\n\u201cIt could have been a lot worse,\u201c Cardona said, adding that there were only 33 people on board the train. Only one person was in the first car and two people in the second when the accident occurred, he said.\n\n\u201cI thought I was dead,\u201c a survivor told local newspaper Liberta from hospital in Piacenza where he was being treated for minor injuries. \u201cI closed my eyes and prayed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe train was going very fast, perhaps 300 kph,\u201c said the unnamed man in his 20s.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, I felt a violent blow. A really loud roar,\u201c said the man who was travelling with a friend in the second carriage.\n\n\u201cWe held hands tightly to avoid falling. The wagon overturned and while waiting for help we went out through a hole to save ourselves,\u201c he said, adding that they were stuck on the crashed train for 15 minutes.\n\nThe interior minister has been informed and the prosecutor was already at the scene of the accident, the cause of which was unknown, he said. Two helicopters, hundreds of firemen, police and other authorities descended on the open farmland area outside of Lodi.\n\n\u201cWe are greatly saddened by the two deaths, the two rail workers, and we express our solidarity with the families,\u201c said Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t yet say anything\u201d about the cause of the crash, he told journalists in Rome.\n\nRipped metal\n\nThe Milan-Salerno train was en route to Bologna when it came off the tracks before dawn.\n\nVideo images showed ripped metal at the front of the first car, where the engine separated from the train. The first car was flipped on its side and appeared to be still attached to the rest of the train.\n\nThe engine car could be seen resting on its side on the other side of a nearby railway building several dozen metres away.\n\nAccording to initial findings reported by the media, the engine went off the rails and struck a freight wagon on a parallel track before hitting the building.\n\nItalian media reported that work had been done on the track on Wednesday night, but Cardona said it was premature to jump to conclusions on a link between that work and the accident.\n\n\u201cLine maintenance is done continually and it\u2019s much too early to associate the accident to maintenance,\u201c he said.\n\nItaly\u2019s last serious train accident occurred in January 2018, when three women died and about 100 passengers were injured when a packed train derailed near Milan due to poor track maintenance.\n\nManagers and employees of Italy\u2019s state railway, RFI, as well as two former members of the national railway safety agency were charged with negligent homicide and other crimes. - AFP", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Local Counsel", "My View", "Policy Matters", "Another Take", "Off The Cuff", "On The Other Hand", "Freespace", "Just Different", "Law Speak", "Speaking From The Heart", "Making Sens"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "LODI: Two rail workers were killed and about 30 people injured on Thursday when a high-speed train derailed before dawn near Milan in northern Italy, ...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thesundaily.my/base-portlet/webrsrc/ctxvar/8d59900f-08ec-4018-8768-dc251cb30624.png", "meta_data": {"description": "LODI: Two rail workers were killed and about 30 people injured on Thursday when a high-speed train derailed before dawn near Milan in northern Italy, ...", "og": {"title": "Two train drivers killed in Italy high-speed rail crash", "description": "LODI: Two rail workers were killed and about 30 people injured on Thursday when a high-speed train derailed before dawn near Milan in northern Italy, ...", "image": "https://www.thesundaily.my/binrepository/480x320/0c35/480d250/none/11808/LTMR/italy-train-accident-0-5695992_943782_20200206193015.jpg", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.thesundaily.my/world/two-train-drivers-killed-in-italy-high-speed-rail-crash-NH1977690", "site_name": "www.thesundaily.my"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "viewport": "width=device-width", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theSundaily"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thesundaily.my/world/two-train-drivers-killed-in-italy-high-speed-rail-crash-NH1977690"}
