Amy Klobuchar arrived at Johnston Middle School where she did a live television interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow.\n\nHer staffers then whisked her into a large gym, where a couple hundred residents sat in the bleachers, many wearing the colors of their favorite candidates' campaigns.\n\n\"What unites us is bigger than what divides us,\" Klobuchar told the group. \"I hope you all know that in this room \u2014 that the most important thing is that we win in the general election.\"\n\nSupporters of several candidates cheered her points on party unity during the three-minute speech.\n\nAfter speaking to another precinct in a smaller gym, and another live interview with NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd, Klobuchar got back on her green tour bus. Later Monday night, Klobuchar won one of the two Johnston precincts where she spoke, thanks to strong second-choice support.\n\nA couple hundred supporters chanted \"Amy! Amy!\" as the Minnesota senator took the stage at her post-caucus \"victory\" party at the Des Moines Marriott Downtown.\n\nShe first acknowledged delays in reporting from precinct sites \u2014 just 34 of 1,765 Iowa precincts had reported results by the time she took the stage at 10:30 p.m.\n\nA spokesperson for the Iowa Democratic Party said in a statement Monday night that there were \u201cinconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results\" that \"will simply take time\" to validate. The party is using preference cards and photos to do so, the statement said.\n\n\"We know there\u2019s delays, but we know one thing \u2014 we are punching above our weight,\" Klobuchar said. \"We are going to be here, it looks like, a really long time tonight. But let\u2019s stay in a good spirit!\"\n\nSince announcing her candidacy in February 2019, the Minnesota senator has made more than 30 trips to Iowa and is the only remaining Democratic candidate to have toured each of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties. She held more Iowa events than anyone who qualified for the CNN/Des Moines Register Democratic Presidential Debate in January.\n\nAs soon as President Donald Trump's legal team finished opening arguments in his impeachment trial last week, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar flew to Iowa.\n\nThe impromptu appearance \u2014 a sign of Klobuchar's all-in-on-Iowa mindset less than a week before the caucuses \u2014 brought nearly 200 people to a Council Bluffs bar. She returned to Washington, D.C., the same night.\n\n\"We are really focused \u2026 on getting everywhere in Iowa and to make the point that you win by meeting people,\" Klobuchar said at a Forest City house party in November. \"You win by meeting each voter one at a time.\"\n\nShe earned 18 endorsements from Iowa lawmakers, including Rep. Andy McKean of Anamosa, who was the longest-serving Republican in the legislature until he switched parties last year.\n\n\"Amy has shown over the years that she has strong support not only from Democrats but also strong support from independents and moderate Republicans,\" McKean said last year. \"That's what we need if we're going to be winning in November.\"\n\nVoter guide: Don\u2019t have a lot of time?

Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and former U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke ended their campaigns.\n\nIowa Democratic Reps. Chris Hall of Sioux City, who backed O\u2019Rourke; Monica Kurth of Davenport, who backed Booker; and Ross Wilburn of Ames, who supported Harris; all recently endorsed Klobuchar.\n\nDespite the bevy of endorsements, Klobuchar has lagged behind four frontrunners \u2014 U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren; former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 in the months before the caucuses.\n\nShe was in fifth place in a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll in November and January, with 6% of likely Democratic caucusgoers naming her their first choice in each poll.\n\nIowa caucus:10 questions that will be answered on caucus night\n\nShe also has struggled to appeal to young Iowans. In the early January Iowa Poll, she gained favorable ratings with older likely Democratic caucusgoers, including 69% of women age 55 and older.\n\nBut just 32% of caucusgoers younger than 35 said they view her favorably.\n\nWhen the impeachment trial kept Klobuchar in Washington, she deployed her husband, John; and daughter Abigail Bessler; Minnesota politicians; and U.S. Olympic gold medal curling coach Phill Drobnick; to Iowa on her behalf.\n\nIn the past two weeks, she hosted three tele-town halls that reached more than 35,000 Iowans, her campaign manager, Justin Buoen, said last week at a Bloomberg News reporter roundtable in Des Moines.\n\nAs Klobuchar sat in the impeachment trial Monday morning, her husband and daughter listened to the closing arguments on the radio while delivering glazed donuts to canvassers in Des Moines.\n\n\"The last push here is to get people out to the caucuses,\" John Bessler told reporters Monday.\n\nHe predicted that \"the fact that Amy showed up\" in rural counties will make her viable in smaller precincts across the state, which is critical to picking up state delegate equivalents.\n\n\"We're putting hangers on doorknobs, we're making phone calls, we're doing all the things you'd expect in the last stage of the campaign here in Iowa,\" he said. \"I'm going to do whatever they ask me to do!\"\n\nIn a year of campaigning in Iowa, Klobuchar lived out the title of her memoir, \"The Senator Next Door.\" She brought her favorite hotdish across the border, celebrated Thanksgiving in Des Moines, and repeatedly joked that she \"can see Iowa from my porch.\"\n\nSome Iowans she met during marathon bus tours became part of her stump speeches and debate rebuttals.\n\nIn October in Crawfordsville, Klobuchar mournfully scanned a rack of navy blue work uniforms at W2 Fuel, a closed biofuels plant, reading aloud the names of the laid-off workers embroidered on the shirts.\n\nShe recited them \u2014 \"Derek, Mark, Salvador\" \u2014 three months later at the debate in Des Moines while criticizing the Trump administration for granting waivers to large oil companies that exempt them from ethanol mandates.\n\n\"I am going to be able to stand across from (Trump) on that debate stage and say to my friends in Iowa, 'The Midwest is not flyover country for me; I live here,'\" Klobuchar said in January. \"I'm going to be able to look at him and say, \u2018You've treated these workers and farmers like poker chips. For me, these are my friends, and these are my neighbors.'\"\n\nCandidates on the issues: Find out how the 2020 presidential candidates plan to tackle healthcare, climate change, gun violence and more.\n\nShelby Fleig covers Des Moines' western suburbs for the Register.
