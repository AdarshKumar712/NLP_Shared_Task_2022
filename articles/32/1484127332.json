She noticed him from the moment that he sat down, Arreola said.\n\nHoliday Sale! Get an annual digital subscription for only $20. Act before it's gone!

Bevering said. The gunman died at the scene, Bevering said.\n\nArreola said she could tell that one of the members of the security team was concerned about the shooter because he sat in the back right near him.\n\n\u201cThey saved us,\u201d Arreola said. \u201cUnfortunately, two men lost their lives while they were doing so.\u201d\n\nArreola said she couldn\u2019t concentrate when the man was sitting behind her.\n\n\u201cI should have listened to my gut,\u201d Arreola said. \u201cWhile he was there, I couldn\u2019t sing. I couldn\u2019t pray. There was just something not right about him. But at the same time, I thought that maybe I was being too hard.\u201d\n\nArreola said that she wanted to provide a good example for her young daughter. The 7-year-old is now asking questions that neither one of her parents can answer.\n\n\u201cWhy did he do this? Why are people so mean?\u201d Arreola said her daughter has asked.\n\nShe has no answers.\n\n\u201cOur church is so giving,\u201dArreola said. \u201cWe help the homeless. We help people get food, pay for car repairs. If he just needed something, I\u2019m sure we would have tried to help him if he had just asked.\u201d\n\nThe church has planned a members-only worship service for Monday. Perhaps Arreola or her husband will attend, but she does not believe her daughter will be able to make it. She is still processing the shooting, Arreola said. If not Monday, her family will return to her church soon, Arreola said.\n\n\u201cThe church is my family,\u201d she said. \u201cI pray to God that he watches over us and we can put this in the past. You hear about church shootings, school shootings all the time, but never think that it\u2019ll be your church.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["shooting", "texas", "church", "dead", "death", "fort worth", "white settlement", "gun", "shot", "police"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A woman said the shooter who killed two people during a service at the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, TX, near Fort Worth appeared to be in a disguise, wearing a fake-looking beard and hair.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.star-telegram.com/wps/source/images/star-telegram/apple-touch-icon-144-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wps/build/images/star-telegram/windowsmetro-144.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "startelegram", "title": "\u2018There was just something not right about him,\u2019 says woman who sat near church gunman", "description": "A woman said the shooter who killed two people during a service at the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, TX, near Fort Worth appeared to be in a disguise, wearing a fake-looking beard and hair.", "image": "https://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/me8vru/picture238810993/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Church%20shooting%20screen%20grab.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "star-telegram", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018There was just something not right about him,\u2019 says woman who sat near church gunman", "url": "https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/crime/article238818513.html", "description": "A woman said the shooter who killed two people during a service at the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, TX, near Fort Worth appeared to be in a disguise, wearing a fake-looking beard and hair.", "image": "https://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/me8vru/picture238810993/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Church%20shooting%20screen%20grab.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 155812681283151, "pages": 17636558529}, "title": "Texas church shooting witness says gunman made her nervous | Fort Worth Star-Telegram", "allow-comments": "true", "description": "A woman said the shooter who killed two people during a service at the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, TX, near Fort Worth appeared to be in a disguise, wearing a fake-looking beard and hair.", "keywords": "shooting, texas, church, dead, death, fort worth, white settlement, gun, shot, police", "news_keywords": "shooting, texas, church, dead, death, fort worth, white settlement, gun, shot, police", "googlebot": "noodp, noarchive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "original-source": "https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/crime/article238818513.html", "google-site-verification": "zLQTVtfwr_FaFe6A7f-Yxjz2dhOn4VTFy87suqUWDLo", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=389708740, affiliate-data=at=1010lHsN&ct=SmartAppBannerFTW, app-argument=https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/crime/article238818513.html?appNav=smartBanner", "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"article_id\": \"238818513\"}"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/crime/article238818513.html"}
