Chief Carl Besanceney.\n\nIn a Facebook post, the Torrance Fire Department made a public plea for a plasma donation to help an engineer, whose family asked for privacy, who is recovering from COVID-19.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, he needs plasma donated from a fully recovered COVID patient so their antibodies may help boost his ability to fight back,\u201d the department said in the Facebook post.\n\nPlasma from once-infected patients contains antibodies that helped their immune system attack the virus when they were sick. Once recovered, their plasma may then be able to help others, like the firefighter, fight off the disease.\n\nThe plasma is being used to treat patients with serious or life-threatening infections.\n\n\u201cHis wife did an outreach yesterday afternoon to us and said they had gone through a number of plasma donors that didn\u2019t match what was needed,\u201d said Besanceney.\n\nThe firefighter\u2019s department said ever since the message got out, they\u2019ve been getting a huge response from people who want to help. So they decided to redirect and broaden their outreach.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get help for our Torrance Fire family but more importantly, for the patients across the board,\u201d Besanceney said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to streamline the process for doctors, nurses and medical facilities staff to be able to grab that information and do a match quicker.\u201d\n\nThe Torrance Fire Department is now working with the American Red Cross to find people who can donate their plasma.\n\nBesanceney hopes the public will do what they can to help their firefighter and so many others beat COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe really need this outreach for everyone across the nation to be able to benefit from them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe donor must meet several criteria:\n\nTo qualify, the donor must have tested positive for COVID-19 and already been recovered with symptoms resolved at least 28 days prior to the donation or 14 days prior to donation with a second negative COVID test. The donor should be male, or a female who has never been pregnant or who has been tested since their most recent pregnancy and results interpreted as negative for HLA antibodies.\n\nAnyone who fits the criteria may contact Dr. Marc Cohen at emsdoc911@hotmail.com or visit the American Red Cross website.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["coronavirus", "coronavirus plasma donation", "plasma donation", "torrance", "torrance firefighter", "torrance news"], "tags": ["Coronavirus Plasma Donation", "Torrance News", "Plasma Donation", "Torrance", "Coronavirus", "Torrance Firefighter"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Apr 15 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "In a Facebook post, the Torrance Fire Department made a public plea for a plasma donation to help an unidentified engineer who is recovering from COVID-19.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/06/cropped-la-favicon-512.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"keywords": "coronavirus, coronavirus plasma donation, plasma donation, torrance, torrance firefighter, torrance news", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "fb": {"pages": 57972945858}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "og": {"title": "Torrance Fire Department Asks For Plasma Donation To Help Engineer Recover From COVID-19", "image": {"identifier": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2020/04/GettyImages-1209562496.jpg?w=1500", "secure_url": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2020/04/GettyImages-1209562496.jpg?w=1500", "width": 1500, "height": 1033}, "description": "In a Facebook post, the Torrance Fire Department made a public plea for a plasma donation to help an unidentified engineer who is recovering from COVID-19.", "type": "article", "url": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/04/15/coronavirus-torrance-fire-plasma-donation-engineer-recovering-covid-19/", "category": "Coronavirus,Local,Los Angeles News,News,Syndicated Local"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-04-15T17:19:23+00:00", "suggested-social-copy": "In a Facebook post, the Torrance Fire Department made a public plea for a plasma donation to help an unidentified engineer who is recovering from COVID-19.", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2020/04/GettyImages-1209562496.jpg?w=1500", "title": "Torrance Fire Department Asks For Plasma Donation To Help Engineer Recover From COVID-19", "description": "In a Facebook post, the Torrance Fire Department made a public plea for a plasma donation to help an unidentified engineer who is recovering from COVID-19.", "site": "CBSLA"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/06/cropped-la-favicon-512.png?w=270", "description": "In a Facebook post, the Torrance Fire Department made a public plea for a plasma donation to help an unidentified engineer who is recovering from COVID-19."}, "canonical_link": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/04/15/coronavirus-torrance-fire-plasma-donation-engineer-recovering-covid-19/"}
