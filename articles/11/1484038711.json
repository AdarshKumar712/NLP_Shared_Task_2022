She wolfed down mussels, clams and Dungeness crab while looking straight into a camera that was filming for her YouTube channel.\n\n\u201cOh my God, the garlic, it\u2019s so yummy. Lots of places don\u2019t marinate it right and they don\u2019t give you this much sauce,\u201d she gushed, on cue. \u201cMy mouth is definitely on fire.\u201d\n\nIn her junior year, the 25-year-old left UC Riverside, where she was studying business, to become one of the few Chinese American competitive food eaters in the U.S. At 5-feet-7 and 135 pounds, she once polished off a 4-pound burrito in six minutes and for a recent promotion devoured 100 chicken wings.\n\nInitially, her foreign-born father worried that his daughter was losing the chance at a well-paying, prestigious career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Huang\u2019s risky move earned her entrance to the newly founded Asian Hustle Network, a California-based support group and social hub for young Asian American professionals and serial entrepreneurs across the globe, many of whom are children of immigrants who toiled at multiple, more conventional jobs to give their kids a shot at stable lives.\n\nCompetitive eater and YouTuber Raina Huang photographs food and drink as she prepares to eat 10lbs of seafood at The Crab Shack while filming an episode for her channel in La Habra. (Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times)\n\nHer new gig as a competitive eater and social media influencer \u2014 she\u2019s the star of 600-plus videos \u2014 finally has won her father\u2019s approval.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually surprised with her character right now, once I got used to her choice,\u201d Wil Huang, an IT engineer, said about his eldest daughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuang, who hails from mainland China, described himself and his wife as \u201cmore traditional,\u201d adding that he intends to teach Raina\u2019s younger sister, who\u2019s studying pharmacology, \u201cto work 8 to 5 in a corporation or some research firm, simply to do a regular job.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut with Raina, we accept that she can handle it,\u201d he said. \u201cI told her if this is what you choose, you need to find a way to survive \u2014 and she actually did. She is strategic.\u201d\n\nBryan Pham, who started the Asian Hustle Network on Facebook with Maggie Chui, the founder of Prism Apparel, said that diversity in background and profession is what makes members stand out.\n\nHe had gone to a start-up event at UC Berkeley and wondered why there was no online network just for Asian professionals. \u201cWe wanted a network where we can lift each other up, share resources, make an impact. I knew that we could be stronger together.\u201d\n\nPham\u2019s mother, Lai Vuong, reminds her son about the sacrifices that the family made in order for him to succeed.\n\n\u201cLike many Asian parents, we worked endless hours to prove to our children what it takes to achieve and we went without so they could have what they need,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think Vietnamese elders have the luxury to just sit and relax? I know the elders can be unreasonable. We don\u2019t explain why our children need to be doctors and lawyers. We just know that having lived in wartime, we want what is safe, what will protect them when there is crisis. The money you earn in those careers is your protection.\u201d\n\nWhen the network launched on Nov. 8 it immediately resonated with self-styled doers, investors, inventors and all manner of entrepreneurs going against the norm who flocked to the group\u2019s Facebook page and invited hundreds of their friends to join in. That momentum has helped the network surge to more than 13,000 members. Pham, Chui and group moderators aim to hit the 1-million mark.\n\nBryan Pham and Maggie Chui co-founded the Asian Hustle Network, a Facebook group that aspires to reach 1 million Asian American professionals around the world. (Angelina Hong)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group boasts chief executives, chief financial officers, some people who were temporarily homeless before cashing in on success and other people with polished resumes listing MBAs, PhDs, Ivy League educations, expertise in such industries as real estate, import-export and multinational financing, or work for Fortune 500 companies.\n\nOne member reminisced online about living the sweet life with his cookies that were chosen by Business Insider as Best Chocolate Chip Cookie in California. Others have posted about their high-level promotions in Silicon Valley or winning on \u201cShark Tank\u201d or delivering TED talks.\n\nLinda Nguyen, president-elect of the Asian American Business Assn. of Orange County and a new AHN member, said that the difference between this group and other business associations is \u201cthe difference between old world and new world thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis network is not just for referrals \u2014 we talk about vulnerabilities, about failures that lead to success. It\u2019s almost confessional,\u201d Nguyen said.\n\n\u201cPeople around the world share about the time when they totally crash and burn and how they dug themselves out,\u201d she added, \u201cand during this moment, when mental wellness is at the forefront of society, this process can help relieve the loneliness of doing business.\u201d\n\nRegina \u201cPush\u201d Estrada, the Filipina American behind Gold Leaf Ink, an upscale tattoo studio in San Francisco, said that group members\u2019 \u201cexperiments, failures and success give us a lesson to learn.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all looking for our own niche and this network has really hit on something that never was available before,\u201d she said. \u201cIn this space, we can be ourselves and express ourselves \u2014 without judgment.\u201d\n\nGroup co-founder Pham grew up in the San Gabriel Valley watching his Vietnamese American parents run Tony\u2019s Appliances and never take vacations. At 30, he\u2019s based in the Bay Area and has moved beyond a software engineering background into property investment and working as director of strategic partnerships at Startup Grind Berkeley, where he unites start-up communities and helps them get funding. He also has a podcast, \u201cCrushing It in Real Estate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome Asian Americans, he said, \u201cbelieve there\u2019s a bamboo ceiling over their heads, that they can\u2019t achieve on their own or are stifled by what their parents expect of them.\u201d He pays his parents\u2019 monthly mortgage on their Temple City home.\n\nPart of Pham\u2019s motivation is knowing that Asian Americans \u201caren\u2019t well represented at all, especially in the majority of executive seats around America.\u201d But by combining forces within the network, he believes, that can change.\n\n\u201cWe can build on each other\u2019s connections, we can seed entrepreneurs, we can boost mentorship. Ultimately, we can be billionaires. We can hustle.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneur Lisa Song Sutton, 34, would agree. The Arizona native, daughter of a Korean mother and a white father, followed the traditional path, enrolling in law school at the University of Miami, then working in a firm focusing on business litigation.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a matter of me going to college \u2014 it was, \u2018Which graduate school will you enter?\u2019\u201d she recalled of the expectations that surrounded her. \u201cWe always talked about goals.\u201d\n\nSutton kept practicing law, even after being crowned Miss Nevada in 2014, becoming the first person of Asian descent to win the title that led to more than 500 community appearances and a TEDX talk on building community.\n\nAlong the way, she and close friend Dannielle Cole teamed up to open Sin City Cupcakes. Their alcohol-laced desserts became so popular that they garnered business from vendors exhibiting at Las Vegas\u2019 famed Consumer Electronics Show; Twitter placed an order for 2,000 treats. The women\u2019s bakery has expanded to Dallas and they\u2019re eyeing a third branch in Southern California.\n\n\u201cWhen I think of hustle, I think of grit, that mental toughness, that moment when you get up and do the work on the day you don\u2019t want to do it. The strength of the people in this network symbolizes that,\u201d Sutton said.\n\nYouTuber Raina Huang and Jun Chai look at the shells left over after Huang ate 10lbs of seafood at The Crab Shack while filming an episode for her channel. (Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times)\n\nTo Huang, the network is vital to her career because it has attracted countless members fronting food or restaurant investments, forming an ever-expanding pool of clients for her to tap.\n\nShe said that eating competitively has allowed her to better understand nutrition and propelled her travel to 15 states, along with Spain and Taiwan. Recently, she headed to Hawaii, where she had appearances at a pancake house, two burger hotspots and an eatery known for loco moco, a Hawaiian dish.\n\nCome 2020, she\u2019s hitting the Southern U.S. and Japan. She has plans to diversify her repertoire with travel videos.\n\n\u201cI ate a lot all my life, but I really didn\u2019t know about food challenges since it\u2019s not really visible in Chinese culture,\u201d she said.\n\nHer father worries for her health. But after discussing her career with his Chinese friends, he realized that internet celebrities are increasingly a thing \u201cin our homeland. For some reason, they broadcast wherever they go and people are fascinated.\u201d\n\n\u201cRaina is smart,\u201d he said. \u201cAsian parents have to realize it\u2019s not just grades.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Things to Do"], "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Anh Do Is A Metro Reporter Covering Asian American Issues", "Orange County.
