The Washington Department of Ecology had projected that Washington's air quality would improve enough by 2020 to end the program, which started in 1982.\n\nFive counties currently require emissions testing: Clark, King, Pierce, Snohomish, and Spokane Counties.\n\nLast year, approximately 750,000 vehicles required testing. That number is down from 1.2 million a few years prior.\n\n\u201cWhen we began the emission check program back in 1982, air pollution from carbon monoxide and ozone was a serious concern in many of our biggest cities,\u201d said Kathy Taylor, the manager of the Air Quality program for the Washington Department of Ecology. \u201cToday, new cars are much, much cleaner than in decades past, which means we can continue to improve our state\u2019s air quality without these regular tests.\u201d\n\nOfficials stress this verdict will not hinder Washington\u2019s fight against climate change, which focused on carbon monoxide emissions.\n\nCarbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses that face a greater threat to the environment were not tested.\n\nVehicles remain the largest source of carbon pollution in Washington. Supporting zero-emission vehicles through Washington\u2019s clean car standards and advocating for public transit are among ways state officials have been addressing the ongoing problem of pollution.\n\nEnding the program will affect about 180 people who work for Applus, the contractor that operates testing stations. About a dozen employees at the Department of Ecology and several independent testing and repair stations will be impacted by the program's end.\n\nAdministrators have been working with the employees to prepare for the shutdown and help them find other positions.\n\nRELATED: Inslee focuses on transportation in next stage of climate fight\n\nRELATED: Sharp cuts in greenhouse gas emissions needed now to meet climate goal, UN warns", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Author", "King Staff", "Published", "Pm Pst December", "Updated", "Am Pst January"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 01:35:46 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Vehicles in the state of Washington will no longer be required to pass a clean emissions test in order to renew registration.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/content/favicon/KREM.png?version=3.22.6", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1170", "site": "krem.com", "fb": {"app_id": 194226194463682}, "og": {"site_name": "KREM", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.krem.com/article/news/emissions-testing-in-wa-comes-to-an-end-after-38-years/281-4a743d00-7573-4809-9933-83280851ccb5", "title": "Washington ends vehicle emissions testing on Jan. 1", "description": "Vehicles in the state of Washington will no longer be required to pass a clean emissions test in order to renew registration.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.krem.com/assets/KING/images/1f05ae59-c451-4319-93fa-b20d82834a26/1f05ae59-c451-4319-93fa-b20d82834a26_1140x641.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "12/31/2019 1:35:46 AM"}}, "description": "Vehicles in the state of Washington will no longer be required to pass a clean emissions test in order to renew registration.", "category": "news", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"title": "Washington ends vehicle emissions testing on Jan. 1", "image": {"src": "https://media.krem.com/assets/KING/images/1f05ae59-c451-4319-93fa-b20d82834a26/1f05ae59-c451-4319-93fa-b20d82834a26_360x203.jpg"}, "card": "summary", "site": "KREM2", "description": "Vehicles in the state of Washington will no longer be required to pass a clean emissions test in order to renew registration.", "domain": "www.krem.com"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/emissions-testing-in-wa-comes-to-an-end-after-38-years/281-4a743d00-7573-4809-9933-83280851ccb5"}
