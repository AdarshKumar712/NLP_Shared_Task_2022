Voestalpine\u2019s steelworks blast furnace is now the country\u2019s number one CO2 emitter, said Dave Jones, an analyst at climate think-tank Ember.\n\nReally good news! But Austria is nowhere close to coal-free\u2026@Voestalpine's Linz coal blast furnace steelworks is\n\nAustria's #1 CO2 emitter, biggest EU steel emitter, and #12 biggest total emitter in EU. We also need a pathway to coal-free steel\u2026 https://t.co/yOPRnLymFp \u2014 Dave Jones (@CoalFreeDave) April 17, 2020\n\nSeven more countries are expected to follow suit by 2025, including France (2022), Sweden (2022), Slovakia (2023), Portugal (2023), the UK (2024), Ireland (2025) and Italy (2025), according to Europe Beyond Coal.\n\nThey will be followed by Greece (2028), the Netherlands (2029), Finland (2029), Hungary (2030), and Denmark (2030).\n\nAnd discussions are currently underway in the Czech Republic, Spain and North Macedonia about when to exit coal-fired electricity.\n\nGermany has announced it will put its last coal plant offline by 2038, a commitment that still has to become official with the country\u2019s coal exit law.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic]", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Apr 20 08:27:02 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Austria officially closed its last coal-fired power plant on Friday (17 April), becoming the second EU country to exit coal after Belgium in 2016.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/themes/euractiv_com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "wp-parsely_version": "2.0", "robots": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot-news": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Austria officially closed its last coal-fired power plant on Friday (17 April), becoming the second EU country to exit coal after Belgium in 2016.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Austria becomes second EU country to exit coal", "description": "Austria officially closed its last coal-fired power plant on Friday (17 April), becoming the second EU country to exit coal after Belgium in 2016.", "image": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/Global2000-800x450.jpg"}, "og": {"title": "Austria becomes second EU country to exit coal", "url": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/electricity/news/austria-becomes-second-eu-country-to-exit-coal/", "type": "article", "site_name": "www.euractiv.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/Global2000-800x450.jpg", "alt": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/electricity/news/austria-becomes-second-eu-country-to-exit-coal/"}, "description": "Austria officially closed its last coal-fired power plant on Friday (17 April), becoming the second EU country to exit coal after Belgium in 2016."}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-04-20 08:27:02", "author": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Simon", "section": "Energy & Environment", "tag": "coal phase-out"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/ea_favicon_16x16.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/electricity/news/austria-becomes-second-eu-country-to-exit-coal/"}
