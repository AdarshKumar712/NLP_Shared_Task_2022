K-RERA is designed to prevent such malpractices in Kerala.\n\nRealtors who function in a lawful manner will not find themselves inconvenienced by RERA, Mr. Vijayan said.\n\nThe real estate sector is integral to the development of land. Negative financial trends in real estate affects the economic sector as a whole.\n\nIf policies are favourable, the sector can grow. So it is important to have policies and approaches that do not weaken it.\n\nWhile the sector has witnessed spectacular growth in the past few decades, the absence of an effective regulatory mechanism was the main reason for the problems associated with real estate sector.\n\n\u201cThis is not a sector which should be equated to a \u2018mafia\u2019,\u201d the Chief Minister said.\n\nFrom Oct. 2019\n\nTechnically, K-RERA came into being in October last year with P.H. Kurian as chairman and Preetha P. Menon as member. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, makes it compulsory for builders to register projects with the State-level RERA.\n\nReal estate agents also need to get themselves with the authority. RERA registration is applicable to projects where the land to be developed is 500 square metres or more and the number of apartments is eight or more inclusive of all phases.\n\nAn adjudicating officer who will handle compensation claims and an appellate tribunal for handling appeals on K-RERA decisions will be appointed soon, the Chief Minister said. He issued the registration certificates to builders and real estate agents who registered with RERA. The Chief Minister also released the emblem of K-RERA on the occasion. Minister for Local Self Government A. C. Moideen presided. Additional Chief Secretary T.K. Jose, K-RERA chairman P. H. Kurian and member Preetha P. Menon spoke.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Kerala", "gadgets (general)", "police", "space programme", "Fact Check", "constitution", "university", "Tamil cinema", "The Hindu Explains", "population and census", "Citizenship Amendment Act"], "authors": ["V.M.
