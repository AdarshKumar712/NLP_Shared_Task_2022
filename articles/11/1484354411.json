I'm still monitoring a lot of my work, a lot that I'm going through.\n\n\"I kind of pace myself in the right way. I'm not in a rush, which is also a good thing.\" The shoulder problem was Dimitrov's first major injury and he said he plans to limit the number of tournaments he plays, particularly early in the season.\n\n\"I'm not going to force myself to play too many tournaments early on and really look after the body. That's the number one thing,\" said Dimitrov, now ranked 20.\n\n\"Clearly I haven't competed for almost the past four months of the year, and so that itself brought a lot of doubts, and dropping a lot in the ranking and so on.\n\n\"But at the same time, I was able to kind of recover as quick as possible, and hopefully now I'm at a place that can only get better. I'm really going to focus on that.\"\n\n\n\nHe is not only playing for Bulgaria at the ATP Cup, but captaining the team, a new experience that he is relishing.\n\n\"It's challenging, no doubt about it,\" he said.\n\n\"It's always been a dream of mine to always be kind of on the other end, and I think to be a coach is never easy.\n\n\"I don't know if I'm going to be a good coach. I can only share my experience, my thoughts with the guys.\"\n\n\n\nThe ATP Cup, which starts Friday, features 24 nations split into six groups across Sydney, Brisbane and Perth, with eight of them emerging from the round-robin to compete in the knockout phase.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Grigor Dimitrov", "Tennis players", "Summer Olympic Games", "Tennis", "Dimitrov", "Grigor", "Perth", "the Australian Open", "coach", "Brisbane", "tennis", "injury", "Bulgaria", "Sydney", "good coach", "Paris", "the US Open", "shoulder injury"], "tags": ["Sports"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Read more about Dimitrov to ease his way back after injury-hit 2019 on Business Standard.
