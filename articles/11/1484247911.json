But it\u2019s a good way to start the year,\u201d Cassie said as she cradled her newborn, Paige, in the maternity wing of Charlton Memorial Hospital.\n\nAt 6 lbs, 11 ounces and 19 inches long, Paige came into the world at 8:14 a.m. on New Year's Day, making her the first baby born at the Fall River hospital this year, and this decade.\n\nCassie\u2019s due date was Jan. 2, she said. But at a doctor\u2019s appointment on Tuesday, she was told her first child may make an entrance as early as that very evening. So the couple stayed close to home.\n\n\u201cMy doctor said, 'You\u2019re probably going to go tonight or tomorrow,' so we just kind of hung at the house with the dog. I was literally playing fetch with the dog while having contractions,\u201d she said.\n\nPaige\u2019s arrival on New Year's Day may not have come as a surprise. But one big unknown remained until the moment their child was born \u2014 whether they were having a boy or girl. The couple, who have been together for 15 years, came to the hospital prepared with a list of possible baby names.\n\n\u201cWe finally just decided on Paige five minutes ago,\u201d Cassie said at about 3 p.m. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what we were having. It was a surprise. And we were in agreement that we wouldn\u2019t pick it until we met them, and figure it out from there.\u201d\n\nCassie and Kyle met when they were students at Ponaganset High School in Rhode Island. They married seven years ago and moved into a lakeside house in Smithfield, said Cassie.\n\n\u201cWe had our careers, and got our home, and finally we got to the point where we said it\u2019s time for the next step,\u201d said Cassie, who works as an education sales representative.\n\nKyle marveled at how alert his newborn was just a few hours after birth, and Cassie pointed out the resemblance her daughter bears to her husband.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so funny, in the ultrasounds we thought she looked like me, but when she came out she looked like you,\u201d she told Kyle.\n\nPaige\u2019s eyes grew heavy, fluttering open shut, and her was head wrapped in a bow like a present.\n\nAsked what she\u2019s looking forward to the most during the decade to come, Cassie said, \u201ceverything, all the experiences of having a kid.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur lives are completely different and changed,\u201d she said.\n\n\"It's a new normal. Ready or not, here she is. It's going to be a busy 2020.\" Kyle said with a smile.\n\nEmail Amanda Burke at aburke@heraldnews.com.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Amanda Burke"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "FALL RIVER\u00a0\u2014 As the clock struck midnight and a new decade began, Cassie and Kyle Lapati were in their car, driving from their home in Smithfield, Rhode Island, to Charlton Memorial Hospital for the birth of their daughter. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to see the ball drop.
