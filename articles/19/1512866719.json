He had visited Wuhan last month.\n\nHong Kong has been particularly on edge over the virus as it has revived memories of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03, which killed nearly 300 people in the financial hub and 349 people in the mainland.\n\nWith more than 20,400 confirmed infections in China, the mortality rate for the new coronavirus is much lower than the 9.6 per cent rate for SARS.\n\nThe virus has so far spread to more than 20 countries, prompting the World Health Organisation to declare a global health emergency, several governments to institute travel restrictions, and airlines to suspend flights to and from China.\n\nOn Sunday the Philippines reported the death of a Chinese man who had come from Wuhan \u2014 the first outside China.\n\n\u2018Shortcomings and difficulties\u2019\n\nChina\u2019s Communist leadership made a rare admission of fallibility on Monday as it acknowledged \u201cshortcomings and difficulties exposed in the response to the epidemic\u201d.\n\nThe elite Politburo Standing Committee called for improvements to the \u201cnational emergency management system\u201d at the meeting, according to the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to strengthen market supervision, resolutely ban and severely crack down on illegal wildlife markets and trade,\u201d the Politburo said.\n\nThe government also said it \u201curgently\u201d needed medical equipment such as surgical masks, protective suits and safety goggles as it battles to control the outbreak.\n\nMost of the deaths have been in Wuhan and the rest of surrounding Hubei province, which has largely been under lockdown for almost two weeks.\n\nA 1,000-bed field hospital in Wuhan built from scratch within two weeks to relieve overburdened medical facilities started receiving patients on Tuesday.\n\nA second makeshift hospital is due to open later this week.\n\nEconomic woes\n\nGlobal fears about the virus have risen, with cruise lines worldwide expected to deny boarding to passengers and crew who have recently travelled to China.\n\nJapan has quarantined a cruise ship carrying 3,711 people and was testing those on board for the new coronavirus Tuesday, after a former passenger was diagnosed with the illness in Hong Kong.\n\nMacau, China\u2019s semi-autonomous gambling hub, decided to temporarily close all of its casinos for at least two weeks.\n\nThe virus is also taking an increasing economic toll, shutting down businesses across China, curbing international travel and impacting production lines of major global brands.\n\nThe government extended the Lunar New Year holiday by three days in an effort to keep people indoors.\n\nBut many provinces and major cities \u2014 including Shanghai \u2014 have called on companies to remain closed for an extra week. Schools and universities have delayed the start of new terms.\n\nThe Shanghai stock market plunged almost eight per cent on Monday on the first day of trading since the holiday, but shares were on the rise by midday on Tuesday.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["World"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Feb  4 12:31:07 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/wp-content/plugins/pwa-for-wp/images/logo.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Coronavirus: Death toll climbs over 400 in China - Daily Times", "description": "The death toll from\u00a0coronavirus climbed to over 400 after 64 more people died, the biggest single day tally since the first fatalities emerged last month.
