Jagan Mohan Reddy at a meeting in November.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to ready a solution. The Andhra Pradesh government has been offered sweeteners,\" a senior Union government official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nQueries emailed to the spokespeople of NTPC and the Union ministry of new and renewable energy on Tuesday evening remained unanswered.\n\nAndhra has India\u2019s second-largest installed capacity of clean energy, accounting for around 10% of the country\u2019s renewable energy capacity, with investments of around \u20b960,000 crore.\n\nState energy secretary N. Srikanth confirmed the development. \u201cWe are yet to receive a formal proposal. Once we get it we will take a decision,\" he said.\n\nThe state has around 7,700MW of solar and wind power projects. It has 4,092MW of installed wind power projects awarded through feed-in tariffs, and 3,230MW of solar power projects awarded through competitive bidding. Andhra owes \u20b920,000 crore to all power generators in unpaid bills.\n\nNTPC plans to use the electricity bought from Andhra Pradesh to bundle it with power generated from its stations to bring tariffs down.\n\nAccording to government documents reviewed by Mint, \u201cNTPC may buy renewable power from Andhra Pradesh for bundling scheme of government of India at an appropriate price.\"\n\nThe Union government has been trying to seek a solution to the issue, given that marquee investors such as Goldman Sachs, Brookfield, SoftBank and World Bank\u2019s International Finance Corp. have invested in the state\u2019s clean energy projects. Mint reported on 29 November about a compromise formula struck during a meeting attended by Union and state government representatives on 7 November. However, the hard-fought compromise floundered.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["NTPC", "Andhra Pradesh", "renewable energy contracts", "power purchase agreements", "overseas investments", "NTPC Chief", "Gurdeep Singh", "Y.S.
