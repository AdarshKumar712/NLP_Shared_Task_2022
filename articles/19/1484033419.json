(The NEWS \u2013 files) Winter tires must be in good condition with a minimum tread depth of 3.5 millimetres, and must be used on designated highways from Oct. 1 to March 31.\n\nRCMP and ICBC are asking drivers to prepare for and slow down in winter driving conditions.\n\nEach year in the Lower Mainland, the number of casualty crashes due to driving too fast for the conditions increases by 17 per cent in December compared to October, according to ICBC.\n\nThe information is based on police-data from 2014 to 2018 and defines a casualty crash as one in which at least one person is killed or injured.\n\nREAD MORE: Nearly half of B.C. drivers nervous in winter conditions: BCAA\n\nThe owner of Big O Tires in Maple Ridge said, ideally, drivers would have started preparing for winter driving conditions in late October.\n\n\u201cWinter tires are recommended as soon as it gets below 7 C,\u201d said Bill King. \u201cThe reason for that is that all-season tires tend to harden up and become more slippery, while winter tires are a soft rubber compound, so they get better traction in the cold weather.\u201d\n\nThe type of tire required for a given vehicle varies.\n\nBut in B.C., winter tires are defined as those with either the mountain snowflake symbol or the one with mud and snow, according to the RCMP.\n\nWinter tires must be in good condition with a minimum tread depth of 3.5 millimetres, and must be used on designated highways from Oct. 1 to March 31, the police authority noted.\n\nDrivers should keeping vehicle tires properly inflated to avoid irregular wear and prolong tread life.\n\nREAD MORE: B.C. truck drivers to face higher fines for not using winter tire chains\n\nLarge trucks are also required to carry chains in the province.\n\nKing also recommends getting your vehicle\u2019s battery inspected. The cooler the weather the more difficult it is to turn the engine, he said.\n\n\u201cWith windshield wipers, it\u2019s pretty much evident as soon as you turn them on if they\u2019re not doing the job, if they need to be replaced, King added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big cost item, but it\u2019s nice to see where you are going.\u201d\n\nICBC is reminding drivers to clear off any snow from their vehicle before driving, including from their headlights. Headlights and taillights should be on in poor weather conditions when there\u2019s often reduced visibility.\n\nThe crown corporation asks drivers to be aware of black ice when temperatures are near freezing. Black ice is commonly found in shaded areas, bridges, overpasses and intersections, according to its website. Slow down and keep a distance from motor vehicles.\n\nIn severe winter weather, consider alternatives such as public transit, or carpool with someone who is equipped for the conditions. ICBC suggests leaving the car at home if it is not safe to drive.\n\n@JotiGrewal_\n\njoti.grewal@blackpress.ca\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Ridge Meadows Flames", "Celebrations of Life", "Maple Ridge Burrards", "PJHL"], "authors": ["Joti Grewal", "Local News"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 06:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Casualty crashes due to driving too fast for the conditions increase in December, ICBC reports", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://1wn3pg4fh5uh2dktoa28c8c9-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/BlackPress/assets/images/icons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "gpsid": 19973230, "generator": "AMP for WP 0.9.98.2", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Maple Ridge News", "url": "https://www.mapleridgenews.com/news/how-to-prepare-for-winter-driving-conditions-in-maple-ridge/", "title": "How to prepare for winter driving conditions in Maple Ridge - Maple Ridge News", "description": "Casualty crashes due to driving too fast for the conditions increase in December, ICBC reports", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.mapleridgenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19973230_web1_Winter-road-driving-Metrocrop-1024x683.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 683}, "secure_url": "https://www.mapleridgenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19973230_web1_Winter-road-driving-Metrocrop-1024x683.jpg"}, "description": "Casualty crashes due to driving too fast for the conditions increase in December, ICBC reports", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T06:00:00-08:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How to prepare for winter driving conditions in Maple Ridge - Maple Ridge News", "description": "Casualty crashes due to driving too fast for the conditions increase in December, ICBC reports", "image": "https://www.mapleridgenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19973230_web1_Winter-road-driving-Metrocrop-1024x683.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 134480989990227}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.mapleridgenews.com/news/how-to-prepare-for-winter-driving-conditions-in-maple-ridge/"}
