Lotto 6/49 was once again among the preferred tickets purchased by many Canadians, but it seemed like many of the cash prizes were eventually drawn to the eastern regions of the country.\n\nToday we are going to review some of the heftiest Lotto 6/49 jackpots bagged by Quebec players this year. Purchasing tickets as a group has made the entire gaming experience more special for Canadians, as it makes them feel part of a community that could soon become much richer. This is also true for tickets purchased by couples that have agreed to split the jackpot and invest it in something both individuals would find enjoyable.\n\nLotto 6/49 Proves Generosity\n\nSuch was the case with a couple hailing from Gatineau that became eligible for a cash windfall of CA$7 million mid-July. Just like many winners before them, the two Lotto 6/49 enthusiasts were in a state of disbelief upon realizing their lives would never be the same again. Colette Laberge and Mario Lafreni\u00e8re collected their jackpot and took a photo with the hefty cheque at Casino du Lac-Leamy.\n\nThe winging draw for the two of them took place on July 10, highlighting the numbers 07, 15, 22, 28, 43, 49, plus the bonus one 45. Matching the six main numbers sufficed, making their ticket a lucky one indeed. Winners revealed that they had purchased the winning ticket at Uniprix Danyel Dessureault, Place de la Cit\u00e9-des-Jeunes.\n\nAccording to Loto-Quebec\u2019s regulation, every retail point associated with a winning purchase is eligible for a 1-percent slice of the jackpot. This granted the location some CA$70,000, a motivation for many retailers to include lottery offerings in their array of offerings. One of the regular questions, when winners collect their prize, is related to their plans. The Gatineau couple had already come up with a plan that included treating their extended family as well.\n\nLarger Prizes Claimed\n\nAnother permanent resident of Quebec would forever remember this year as a special one thanks to his lucky Lotto 6/49 ticket purchase. The first days of August were special for Daniel Lavoie of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean who was the proud winner of CA$3.5 million jackpot. This was half of the August 7 Lotto 6/49 Main prize, but still a generous cash pile for the Canadian.\n\nAugust 7 brought a Lotto 6/49 draw coming with a CA$7-million prize that was eventually split between the two tickets eligible for it. The numbers drawn at that draw were 05, 08, 09, 19, 28, 31, plus the bonus one 18. Mr. Lavoie purchased his ticket at the Couche-Tard convenience store in Chambord ahead of the lucky draw.\n\nJust like every other retail location selling winging tickets, the convenience store received one percent of the payout. In this case this amounted to CA$35,000 piece of the Main prize. The lotto millionaire was certain that he would continue working at least for the time being, despite the windfall. He also began looking for the perfect new home for his family.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ged Itdun", "Daniel Negreanu"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Lotto 6/49 was once again among the preferred tickets purchased by many Canadians, but it seemed like many of the cash prizes went to Quebec", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.casinoreports.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Quebec Proved to Be Attractive Enough for Lotto Windfalls", "description": "Quebec lottery fans have celebrated quite the cash windfalls over the past twelve months, with bigger and better lotto jackpots making their way to their pockets.
