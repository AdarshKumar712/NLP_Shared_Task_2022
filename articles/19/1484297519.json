It's time for Congress to deliver meaningful privacy and security protections for the American public\u2026 I believe that just notice and consent are no longer enough. I don\u2019t think that transparency is the only solution.\u201d\n\nIn her remarks before the committee, Cantwell noted that American consumers still face privacy challenges from a range of different online practices.\n\n\u201cConsumers continue to see the challenges that they face with corporate practices that allow for collection, storage, analyzing, and monetizing their personal information,\u201d Cantwell continued. \u201cI hope we kick off a very substantive discussion to explore how we go about changing this mindset that treats personal information as a commodity for profit.\u201d\n\nCantwell also criticized efforts to pre-empt laws from states like Washington, which is considering adopting its own privacy protections, in any federal legislation that Congress may consider.\n\n\u201cI find this effort somewhat disturbing, that as our country is grappling with all the privacy violations we\u2019ve seen, the first thing people want to organize is a preemption effort,\u201d Cantwell said.\n\nSenator Cantwell has long advocated for more stringent protections for the privacy of American consumers, including when she questioned the CEO of Equifax on data breaches, when she questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and when she urged President Trump to veto a resolution passed by Congress to undo consumer privacy regulations adopted by the FCC.\n\nHere is VIDEO and AUDIO from Senator Cantwell\u2019s opening statement at today\u2019s hearing.\n\nHere is VIDEO and AUDIO from Senator Cantwell\u2019s Q&A with the witnesses at the hearing.\n\n###", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/themes/cantwell/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "date": "2019-02-27", "title": "Cantwell Calls for Comprehensive Privacy Protections for American Consumers; Transparency, Consent Alone Not Enough", "og": {"image": "https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/themes/cantwell/images/sharelogo.jpg", "title": "Cantwell Calls for Comprehensive Privacy Protections for American Consumers; Transparency, Consent Alone Not Enough | U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington", "description": "The Official U.S. Senate website of Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington"}}, "canonical_link": ""}
