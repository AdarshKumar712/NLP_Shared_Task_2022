The hold-up apparently has to do with the medical record on right-handed pitcher Brusdar Graterol, who is being dealt to the Red Sox.\n\nThe Athletic reported late Wednesday night that the trade \u2014 which will send Mookie Betts and David Price to the Dodgers \u2014 may be adjusted after further review of Graterol\u2019s medicals. According to the report, the Red Sox view Graterol more as a reliever than a starter, and may ask for an additional player and/or money, either from the Dodgers or Twins to complete the trade.\n\nThe 21-year-old Graterol missed more than two months last season due to a right shoulder impingement, but returned to make his big-league debut and he made 10 appearances for the Twins, all in relief. The hard-throwing Graterol has been projected as a top-of-the-rotation starter, but the Twins viewed him as a reliever. According to The Athletic\u2019s report, the Red Sox \u201cevidently agree that he is not suited for a 150- to 170-inning workload, at least not right away.\u201d\n\nThe review of medical records is commonly one of the final steps before a trade is made official. The Athletic\u2019s report said the teams involved in this trade remain confident it will be completed.\n\nAlex Verdugo, the Dodgers outfielder who is the other player being dealt to the Red Sox, has been medically cleared, according to The Athletic. Verdugo missed the final two months of last season due to injuries sustained in his back and oblique.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Mookie Betts", "Red Sox", "Brusdar Graterol"], "authors": ["Steve Hewitt"], "publish_date": "Thu Feb  6 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "More than a day after it was reportedly agreed upon, the blockbuster three-team trade between the Red Sox, Dodgers and Twins still hasn\u2019t been finalized.
