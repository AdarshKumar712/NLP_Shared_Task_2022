Try refreshing your browser, or 'Doomsday' scenario of mass layoffs due to AI unlikely, federal documents say Back to video But officials warned there were early indications of challenges in parts of the economy that the government should do something about, such as the way online streaming services are reshaping music, television and movie production. In a separate briefing, officials were told ahead of summer that 11 per cent of jobs in Canada could be automated over the next 15 to 20 years, and a further 29 per cent are \u201clikely to change significantly.\u201d The Canadian Press obtained a copy of the briefing summary, as well as May and June drafts of the report, through the Access to Information Act.\n\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The report was to be used as the foundation for advice to the victor of the fall federal election on how to help workers at the dawn of a new decade. The work was part of a series of exercises officials have run to see how well \u201csocial safety net\u201d programs respond to the most dire of potential outcomes caused by technological shifts in the workforce. It\u2019s unclear how well federal programs fared. Those details, like many others in the documents, have been blacked out or not released because they are considered advice for government. Federal officials have forecast where the impacts of automation are likely to be felt most, such as rural towns reliant on manufacturing, according to documents previously obtained by The Canadian Press in March. Those documents, alluded to in the June report, also listed the towns most and least likely to feel the impacts in each province.\n\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content But exactly where effects are felt and how fast they arrive remains a guessing game. For instance, the federal documents say some tasks, such as copy editing and data entry, could be outsourced overseas to low-cost workers through online platforms. Three-dimensional printing, on the other hand, could bring back manufacturing jobs. Officials also wrote that other trends not measured in the report will shape the future of work, such as the transition to a low-carbon economy and increasing numbers of LGBTQ2 workers. Some policy responses will come into effect with the turn of the calendar to 2020, including the launch of a $250-a-year benefit for workers to be put towards training, and a matching leave underwritten by employment insurance. That work will be overseen by Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough, who has been given responsibility for skills training and the EI system.\n\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Officials advising Qualtrough have heard that many adults lack \u201csoft skills and basic digital skills\u201d needed for success in the future, according to a summary of a May presentation to deputy ministers \u2014 the top federal bureaucrats \u2014 by an official from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. A recent report by the Brookfield Institute came to a similar conclusion, and recommended governments create \u201ca wide variety of accessible programming designed to teach Canadians general workforce digital skills \u2026 along with general soft skills.\u201d Meanwhile, Labour Minister Filomena Tassi is tasked with updating the federal labour code, including increasing the federal minimum wage to at least $15 an hour, and additional protections for \u201cplatform workers,\u201d such as Uber drivers.\n\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Several of the details in Tassi\u2019s mandate letter reflect recommendations of a blue-ribbon panel of experts. The panel also recommended the government look at models of collective representation for non-unionized workers, and rules to compensate workers who stay connected by email to the office after work hours. Sunil Johal, chair of the panel, said a key message from the report is that labour rules and regulations need to be frequently reviewed as more shifts are felt in the workforce. He said there is also a need to make regulations more nimble. That might mean creating what Johal described as \u201coutcomes-based regulations\u201d to address shifts in the labour market to spell out what the government expects but allow businesses to determine the means to that end.\n\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cIf we take as a given that the world of work and the labour market is going to be shifting and adapting more quickly than ever as we move forward, then we absolutely need to move to regulatory legislative approaches that move just as quickly,\u201d Johal said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a decades-long lag, that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to have huge issues that \u2026 put labour standards at risk of falling just so far out of step that it\u2019s completely unacceptable.\u201d In a statement accompanying the release of the panel\u2019s report in December, Tassi said the government would \u201cconsider the excellent work done by the panel\u201d in making changes to federal labour rules. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nNP Posted Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.
