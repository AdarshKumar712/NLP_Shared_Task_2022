Which seems odd, considering where he calls home. At this point, dad probably wishes he\u2019d had the good sense to \u2018pull some strings\u2019 and get the baby-momma looked after some other way. Because now Hunter\u2019s drama is bleeding into dad\u2019s presidential hopes.\n\n(Again)\n\nTrending: Victims No More: These Orthodox Jews In NY Are Locked And Loaded The son of former Vice President Joe Biden shares a ZIP code in the Hollywood Hills with celebrities such as Ben Affleck, Christina Aguilera and Halle Berry, according to documents filed in Hunter\u2019s Arkansas paternity case. The three-bedroom, three-bathroom mid-century home is valued at $2.5 million. It sits at the end of a private gated drive and includes a pool.\n\nSource: NYPost\n\nThere has been a new development in attempts to access Hunter Biden\u2019s financial history for this case.\n\nAs of 10:20 on the last day of the decade, the presiding judge pulled the plug on his involvement with the case. He didn\u2019t give any specific explanation for why.\n\nThe judge in Hunter Biden\u2019s Arkansas paternity case has recused. Independence County Circuit Judge Don McSpadden filed an order at 10:20 a.m. Tuesday saying he was recusing \u201cpursuant to the Administrative Plan of the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit.\u201d A hearing in the case was scheduled for Tuesday. Attorneys for Lunden Alexis Roberts had urged the judge to find Biden in contempt of court at that hearing for not providing financial information for the past five years. \u201cOne of the clearest indicators of a judge\u2019s integrity is when he or she recuses from a case,\u201d said Clinton Lancaster, one of Roberts\u2019 attorneys. \u201cIt highlights the ethos and values that make the judiciary such a powerful, separate branch of government. Our client sincerely thanks Judge McSpadden for his time and attention to what has become a difficult and convoluted child support matter.\u201d\n\nSource: ArkansasOnline\n\nWhat was the plot twist?\n\nThe plot twist was a corroborating witness claiming Biden had helped con him out of a fortune, in a scheme involving Chinese nationals.\n\nShokin\u2019s witness statement was submitted to the court as part of Joel Caplan\u2019s motion this week to try and become a party in Roberts\u2019 paternity case with Biden. He claimed in Monday\u2019s filing that he wanted in on the case so he could get his hands on Biden\u2019s bank account records in order to prove he allegedly received $1.5 billion from Chinese companies that \u2018hustled Americans out of their life savings\u2019. Caplan told Judge Don McSpadden to \u2018follow the money\u2019 and in a 30-page filing, lays out how he was allegedly swindled out of 10 years of his life savings in a \u2018multi-billion dollar stock scheme known as the China Hustle.\u2019 Caplan, who filed papers from Jerusalem, Israel, claims many Chinese nationals made fortunes from the ploy, which involved presenting fake company documents and claiming they were genuine investments when they were actual frauds.\n\nSource: DailyMail\n\nRemember how Hunter was supposedly using his wealth to be the \u2018provider\u2019 for the Biden clan, including Joe?\n\nSuddenly it really DOES matter where all that money was coming from\u2026 and whether of it can be traced back to the US taxpayer.\n\nWill Biden come to regret all those taunts for Trump to \u2018come clean\u2019 with his financial dealings?\n\nDoes Sleepy Joe have a few financial skeletons in the closet he\u2019d rather we didn\u2019t look too closely at?\n\nNo WONDER his first instinct was his flat out refusal of the right of Senate to subpoena Joe or Hunter concerning their role in Ukraine.\n\nThe plot thickens.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Wes Walker Is The Author Of", "Doug Giles"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 09:00:39 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://clashdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cropped-clashdaily-logocolor-512-240x130.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://clashdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-01-at-3.53.50-AM.jpg", "secure_url": "https://clashdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-01-at-3.53.50-AM.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Plot Twist: Judge Recuses Himself In Midst Of Hunter Biden Paternity Case -- And A New Accuser Emerges", "description": "Much to his father's dismay, Hunter Biden just can't stay out of the news.", "url": "https://clashdaily.com/2020/01/plot-twist-judge-recuses-himself-in-midst-of-hunter-biden-paternity-case-and-a-new-accuser-emerges/", "site_name": "Clash Daily"}, "robots": "noimageindex", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Clash-Briefing-2322453058016956/", "section": "News Clash", "published_time": "2020-01-01T09:00:39+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 949850308377935, "pages": 1695781643993556}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Much to his father's dismay, Hunter Biden just can't stay out of the news.", "title": "Plot Twist: Judge Recuses Himself In Midst Of Hunter Biden Paternity Case -- And A New Accuser Emerges", "site": "@Doug_Giles", "image": "https://clashdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-01-at-3.53.50-AM.jpg", "creator": "@Doug_Giles"}, "gestures-prev": "https://clashdaily.com/2020/01/cancel-the-apocalypse-party-this-was-the-best-decade-in-human-history-heres-why/", "gestures-prev-cnt": 2, "gestures-next": "https://clashdaily.com/2020/01/watch-rudy-g-ringing-in-new-year-was-asked-about-ukraine-his-answer-was-maga-gold/", "gestures-next-cnt": 12, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.5", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://clashdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cropped-clashdaily-logocolor-512.png", "googlebot": "noimageindex"}, "canonical_link": "https://clashdaily.com/2020/01/plot-twist-judge-recuses-himself-in-midst-of-hunter-biden-paternity-case-and-a-new-accuser-emerges/"}
