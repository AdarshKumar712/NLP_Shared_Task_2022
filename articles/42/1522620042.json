ready to re-launch their annual awards tonight at GEMS Cambridge International School \u2013 Butabiika.\n\nThe awards were first organized in 2016 to reward the top achievers of 2015 but USF struggled to sustain that momentum after Arnold Kisulo and Jamila Lunkuse were awarded as the top swimmers then.\n\nThe two retired almost immediately after that recognition \u2013 as they got to the peak of their powers \u2013 but their legacy is intact.\n\nIn fact among the winners from 2016, Greenhill Academy still ranks among the best primary and secondary schools while among individuals, only Muzafaru Muwanguzi is still around to defend his title as best coach.\n\nHe goes up against Erick Kisero and Joseph Kabogoza, who was head coach as Uganda\u2019s Kirabo Namutebi won the country\u2019s first ever continental gold at the Africa Junior Championships in September.\n\nMuwanguzi, however, deserves even more credit for raising Namutebi \u2013 who holds the national record (26.98) in the girls\u2019 50m freestyle made at the World Junior Championships in Budapest, Hungary in August 2019. His club Dolphins also ranked number one at the USF National Championships in June last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKisero, who was Muwanguzi\u2019s assistant at the Cana Zone III Championships where Uganda finished second out of nine countries, also had his relatively smaller Altona Swim Club rank fourth at the nationals and top in water polo.\n\nTheir counterparts Cari Karugireyo (Silverfin), Zamzam Khalil (Aga Khan and Dolphins) and Tabithah Nakasinde (Malta) are in running for the best female coach award.\n\nMeanwhile, Namutebi, who bagged gold in the 50m breaststroke (35.13) and 50m freestyle (27.33) at the Africa Juniors will likely be crowned best female swimmer ahead of her senior counterparts Avice Meya and Selina Katumba.\n\nHer only competition tonight could be Dolphins teammate and para-swimmer Husnah Kukundakwe, who at 12 years represented Uganda at three international para meets and Paulsen Settumba, who made the most age group records. The trio battle for the most inspirational swimmer award.\n\nThe real clash of the titans is for best male swimmer award; Atuhaire Ambala broke national records for fun last year but Tendo Mukalazi edged him as best swimmer at the nationals last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Adnan Kabuye did not only break records like the two front-runners but was easily Uganda\u2019s best male performer at the Cana Zone III Championships in Nairobi last December.\n\nKabuye\u2019s influence transcended the pool and featured for the national team in open water too in Nairobi. And his consolation could be an open water award at the expense of his younger teammates Mikkah Kigundu and Hayyan Kisitu.\n\nFor USF and sponsors DStv, the challenge will be to make the awards night an annual fixture on their calendar.\n\n2019 Nominations\n\nBest Female Swimmer: Avice Meya, Kirabo Namutebi, Selina Katumba\n\nBest Male Swimmer: Adnan Kabuye, Atuhaire Ambala, Tendo Mukalazi\n\nMost Inspiring Athlete: Husnah Kukundakwe, Kirabo Namutebi, Paulsen Settumba\n\nBest Female Coach: Cari Karugireyo, Tabithah Nakasinde, Zamzam Khalil\n\nBest Male Coach: Erick Kisero, Joseph Kabogoza, Muzafaru Muwanguzi\n\nBest Female Open water swimmer: Ahura Ambala, Mubiru Swagiah, Olivia Nalwadda\n\nBest Male Open water swimmer: Adnan Kabuye, Hayyan Kisitu, Mikka Kigundu\n\nBest Female Masters Swimmer: Aya Nakitanda, Grace Kigundu, Philippa Makobere\n\nBest Male Masters Swimmer: Gilbert Kaburu, Hassan Latif, Morris Yuda Ssekamatte\n\nBest Swim Club: Dolphins, Seals, Silverfin\n\nBest Waterpolo Team: Altona, King\u2019s College Budo, Seeta Green HS\n\nBest Primary School: Greenhill Academy, Kampala Junior Academy, Seeta Junior Academy\n\nBest Secondary School: Greenhill Academy, Seeta Green High School, Taiba Secondary School\n\n2015 USF Awards Winners\n\nBest Senior Male Swimmer: Arnold Kisulo\n\nBest Senior Female Swimmer: Jamila Lunkuse\n\nBest Junior Male Swimmer: Nabil Saleh\n\nBest Junior Female Swimmer: Rebecca Ssengonzi\n\nBest Masters Female Swimmer: Kate Kizza\n\nBest Masters Male Swimmer: Latif Kajumbi\n\nBest Coach: Muzafaru Muwanguzi\n\nBest National Primary School: Greenhill Academy\n\nBest National Secondary School: Greenhill Academy", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["top swimmers", "Uganda", "Uganda Swimming Federation"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Makhtum Muziransa"], "publish_date": "Sat Feb 15 07:31:49 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The two retired almost immediately after that recognition \u2013 as they got to the peak of their powers \u2013 but their legacy is intact", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.monitor.co.ug/nationmedia/css/icons/dnmobile/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "eqqN6YcEBEKEAxJN1NQSt0AvrNPPvljIYMLVEGEjLgI", "msvalidate.01": "EAEA2E15D93BC2979D58720786AF2DDB", "alexaVerifyID": "e8s521zf2lW3kSQNwGY2XMME5No", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "The two retired almost immediately after that recognition \u2013 as they got to the peak of their powers \u2013 but their legacy is intact", "keywords": "top swimmers, Uganda, Uganda Swimming Federation", "fb": {"app_id": "???site.social.fb_app_id???", "pages": "???site.social.fbappadmin???"}, "og": {"site_name": "Daily Monitor", "type": "article", "title": "Crowning night for Uganda\u2019s top swimmers", "url": "https://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/Score/Crowning-night-for-Uganda-s-top-swimmers/689854-5456466-9iygl6z/index.html", "description": "The two retired almost immediately after that recognition \u2013 as they got to the peak of their powers \u2013 but their legacy is intact", "locale": {"identifier": "en_UK", "alternate": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-15 07:31:49", "modified_time": "2020-02-15 07:38:11"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://www.monitor.co.ug/image/view/-/5456480/medRes/2558930/-/2lssjc/-/score03pix.jpg", "width": 425, "height": 262}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@dailymonitor", "title": "Crowning night for Uganda\u2019s top swimmers", "description": "The two retired almost immediately after that recognition \u2013 as they got to the peak of their powers \u2013 but their legacy is intact", "image": "https://www.monitor.co.ug/image/view/-/5456480/medRes/2558930/-/2lssjc/-/score03pix.jpg", "url": "https://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/Score/Crowning-night-for-Uganda-s-top-swimmers/689854-5456466-9iygl6z/index.html"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/Score/Crowning-night-for-Uganda-s-top-swimmers/689854-5456466-9iygl6z/index.html"}
