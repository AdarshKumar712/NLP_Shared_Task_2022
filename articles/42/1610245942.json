I haven\u2019t at all. What are you saying?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Mr Trump told Mr Rucker, \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of very good results, and we had some results that perhaps aren\u2019t so good, I don\u2019t know, I just read about one, but I also read many times good.\n\n\u201cSo I haven\u2019t at all. And it\u2019s a great (sic) - for malaria, for lupus, for other things, and we\u2019ll see what it is.\u201d\n\nIn early April, Forbes reported that President Trump had a \u201csmall personal financial interest\u201d in Sanofi, a French drugmaker that produces hydroxychloroquine.\n\nA message from the Editor\n\nThank you for reading this story on our website.
