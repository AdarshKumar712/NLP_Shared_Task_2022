The Vermont senator posted a clip of Rogan from one of his recent podcasts with New York Times op-ed columnist Bari Weiss, where the comedian stated he would probably support Sanders in the upcoming election.\n\n\u201dI think I\u2019ll probably vote for Bernie. Him as a human being when I was hanging out with him, I believe in him. I like him, I like him a lot,\u201d, Rogan said before dismissing the recent controversy between Sanders and fellow candidate Elizabeth Warren. \u201cLook, you could dig up dirt on every single human being that\u2019s ever existed if you catch them in their worst moment. That said, you can\u2019t find very many with Bernie. He\u2019s been insanely consistent his entire life. He\u2019s basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing his whole life. And that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from.\u201d\n\nThe endorsement, followed by Sander\u2019s amplification of Rogan\u2019s support, has sparked newfound controversy and debate surrounding the campaign and has divided the senator\u2019s supporters on social media.\n\nRogan is a well known comedian, former Fear Factor host and beloved UFC commentator with an exceptionally successful podcast called The Joe Rogan Experience, which has over seven million YouTube subscribers and is downloaded tens of millions of times each month. However, Rogan is almost as controversial as he is popular due to the selection of questionable guests he has hosted on his show over the past few years, including far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes, disgraced far-right political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos, and conservative commentator (and homophobe) Steven Crowder.\n\nWhile there is much for the Sanders campaign to gain from Rogan\u2019s endorsement, it has also created a schism between the senator\u2019s supporters, especially among those who do not approve of Rogan\u2019s world view or approach to his podcast. This article will attempt to lay out the various pros and cons from Rogan\u2019s endorsement while determining its significance on the upcoming election.\n\nThe Good\n\nOver the past decade, Joe Rogan has managed to build a podcasting empire. His show, The Joe Rogan Experience, is one of the most popular podcasts available on the internet, and was the second most downloaded podcast on Apple\u2019s network in 2017 and 2018. The podcast also receives tens of millions of views on YouTube each month, mainly from the highly coveted young male demographic who are drawn to the relatable, laid back nature of the podcast.\n\nOver the last couple of years, Rogan\u2019s podcast has also become politically significant. In 2019, the comedian hosted three 2020 Democratic presidential candidates: Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, and Bernie Sanders. Rogan later claimed that other Democratic candidates like Joe Biden, and Elizabeth Warren requested to appear on the show but were not accepted as guests.\n\nYang was the first 2020 presidential candidate to appear on the show. A fringe candidate with a loyal base of young supporters, Yang\u2019s campaign later reported a significant spike in campaign donations stemming from his appearance on the show. \u201cEverything is up and to the right since the Joe Rogan podcast,\u201d Yang\u2019s campaign manager told the Daily Beast. \u201cThat was the key. That was the moment.\u201d\n\nThen in August 2019, Rogan hosted Sanders on his podcast, where the two discussed health care, gun laws, and \u2014 naturally \u2014 aliens. The hour-long appearance was important for several reasons. Firstly, it showed that Sanders was communicating left-wing values on platforms that did not represent his ideological stance. By appearing on the show, Sanders not only promoted his own policies, but successfully exposed Rogan\u2019s audience to left-wing ideas in a favourable and persuasive manner.\n\nSecondly, it was arguably a better platform for Sanders to deliver his policies than mainstream media has proven to be since the Democratic primaries began. While Sanders has not gotten a fair shake from outlets such as MSNBC, CNN, and the New York Times, he was allowed the time to reach non-traditional constituencies while on Rogan\u2019s podcast without being interrupted or written off. He managed to persuade a portion of Rogan\u2019s audience while still delivering his pro-working class message.\n\nSander\u2019s appearance on Rogan\u2019s show clearly left a positive mark on the host, as Rogan has since admitted that he would \u201cprobably\u201d vote for the Vermont senator, even going so far as to say that \u201cwhen I was hanging out with him, I believe in him.\u201d If that is how Sander\u2019s impacted Rogan after a single podcast appearance, imagine the effect it had on the millions of impressionable young minds that listen to Rogan\u2019s show. The opportunity to win back some of the voters that mainstream Democrats have alienated is something that Sanders should continue to do and proves that he would be a formidable challenger for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Bad\n\nWhile Joe Rogan is an exceptionally popular podcast host with a cult-like following, he has also proven to be a controversial figure with a willingness to push the boundaries when it comes to acceptable guests on his shows.\n\nOver the past decade, Rogan has hosted a wide range of characters that fall across the entire political spectrum, including liberals, conservatives, reactionaries, innocuous weirdos, conspiracy theorists, and snake oil salesmen. His list of guests include the likes of Edward Snowden, Richard Dawkins, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Jesse Ventura, Mel Gibson, Robert Downey Jr., Elon Musk, Bob Lazar, Roseanne Barr, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, and Mike Tyson. There is no common denominator between the aforementioned guests except for their status as well-known figures.\n\nHowever, Rogan has hosted several figures who should not have been offered such expansive platforms. These include Alex Jones, who promotes conspiracy theories on his InfoWars network such as white genocide, vaccines, and climate change denial. Some of his most despicable actions include claiming that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 and the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018 were false flag operations, which led to parents of victims and survivors being harassed and threatened.\n\nDespite Jones\u2019 reputation, Rogan still referred to him as the \u201cmost misunderstood guy on the planet\u201d in 2019. By normalizing people like Jones as a loveable lunatic and harmless weirdo, Rogan is inadvertently exposing his audience to hateful and xenophobic rhetoric and contributing to their potential radicalization.\n\nRogan has also been guilty of transphobic comments over the past few years, most notably when discussing trans MMA fighter Fallon Fox in 2013, whom he referred to as a \u201cf***ing man.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe calls herself a woman but... I tend to disagree,\u201d Rogan said on his podcast in 2013 (h/t Bleacher Report). \u201cAnd, uh, she, um... she used to be a man but now she has had, she\u2019s a transgender which is (the) official term that means you\u2019ve gone through it, right? And she wants to be able to fight women in MMA. I say no f***ing way. I say if you had a dick at one point in time, you also have all the bone structure that comes with having a dick. You have bigger hands, you have bigger shoulder joints. You\u2019re a f***ing man. That\u2019s a man, OK? You can\u2019t have... that\u2019s... I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t have a dick any more\u2026\u201d\n\nFox, a natal male who transitioned in 2006, had served in the Navy as a operations specialist 2nd class for the U.S.S. Enterprise to support her daughter. She was also forced to quit college and to work as a trucker in order to save money for gender reassignment surgery. Yet despite the fact that she had transitioned seven years earlier, she was still made the target of Rogan\u2019s bullying campaign.\n\n\u201cLook, [Fox is] huge! She\u2019s not just huge, she\u2019s got a f***ing man\u2019s face,\u201dRogan continued. \u201cI mean, you can wear all the lipstick you want. You want to be a woman and you want to take female hormones, you want to get a boob job, that\u2019s all fine. I support your life to live, your right to live as a woman. Fight guys, yes. She has to fight guys. First of all, she\u2019s not really a she. She\u2019s a transgender, post-op person. The operation doesn\u2019t shave down your bone density. It doesn\u2019t change. You look at a man\u2019s hands and you look at a women\u2019s hands and they\u2019re built different. They\u2019re just thicker, they\u2019re stronger, your wrists are thicker, your elbows are thicker, your joints are thicker. Just the mechanical function of punching, a man can do it much harder than a woman can, period.\u201d\n\nWhile Rogan promotes himself as a free thinker who is happy to discuss topics with both sides of the political spectrum, he has also allowed his podcast \u2014 and its substantial audience \u2014 to be hijacked by charlatans, conspiracy theorists, and bad faith actors who end up influencing his impressionable audience. However, while Rogan\u2019s support for Sanders is controversial given Rogan\u2019s past mistakes, it should be placed in relative contrast with the countless controversial characters who have previously endorsed Democratic candidates and were not met with the same level of scrutiny.\n\nThe Political\n\nWhile Sanders\u2019s willingness to amplify Rogan\u2019s endorsement is problematic given Rogan\u2019s questionable perspective on several topics, it is hardly the most controversial endorsement that a Democratic candidate has received.\n\nIn 2016, Bernie Sanders criticized Hillary Clinton\u2019s ties to Henry Kissinger during one of the Democratic debates, admitting he found it \u201crather amazing\u201d that she was proud of her relationship with Kissinger. He added that Kissinger \u2014 whose legacy includes much of the Vietnam War and the genocidal bombing of Cambodia \u2014 was \u201cone of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.\u201d\n\n\u201dI\u2019m proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend,\u201d Sanders added during the debate. \u201cI will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.\u201d\n\nInstead of referring to Kissinger as the war criminal he is for helping orchestrate the carpet-bombing of Cambodia which killed between 150,000 to 500,000 citizens among other crimes, Clinton referred to him as a \u201cfriend.\u201d And while her comments were criticized by the media, it highlighted the hypocrisy of establishment democrats and their willingness to put aside controversial differences in the pursuit of self-interest. In the end, Clinton\u2019s comments about Kissinger had little effect on her winning the Democratic nomination. She continued to rack up endorsements, this time from celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z, Lena Dunham, Bruce Springsteen and Kate Perry. The Kissinger comments became a thing of the past.\n\nSanders has proven that he can communicate through American pop culture after endorsements from Jack White, rapper T.I, Norah Jones and Brandi Carlile, as well as interviews with the likes of Cardi B and Killer Mike. And while Sanders did not need to amplify Rogan\u2019s endorsement to reap its benefits, it highlights his willingness to take advantage of opportunities to capture a voter base that is generally skeptical of Democrats and their policies.\n\nRogan\u2019s fan base does not have a primary political allegiance \u2014 their allegiance is to Rogan, who has taught them to question everything. Winning them over is a coup because many are potentially undecided voters. It could also open the door for other progressive voices to be featured on Rogan\u2019s show, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib among others.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Sanders spokeswoman Briahna Joy Gray released a statement saying that \u201cthe goal of our campaign is to build a multi-racial, multi-generational movement that is large enough to defeat Donald Trump and the powerful special interests whose greed and corruption is the root cause of the outrageous inequality in America. Sharing a big tent requires including those who do not share every one of our beliefs, while always making clear that we will never compromise our values.\u201d\n\nWhile Rogan\u2019s transphobia and questionable guests should be criticized, it is understandable why Sanders would use Rogan\u2019s platform and support at such a crucial stage of the presidential campaign.\n\nIt is strictly political.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Karim Zidan", "Jan"], "publish_date": "Fri Jan 24 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "On Thursday morning, Bernie Sanders took to twitter to share a clip of Joe Rogan seemingly endorsing him in the Democratic primary.
