disturbances in NSW prisons\n\nPosted\n\nTensions remain high in New South Wales jails as authorities work to prevent coronavirus spreading through the prison system.\n\nKey points: The prison officers' union says it is a \"significant achievement\" that no cases of coronavirus have been recorded in NSW jails\n\nTension has been high, however, since COVID-19 restrictions saw the end of contact visits and a reduction in the availability of contraband\n\nCorrective Services is allowing inmates virtual visits in a bid to try and ease their frustration\n\nThere have been several disturbances in recent weeks, including riots at Wellington and Goulburn during the Easter break.\n\nGas was used by prison guards to subdue the prisoners at Wellington Correctional Centre, in the state's central west, after inmates started a fire and destroyed equipment.\n\n\"It is fairly tense within the prison system,\" Public Service Association (PSA) general secretary Stewart Little said.\n\n\"You've had around a month now where there's been no access visits with family members \u2014 it's really only essential visits.\"\n\n'Heightened emotions'\n\nAll visits have been cancelled to stop a COVID-19 outbreak in the state's prison system.\n\n\"It comes with consequences,\" Mr Little said.\n\n\"Of course many, many inmates are very agitated, very tense, given that the fact that it's now been over a month since there's been contact visits.\"\n\nThe PSA said authorities were working hard to avoid coronavirus outbreaks like those that had occurred in prisons in New York and the United Kingdom.\n\nCorrective Services NSW said inmates were feeling \"frustrated\" and were \"experiencing heightened emotions\" because their routines had been disrupted.\n\nThere are about 14,000 inmates in prisons across the state.\n\nSome 1,200 virtual visits have been conducted so far.\n\nA spokeswoman for Corrective Services said that practice would continue.\n\nContraband shortage\n\nThe restrictions also mean that illicit goods like tobacco and illegal drugs are not making it into prisons.\n\n\"You have inmates that are extremely dangerous, violent inmates, many with sentences that are going to see many of them never get out,\" Mr Little said.\n\n\"They are very, very difficult to manage at the best of times, but when you then further restrict them obviously that becomes even more difficult.\"\n\nMr Little said it was a significant achievement that there had been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in NSW prisons.\n\n\"It shows the dedication and professionalism of all of the Corrective Services staff,\" he said.\n\nThe PSA says planning is underway for worst-case scenarios, including the use of isolation hubs and field hospitals to group prisoners diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nTopics: prisons-and-punishment, covid-19, law-crime-and-justice, wellington-2820, goulburn-2580, nsw, act", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["prison riots", "prisons", "crowding", "nsw
