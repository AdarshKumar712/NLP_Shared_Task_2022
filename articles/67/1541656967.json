Early Tuesday morning, voters from California to Maine hurried to the voting polls as 14 states are all voting on the same day.\n\n\u201cOn March 3, 14 states and one territory from across the country have primary elections: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and American Samoa. Voters in all Super Tuesday states will participate in a primary, while Democrats in American Samoa will caucus,\u201d USA Today reports.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders, billionaire Michael Bloomberg, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard are all still in contention for the nomination. So who will end up on top?\n\nThe Associated Press reports:\n\nMillions of voters from Maine to California headed to the polls on Super Tuesday, the delegate-rich prize in the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination that\u2019s shaping up as a contest between two starkly different visions for the party\u2019s future as it hurtles toward a November rematch with President Donald Trump. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has energized liberals and young voters, sought to pull away from the rest of the field, while former vice president Joe Biden hoped to ride a wave of momentum and endorsements to cement himself as the standard-bearer for the party\u2019s moderate wing. The two men, riding atop a rapidly shrinking Democratic field, have assembled coalitions of disparate demographics and political beliefs, and the day could help shape whether the nomination fight will stretch until the party\u2019s convention this summer in Milwaukee.\n\nThe elections will likely favor Biden or Sanders as hundreds of delegates are up for grabs.\n\nBiden is expected to do well on Super Tuesday and polling site FiveThirtyEight has him recapturing his lead over Sanders.\n\nThe former vice president got second place in Nevada and won South Carolina. He also recently scored key endorsements from former candidates Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nSanders is looking to win back some of the early lead he captured with a second-place finish in Iowa and after having won New Hampshire and Nevada.\n\nBloomberg, who was not on the ballot for any of the first four primary states, has spent over $400 million advertising in Super Tuesday states. He will look to score big and show he is a real contender in the race.\n\nShould Bloomberg score 15 percent, the minimum to earn delegates in the individual contests, he could also score a sizable amount of delegates.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Mar  3 17:55:11 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://analyzingmeric.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-02-26-at-12.32.28-PM-1.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Several States Are Participating In Super Tuesday Today, Here's What It Means For The Candidates", "description": "Super Tuesday is here and it is expected to offer up a clear leader in the Democratic presidential primary.
