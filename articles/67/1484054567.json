People\u2019s names are in the headlines of articles, and the rise of the \"famous entrepreneur\" has begun. Personal branding is in, and it\u2019s a secret weapon. It\u2019s how people know who you are.\n\nRelated: 3 Tips for Personal Branding on Social Media\n\nTo understand personal branding, you must understand business branding. Effective business branding is why we don\u2019t hesitate to purchase a new facial cleanser from our favorite skincare brand, whereas we hesitate to try a facial cleanser from a brand we\u2019ve never heard of. We become defensive of brands. We\u2019re either die-hard Apple or PC supporters or Coke or Pepsi drinkers. Personal brands connote the same type of loyalty.\n\nHere are a few reasons why personal branding is a secret weapon in your career.\n\n1. Personal branding builds trust with your customers.\n\nThink about it. If a stranger approached you on the street and tried to sell you an ecommerce consulting package, you wouldn\u2019t be interested unless they had some serious facts about how their package could help you. But, if someone you knew for their expertise in scaling ecommerce businesses approached you, you\u2019d be more likely to buy from them. You\u2019d feel connected to them.\n\nIf you can create this same sense of trust with your target customers through what you share on social media and how you interact in person, you\u2019ll have that secret weapon when it\u2019s time to sell.\n\nRelated: Why Personal Branding Must Be Your First Focus\n\n2. Personal branding helps your employees get behind your cause.\n\nA personal brand doesn\u2019t just help to get customers invested in your cause -- it also helps get your employees invested. Altimeter shared research that proves when a company invested in personal branding initiatives, \u201cemployees were 27 percent more hopeful about their company, 20 percent more likely to stay, and 40 percent more likely to believe in the competitiveness of their employer.\u201d These personal branding initiatives could include a \u201cmeet the team\u201d campaign on social media, a monthly letter from the CEO with accessible and friendly language, or starting a YouTube channel featuring interviews with key team members.\n\nIn addition to helping current employees get behind your cause, it could also help with recruiting, too. If you\u2019re looking to expand your company\u2019s team, high-quality employees may be more likely to interview with you and accept a position if they\u2019ve heard about you in your industry, or feel like they know you beyond your initial emails because of the content you have available.\n\n3. Personal branding helps social media work for you.\n\nFinally, personal branding is at its height when it\u2019s working for you on social media. A recent research index from Sprout Social found that customers are 77 percent more likely to buy from a brand if they follow them on social media. And, customers will only follow a brand on social media if they have content that\u2019s interesting, useful, or funny to them.\n\nEngage your personal brand on your company's social media -- and your personal page -- by sharing stories from your life, inspirational quotes that have been helpful to you, and funny videos. All of this content compounded will help \"strangers\" feel as if they know you, bolstering your personal brand and leading to customers.\n\nRelated: Personal Branding Is Just as Important as Business Branding\n\nAs far as how to get in touch with your personal brand, remember there\u2019s no one you have to be but yourself. It sounds cheesy, but people can tell if you\u2019re being authentic or trying to convey something you\u2019re not.\n\nStand in your personal brand\u2019s truth and share it loud and proud as your secret weapon.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Social Media", "Marketing", "Personal Branding", "Entrepreneurs", "Branding"], "tags": ["Finance", "Growth Strategies", "Personal Branding", "Starting a Business", "Marketing", "Social Media", "Leadership", "Entrepreneurs", "Inspiration", "Technology", "ecommerce"], "authors": ["Imran Tariq"], "publish_date": "Mon Dec 30 14:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Personal branding builds trust with customers and employees.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.entrepreneur.com/ent-apple-touch-icon.jpg", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2019 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.
