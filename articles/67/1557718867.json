Black rhinos are still in grave danger but the small increase \u2013 an annual rate of 2.5% over six years, has swollen the population from 4,845 in 2012 to an estimated 5,630 in 2018, giving hope that efforts put into saving the species are paying off. The painstaking attempts to save the black rhino have included moving some individuals from established groups to new locations, increasing the species\u2019 range and ensuring viable breeding populations, as well as protecting them through stronger law enforcement efforts. Numbers of all of the three subspecies of black rhino are now improving.\n\nSOURCE: THE GUARDIAN\n\nShare it!", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["afripedia 51", "Kenya 41", "Africa 190", "African countries 98", "Africa Top10 News 75", "South Africa 52", "travel guide 50"], "authors": ["Adc Editor", ".Molongui-Author-Box .Molongui-Author-Box-Tabs Nav.Molongui-Author-Box-Tabs-Full", "Background-Color", ".Molongui-Author-Box .Molongui-Author-Box-Tabs Nav Label", ".Molongui-Author-Box .Molongui-Author-Box-Tabs Input Id", "'Mab-Tab-Profile-'", "Checked", "Nav Label For", "'Mab-Tab-Related-'", "'Mab-Tab-Contact-'"], "publish_date": "Mon Mar 23 18:27:29 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.51/cxz.f6d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cropped-color_wt_transparant-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "An African Conservation Story Worth Celebrating - Africa.com", "description": "Numbers of African black rhinos in the wild have risen by several hundred, a rare...", "url": "https://africa.com/an-african-conservation-story-worth-celebrating/", "site_name": "Africa.com", "updated_time": "2020-03-23T18:27:31+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.51/cxz.f6d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/5-17.jpg?time=1585077057", "secure_url": "https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.51/cxz.f6d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/5-17.jpg?time=1585077057", "width": 800, "height": 480}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Africacom", "section": "Top 10 News", "published_time": "2020-03-23T18:27:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-23T18:27:31+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Numbers of African black rhinos in the wild have risen by several hundred, a rare...", "title": "An African Conservation Story Worth Celebrating - Africa.com", "site": "@africa_com", "image": "https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.51/cxz.f6d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/5-17.jpg?time=1585077057", "creator": "@africa_com"}, "author": "ADC Editor", "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "https://africa.com", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.51/cxz.f6d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cropped-color_wt_transparant-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://africa.com/an-african-conservation-story-worth-celebrating/"}
