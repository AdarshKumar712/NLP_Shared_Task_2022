The U.S. House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump Dec. 18 for abuse of power and obstruction.\n\nIjsselstein said he went online to find out if anyone was making an impeachment soap, and when he found people comparing the impeachment proceeding to a soap opera, he figured he was on to something.\n\n\"There is lots of references to soap so I thought it would be a neat idea to use that word soap and turn it into an impeachment soap,\" he said.\n\nPieter Ijsselstein has produced 600 bars of impeachment soap. (CBC)\n\nIjsselstein said the response to the new soap has been good, especially with people looking to buy gifts for relatives who are big Trump supporters.\n\n\"My son-in-law actually put a sample of it online and immediately got a sale,\" he said.\n\nIjsselstein said he isn't political and created the soap as a humorous word play.\n\nDemocratic soap?\n\nHe's now thinking about whether to create some sort of soap with Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, on the wrapper.\n\n\"I'll just see how the impeachment soap goes first,\" he said.\n\nIjsselstein said he has a feeling news about the soap could travel fast through social media, and he will be swamped with orders.\n\n\"It's amazing how many U.S. customers we have,\" he said.\n\n\"We get orders on a daily basis now. I think we get a fairly large number of tourists from the U.S. and I am pretty sure they are going to snap up this soap very quickly.\"\n\nMore P.E.I. news", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The owner of the Island Potato Soap Company has come up with a new soap he hopes will appeal to some customers south of the border.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/a/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=cbcnews, cbcnews://1.5411216", "og": {"site_name": "CBC", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-impeachment-soap-dec-2019-1.5411216", "title": "P.E.I. company launches impeachment soap for American market | CBC News", "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5411452.1577804334!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/impeachment-soap.jpg", "description": "The owner of the Island Potato Soap Company has come up with a new soap he hopes will appeal to some customers south of the border.", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 142551811174}, "vf": {"section": "2.658", "unique_id": "1.5411216"}, "google-site-verification": "pJy_QmRvDz2tr7X8eQ6Y1L3Se-8RWM_PpJX42Pr_fYo", "twitter": {"site": "@cbc", "player": {"width": 640, "height": 360}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The owner of the Island Potato Soap Company has come up with a new soap he hopes will appeal to some customers south of the border."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-impeachment-soap-dec-2019-1.5411216"}
