present the latest body of work in their ongoing project cabinland, including their latest diamond cabin. the project comprises a collection of moss-covered, off-grid cabin dwellings in the middle of the forest. the design/build team has so far demonstrated their knack for creating tiny, unique woodland homes with a wanderlust-arousing truck cabin and an octagonal, fairytale-like dwelling. before the construction of the main house, cabinland sees the completion of three new jewel-like structures including the diamond cabin, a hot-tub, and a video series which documents the team\u2019s entire design-build process.\n\n\n\ndiamond house\n\nas sara and jacob\u2019s cabinland continues to grow, now with three new tiny woodland structures, the team develops a documentary-like video series. during the upcoming construction of the main house, the team will live in the newly built \u2018diamond cabin,\u2019 a radially planned, two story dwelling \u2014 its second level accessible by ladder \u2014 finished in timber shingles and a thick layer of moss.\n\n\n\ndiamond cabin\n\nin the meantime, the team keeps their clothes and things stored away in the new wardrobe cabin \u2014 its asymmetrical and dramatically pitched roof clad in the same lush moss. the property\u2019s water filtration system is housed within a pump house, the third cabin designed in the same language and forested materials, expressing an inverted, steeply pitched roof. viewers can follow the continuing progress on the project through the video series \u2018cabinland.\u2019\n\nView this post on
