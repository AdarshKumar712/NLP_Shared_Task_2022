As with the other carmakers, this is an attempt to alleviate maintenance concerns during the nationwide shutdown that was instituted on March 25 and is slated to continue till at least May 3 in its current form.\n\nThe British automaker reports that service schedule intervals have been extended by two months/3,200km. The company says that retailers will honour warranty commitment for two additional months for vehicles where \u201ccustomer concern is reported and repairs could not be completed due to lockdown and the warranty would expire during this period\u201d. Due consideration has also been given to owners whose extended warranties are expiring between March 23 and the end of lockdown. These people are entitled to claim warranty on repairs up to 1,000km or 30 days after the lockdown is lifted.\n\nDespite the restrictions on movements, the company has ensured that roadside assistance teams are operative and JLR vehicle owners can summon their services in case of an emergency.\n\nLike every other automaker in the country, Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s dealerships remain shuttered for now. Once the lockdown lifts, the company will be looking forward to bring the new Defender SUV to its dealerships, prices for which have already been announced. Land Rover also launched the second-gen Evoque and the heavily facelifted Discovery Sport in our market this year, in the months preceding the lockdown.\n\nAlso see:\n\nNew car, bike warranty extensions due to COVID-19 - A complete list\n\n2020 Land Rover Defender review, test drive\n\nLand Rover Discovery Sport facelift BS6 review, test drive\n\n2020 Range Rover Evoque review, test drive", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Shirish Gandhi"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "oLSHknT7gXOYd0Nf4Uii5hR9bG2uzq5B9DQQFGSA_j0", "Description": "Owners are being provided extension of one-to-two months on service and warranty schemes to alleviate concerns during lockdown.
