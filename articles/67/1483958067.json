Many fruits and vegetables have compounds (such as flavones) that chemically react in the same ways as the HDAC- and DNMT-inhibiting drugs in this study.\n\nSome compounds in these foods, especially folic acid, have opposite effects.\n\nThis research suggests that exposure to a high fat diet or endocrine disrupting chemicals in the womb might be reversed by the consumption of foods high in DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, while those who have not had such exposures might also gain a cancer protective benefit from consuming foods high in folic acid.\n\nThe scientists noted, however, that their findings, particularly as they relate to diet, need to be studied in people.\n\n\"Our next step will be to try to identify biomarkers in humans that indicate an exposure in the womb to diets or endocrine disrupting chemicals that could increase breast cancer risk later in life,\" said Hilakivi-Clarke.\n\nbu/rt", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.sify.com/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "Description": "Washington, Jan 1 (IANS) Researchers have found that combining neurologic and blood pressure drugs may reduce breast tumour development.", "google_contents": "Neurologic, BP drugs may reduce breast tumour development", "og": {"description": "Washington, Jan 1 (IANS) Researchers have found that combining neurologic and blood pressure drugs may reduce breast tumour development.", "title": "Neurologic, BP drugs may reduce breast tumour development", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.sify.com/news/neurologic--bp-drugs-may-reduce-breast-tumour-development-news-international-ubbs4oebcihch.html", "site_name": "Sify"}, "fb": {"app_id": 189103277794050}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.sify.com/news/neurologic--bp-drugs-may-reduce-breast-tumour-development-news-international-ubbs4oebcihch.html"}
