(Photo credit: Anil Agarwal)\n\nAGRA: A 37-year-old bullion trader allegedly killed himself after shooting his wife and his minor daughter in his car near 105 milestones of Yamuna Expressway in Mathura on Wednesday.While the trader, Neeraj Agarwal, his wife, Neha ( 35) and his daughter, Dhanya (6), were found dead on the back seat of the car, his son, Shaurya (10), who was also shot at, is battling for his life in a hospital in Delhi.Police said that the incident took place after 12am on Wednesday. Police sources claimed that Neeraj was \u201cdepressed\u201d due to long ongoing Enforcement directorate inquiry against him. The inquiry had reportedly been initiated after demonetisation. Police officials said that this could have been a plausible reason behind the murders and suicide.According to SP (city) AK Meena, the family hails from Mathura but had been staying in Delhi\u2019s Mayur Vihar for the past few months. He said the injured boy was found breathing when the police broke the glass of the car and he was immediately rushed to Nayati hospital from where he was shifted to Apollo hospital, Delhi, as his condition was critical.Meena told TOI that small note was also found inside the car and the same has been sent for a forensic wing for checking its authenticity. He said, police found a pistol in Neeraj\u2019s right hand and he had apparently shot himself on his right temple. While Neeraj was sitting on the driver\u2019s seat, all the other three members of his family were on the back seat and car was locked. The SP said the bodies have been sent for post mortem.Talking to TOI, Neeraj\u2019s father Dinesh Chandra Agarwal, claimed that Neeraj could not have committed this crime and this was a murder, planned by the trader\u2019s enemies. He said some people had attacked and shot at Neeraj two years ago in Govardhan area and a police complaint was filed in this regard. Fortunately, he survived as the bullet nicked his car only.\u201cMy son and his family members were murdered,\u201d he said, adding that his son Neeraj had shifted to Delhi around 7 months back and used to come to Mathura frequently. He said that his wife also hailed from Mathura\u2019s Jaganathpuri area.He admitted that an ED inquiry was going on but Neeraj had filed an appeal in the case and this could not be the reason for his death.In Video: 37-year-old bullion trader, wife and daughter found dead in car near Yamuna Expressway", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Agra news", "Agra latest news", "Agra news live", "Agra news today", "Today news Agra", "Yamuna Expressway Accident", "trader and his wife and daughter found dead", "f Yamuna Expressway in Mathura", "3 found dead in car near Yamuna Expressway", "105 milestones of Yamuna Expressway in Mathura"], "tags": ["Mumbai Rains", "Chennai Rains", "Delhi Pollution", "Mumbai Floods", "Srinagar encounter", "Bangalore Rains", "105 milestones of Yamuna Expressway in Mathura", "Delhi Earthquake", "Madras High Court"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "While the trader, Neeraj Agarwal, his wife, Neha ( 35) and his daughter, Dhanya (6), were found dead on the back seat of the car, his son, Shaurya (10", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "While the trader, Neeraj Agarwal, his wife, Neha ( 35) and his daughter, Dhanya (6), were found dead on the back seat of the car, his son, Shaurya (10", "keywords": "Agra news, Agra latest news, Agra news live, Agra news today, Today news Agra,Yamuna Expressway Accident,trader and his wife and daughter found dead,f Yamuna Expressway in Mathura,3 found dead in car near Yamuna Expressway,105 milestones of Yamuna Expressway in Mathura", "og": {"title": "Bullion trader, his wife and daughter found dead in car near Yamuna Expressway | Agra News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/bullion-trader-his-wife-and-daughter-found-dead-in-car-near-yamuna-expressway/articleshow/73056473.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73056489,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-107674,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "While the trader, Neeraj Agarwal, his wife, Neha ( 35) and his daughter, Dhanya (6), were found dead on the back seat of the car, his son, Shaurya (10", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/bullion-trader-his-wife-and-daughter-found-dead-in-car-near-yamuna-expressway/articleshow/73056473.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73056489,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-107674,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "Bullion trader, his wife and daughter found dead in car near Yamuna Expressway | Agra News - Times of India", "description": "While the trader, Neeraj Agarwal, his wife, Neha ( 35) and his daughter, Dhanya (6), were found dead on the back seat of the car, his son, Shaurya (10", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/bullion-trader-his-wife-and-daughter-found-dead-in-car-near-yamuna-expressway/articleshow/73056473.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 26781952138, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0", "robots": "NOODP"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/bullion-trader-his-wife-and-daughter-found-dead-in-car-near-yamuna-expressway/articleshow/73056473.cms"}
