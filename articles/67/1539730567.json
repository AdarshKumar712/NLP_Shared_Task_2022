(Photo: Mickey Welsh/Advertoser)\n\nIf it wasn't clear beforehand, the members of a group formed by Gov. Kay Ivey to study gambling likely understand the thicket of legal and political questions ahead of them after a meeting on Thursday.\n\nThe Governor's Study Group on Gambling Policy assembled for its first gathering to sign ethics pledges and hear a lengthy presentation from the governor's office about current gambling law in the state.\n\nThe group is, in Ivey's words, charged with gathering the \"facts\" about gambling in Alabama \u2014 what's here; what's in other states, and the pluses and minuses of bringing what's there here.\n\n\"The question is, what revenues have these states seen?\" said Erica McKay, deputy general counsel for the governor's office. \"And what benefits and costs have these states seen?\"\n\nThe panel includes former U.S. Surgeon General Regina Benjamin and former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Jim Main. Former Montgomery Mayor Todd Strange, who is chairing the group, said he believed the groups purpose was to look beyond the current laws to assess the potential impact of expanded gambling.\n\n\"It\u2019s not so much worrying about what the law says today as what we think is the best benefit for the state of Alabama,\" he said.\n\nAlabama's constitution bans most forms of gambling in the absence of local amendments authorizing it, and the state is one of a handful that does not have a lottery. The Poarch Band of Creek Indians, a federally-recognized tribe operating under federal law, runs casinos in Atmore, Montgomery and Wetumpka that offer electronic bingo. Dog tracks such as VictoryLand in Macon County and GreeneTrack in Greene County also offer electronic bingo, though the Alabama Supreme Court has read the local amendments very narrowly and put their legal status in jeopardy.\n\nAttempts to establish a lottery and resolve the status of gambling at the dog tracks have into mutual antagonism between the Poarch Band and the dog tracks over the proper approaches. Legislators representing areas with dog tracks \u2014 often large employers in those communities \u2014 have conditioned their support for a lottery on settling the status of the dog tracks.\n\nBuy Photo Governor Kay Ivey delivers her State of the State Address in the old house chamber in the state capitol building in Montgomery, Ala., on Tuesday evening February 4, 2020. (Photo: Mickey Welsh / Advertiser)\n\nMost of the meeting was devoted to a presentation from Will Parker, general counsel for Gov. Ivey, outlining the laws on gambling in the state and existing gambling. Parker pointed to Section 65 of the 1901 Alabama Constitution, which bans lotteries and gift enterprises. Parker said \"lottery\" had a larger legal definition than the one we think of.\n\n\"When we use the word lottery colloquially, we think of a certain kind of game, going to a gas station in Georgia and buying a ticket ... that term is much broader,\" he said. \"It\u2019s been read as a very broad prohibition against gambling in our state.\"\n\nRepublican members of the House and Senate said prior to the session they wanted to tackle all aspects of gambling. House Ways and Means General Fund chair Steve Clouse, R-Ozark, says he plans to file a constitutional amendment that would authorize a state lottery, with money going to pre-kindergarten programs and financial aid for college.\n\nIn her first major break with the legislature since becoming governor, Ivey announced the formation of her gambling study group in February's State of the State address, saying she needed \"facts\" and a clear understanding of the status of gambling before moving forward. Legislative leaders have signaled they may move ahead with a lottery \u2014 the governor has no role in passage of a constitutional amendment \u2014 but negotiation of a gambling compact with the Poarch Band, a prerequisite to the the tribe offering slot machines and traditional table games, would be in Ivey's hands.\n\nMore: Gov. Kay Ivey: No tribal compact before she gets 'facts' on gambling\n\nIvey signaled last month she would not pursue a compact before the group's final report, expected before the end of the year.\n\nMembers of the committee signed ethics pledges saying they had no intent to profit from their service and knew of no conflicts of interest. The members of the group are not being compensated.\n\nContact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Brian Lyman at 334-240-0185 or blyman@gannett.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2020/03/05/gov-kay-iveys-gambling-study-group-assembles-1st-meeting/4962603002/", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Brian Lyman", "Published P.M.
