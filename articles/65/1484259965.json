Throughout last year alone, the president was at a golf club over at least 86 days.\n\nIn response, Klobuchar shared the article and said: \"For the record, I spent 0 days on the golf course in 2019.\"\n\nFor the record, I spent 0 days on the golf course in 2019.https://t.co/nMaa86AXwI \u2014 Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) January 1, 2020\n\nTrump is not the only U.S. president to have been repeatedly criticized over his golfing habits. Former President Barack Obama was also part of a long line of American leaders who have demonstrated a love for the sport. In 2016, Trump repeatedly criticized his predecessor for spending time on the golf course during his campaign trail.\n\n\"I mean he's played more golf than most people on the PGA Tour, this guy,\" the president said once said at a rally in New Hampshire. \"What is it, over 300 rounds? Hey, look, it's good. Golf is fine. But always play with leaders of countries and people that can help us! Don't play with your friends all the time.\"\n\nKlobuchar's remark comes weeks after the sixth Democratic debate in Los Angeles, during which she attempted to make an electability argument as a senator from a purple state who can \"bring in the rural and suburban areas.\" After seeming lost on the debate stage throughout last summer and autumn, Klobuchar left the smaller stage in December having had a more relaxed and assured performance.\n\n\"She's gotten better as these debates have gone on,\" political analyst David Axelrod said on CNN after the senator fire back at South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg over his experience and political resume.\n\nThe moderate candidate, who's is currently polling among the second tier of presidential candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic nomination, has recently declared that she's well-positioned to defeat Trump in the upcoming general election.\n\n\"I can appeal to independents, too,\" she told supporters during a visit to Mount Washington Valley this week. \"I'm from the middle of the country, where I can win with steel workers in northern Minnesota and with farmers.\"\n\nIn this week's Economist/YouGov poll, Klobuchar came in fifth place in the crowded Democratic 2020 field, with four percent support. Former Vice President Joe Biden maintained his longstanding lead with 29 percent, while Senator Bernie Sanders came in second with 19 percent. Sanders was closely followed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, who garnered 18 percent.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Amy Klobuchar", "Democrats", "Donald Trump", "2020 Election"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 19:26:09 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The moderate 2020 candidate has recently declared that she's well-positioned to defeat Trump in the upcoming general election.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://g.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/favicon-96x96.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Politics,Amy Klobuchar,2020 Election,Democrats,Donald Trump", "description": "The moderate 2020 candidate has recently declared that she's well-positioned to defeat Trump in the upcoming general election.", "fb": {"app_id": 245537789135954, "pages": 18343191100}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Newsweek", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/klobuchar-jabs-trump-spending-1-5-days-2019-golf-club-i-spent-0-days-golf-course-1479997", "title": "Klobuchar jabs Trump for spending one of five days in 2019 at a golf club: \"I spent 0 days on the golf course\"", "description": "The moderate 2020 candidate has recently declared that she's well-positioned to defeat Trump in the upcoming general election.", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1557053/amy-klobuchar.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek", "published_time": "2020-01-01T19:26:09-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T23:20:10-05:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@newsweek", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Klobuchar jabs Trump for spending one of five days in 2019 at a golf club: \"I spent 0 days on the golf course\"", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/klobuchar-jabs-trump-spending-1-5-days-2019-golf-club-i-spent-0-days-golf-course-1479997", "description": "The moderate 2020 candidate has recently declared that she's well-positioned to defeat Trump in the upcoming general election.", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1557053/amy-klobuchar.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://g.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://g.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/browserconfig.xml"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.newsweek.com/klobuchar-jabs-trump-spending-1-5-days-2019-golf-club-i-spent-0-days-golf-course-1479997"}
