There was heavy traffic block in the city for almost four to five hours, forcing many of the shops in the city to down shutters by noon in anticipation of the traffic block.Banerji Road, through which one of the rallies passed to the protest venue at Marine Drive, along Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium-High Court stretch was fully occupied by the protesters. They were seen walking across the footpaths as well. All the vehicles, including private buses, kept off the road leaving commuters in the lurch. Metro came to the rescue of commuters. The Metro ridership reached more than one lakh at 8pm. All the Metro stations were crowded. In the routes where there are no Metro services, passengers had a tough time.A KSRTC bus was stuck amidst the crowd for almost an hour, while many had to wait for hours on end to get out of a theatre complex in the city as Banerji Road was fully occupied by the protesters. \u201cWe have to go to Vypeen side. So, we have to take a U-turn. But we are unable to move an inch even forward, let along the U-turn. We have been trapped here for more than an hour,\u201d said a passenger on the KSRTC bus.With motorists taking other roads like MG Road following the blockade on Banerji Road, traffic bottlenecks extended to all across the city centre. Even ambulances got trapped in traffic snarls. With police focusing on the venue at Marine Drive and Shanmugham Road , there was nobody to regulate the traffic on MG Road and Chittoor Road", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Kochi news", "Kochi latest news", "Kochi news live", "Kochi news today", "Today news Kochi", "Shanmugham Road", "paralyses city", "Chittoor road", "Banerji road", "anti-caa protest"], "tags": ["Delhi Air Pollution", "Chittoor Road", "Fire in Mumbai", "Chennai Weather", "Mumbai Rains", "Shanmugham Road", "Bangalore Temperature", "Hyderabad Rain", "Delhi Temperature", "Srinagar encounter", "Banerji Road", "Delhi Smog"], "authors": ["Tnn"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The rally carried out by Muslim outfits against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) paralysed the city on Wedn", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The rally carried out by Muslim outfits against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) paralysed the city on Wedn", "keywords": "Kochi news, Kochi latest news, Kochi news live, Kochi news today, Today news Kochi,Shanmugham Road,paralyses city,Chittoor road,Banerji road,anti-caa protest", "robots": "NOODP", "og": {"title": "Anti-CAA protest paralyses Kochi | Kochi News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/anti-caa-protest-paralyses-city/articleshow/73062537.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73062536,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-59518,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "The rally carried out by Muslim outfits against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) paralysed the city on Wedn", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/anti-caa-protest-paralyses-city/articleshow/73062537.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73062536,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-59518,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "Anti-CAA protest paralyses Kochi | Kochi News - Times of India", "description": "The rally carried out by Muslim outfits against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) paralysed the city on Wedn", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "news_keywords": "Shanmugham Road,paralyses city,Chittoor road,Banerji road,anti-caa protest", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/anti-caa-protest-paralyses-city/articleshow/73062537.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 227797153941209, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/anti-caa-protest-paralyses-city/articleshow/73062537.cms"}
