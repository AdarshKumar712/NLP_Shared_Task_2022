The new couple was just pictured jetting off to spend the holidays together in New Zealand, where he owns a $9.2 million lakefront ranch.\n\nA source close to Lauer told Page Six, \u201cMatt and Shamin have known each other for many years, as she spends a lot of time in the Hamptons, as does he. They very recently began dating, she is a lovely woman.\u201d Abas did not immediately respond to emails.\n\nLauer, 62, and Abas were photographed boarding a flight to New Zealand together on December 19, In Touch first reported.\n\nWhile there have been numerous reports of Lauer spending time with new girlfriends in the Hamptons since his split with Roque, 53, Abas is the first woman he has been confirmed to have been seeing on a serious basis.\n\nAbas\u2019 eponymous New York City-based firm has worked with clients including Ferrari North America and Jet Aviation.\n\nShe also works with fancy Hamptons golf club The Bridge on an invite-only classic car exhibition. Golf-loving Lauer is believed to be a member of the swanky club in Noyack, which is very close to his former marital home with Roque\n\nLauer and Roque, who together have three children aged between 13 and 18, separated after Lauer was fired by NBC in November 2017 following allegations of sexual misconduct, which he has denied.\n\nThis past October, Lauer\u2019s former NBC News colleague Brooke Nevils alleged that he raped her in his hotel room when they were covering the 2014 Sochi Olympics. He has strongly denied her claim, stating that the sex was consensual.\n\nIn 2017 Lauer bought the lease on the 16,000-acre New Zealand sheep and cattle farm Hunter Valley Station. It reportedly includes more than eight miles of lakefront land bordering Lake Hawea and Lake Wanaka, eight miles of riverfront along the Hunter River, a five-bedroom farmhouse and an assortment of other farm buildings and fishing huts.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Page Six", "annette roque", "celebrity dating", "matt lauer", "today show"], "tags": ["annette roque", "celebrity dating", "today show", "matt lauer"], "authors": ["Emily Smith", "December"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A source close to Lauer told Page Six, \"Matt and Shamin have known each other for many years, as she spends a lot of time in the Hamptons, as does he.\"", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/nypost-2016/static/images/apple-icons/pagesix/apple-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2019 NYP Holdings.
