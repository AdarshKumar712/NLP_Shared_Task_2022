The markets have been volatile since the pandemic hit the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump was concerned that doing too much to tackle Coronavirus could send the markets into a panic, according to the Financial Times. The newspaper quotes an unnamed administration source.\n\n\u201cJared [Kushner] had been arguing that testing too many people, or ordering too many ventilators, would spook the markets and so we just shouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cThat advice worked far more powerfully on [Trump] than what the scientists were saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thinks they always exaggerate,\u201d the FT quoted their source as saying.\n\nThis \u201cunnamed Trump confidante\u201d reportedly speaks to President Trump frequently and would be in a position to gauge his mindset. However, Trump has slammed anonymously sourced reports in the past.\n\nThe FT investigation also quotes another unnamed official who explained what it\u2019s like to advice the President.\n\nGiving Trump advice is like \u201cbringing fruits to the volcano\u201d, the official said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to appease a great force that\u2019s impervious to reason.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has been widely criticized for failing to act fast enough or decisively enough when the virus hit.\n\nThe President initially downplayed the severity of the disease and fought with Democratic governors. He has since pushed to reopen the economy against expert advice.\n\nFollow Darragh Roche on Twitter", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["COVID-19", "ventilators", "Jared Kushner"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu May 14 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://2vwlfu3ynqxb3npfhm3m8lde-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Politicususa_Favicon_32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Trump Worried Too Much Coronavirus Testing Would Panic the Stock Market", "description": "Donald Trump was reluctant to do too much Coronavirus preparation in case it panicked the stock market, according to a new report.
