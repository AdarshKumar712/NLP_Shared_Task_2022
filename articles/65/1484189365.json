Some famous hotels in the capital have already stopped taking room reservations and a 14,000-room shortfall is forecast. The government expects that the Olympics will attract about 10 million visitors, according to Japan Times.\n\nThe country has been seeing a tourist boom in recent years. Japan saw more than 31 million international visitors in 2018, including 1.5 million from the U.S., according to figures from the Japan National Tourist Organization.\n\nFinal preparations for the 2020 games are underway; the new national stadium, which will be used as the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies, was completed earlier this month. The official Olympics mascot, a half-superhero, half-robot name Miraitowa, has also been unveiled.\n\nThis is the second time the Olympics has been held in Tokyo. In 1964, the city became the first in Asia to host the games.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Hillary Leung"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 07:21:25 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Tourists flying to Japan with Japan Airlines this summer can win free tickets to a surprise destination in the country", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Tourists flying to Japan with Japan Airlines this summer can win free tickets to a surprise destination in the country", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/E01JHiqdR.dlBQ99uJ.MPw--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/31876f8dd6471a53320c5e528105b7e1", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/E01JHiqdR.dlBQ99uJ.MPw--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/31876f8dd6471a53320c5e528105b7e1"}, "title": "Japan Airlines Is Giving Away 50,000 Free Flights to Tourists.
