Maybe the most intriguing of the state\u2019s signature beverages is the Old Fashioned \u2014 with brandy, of course. This supper club staple may be experiencing a comeback nationwide, but in Wisconsin, it never left \u2014 and the reason why may surprise you.\n\nThe Wisconsin Old Fashioned\n\nTraditionally an Old Fashioned consists of whiskey, bitters, and sugar \u2014 but Wisconsinites have their own traditions, starting with brandy.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s love affair with brandy goes back before prohibition to the Chicago World\u2019s Fair in 1893. German immigrants settled in Milwaukee traveled in droves to Chicago to experience the wonders the fair had promised and there, found exactly what they\u2019d been looking for.\n\nThe Korbel brothers came from the West Coast slinging bottles of brandy, a sweet, typically European spirit that hadn\u2019t quite infiltrated American culture. For the new Milwaukeeans in attendance, the Korbel brothers\u2019 drink was a welcome taste of home. Before long, brandy was a regular replacement for other liquors in mixed drinks \u2014 which is how it ended up in our Old Fashioneds.\n\nAnother quirk, Wisconsin Old Fashioneds include a wash \u2014 that is, a sweet or sour soda mixer \u2014 and muddled orange and cherry, a riff that traces back to prohibition, when low-quality alcohol necessitated stronger, sugary mixers to make the drink bearable.\n\nTasty and potent, the recipe stuck. Today, Wisconsinites tout their preferences with pride. \u201cI\u2019m a brandy sweet drinker, through and through,\u201d said Marie Howard, a lifelong Wisconsin resident. \u201cAdd the cherry garnish and you\u2019ve got a perfect drink.\u201d\n\nCocktails and Community\n\nIt makes sense that 100 years after turning the Old Fashioned into something new and distinct, Wisconsin bars and restaurants continue to serve up creative takes on the beloved classic.\n\nJill Mirate, General Manager of Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery Milwaukee, loves honoring Wisconsin traditions in unconventional ways. \u201cWisconsinites have always been rulebreakers, and they can appreciate something creative and offbeat,\u201d said Mirate. \u201cThat adventurous attitude makes the whole thing fun.\u201d\n\nToday, Rock Bottom Milwaukee is mixing it up with its new Root Beer Old Fashioned. Made with Wild Turkey Bourbon, root beer and orange bitters, this cocktail is sure to warm you up and satisfy your sweet tooth. Pair it with the Kolsch-battered fish and chips, and you\u2019ll be feasting on a remixed Wisconsin classic.\n\nRight in the heart of downtown, Rock Bottom Milwaukee carries not only the state\u2019s official beverage, but also the distinct spirit of camaraderie found in every supper club, corner bar and neighborhood restaurant in the 414. This winter, cozy up with friends over dark, rich craft beers, seasonal cocktails, and hearty American fare \u2014 and if you\u2019re old fashioned about your Old Fashioneds, don\u2019t fret. The Milwaukee staple is available year-round in all its classic glory.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s as much about community as it is Old Fashioneds, fish frys or any other Milwaukee tradition,\u201d Mirate said.\n\nRock Bottom Milwaukee offers an extended happy hour Monday through Friday from 4-7 p.m., an ever-changing craft beer list and a warm, inviting atmosphere made for friends, loved ones, and plenty of Old Fashioneds.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Rock Bottom Restaurant"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Downtown restaurant offers a new take on the state's classic cocktail, the Old Fashioned.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://urbanmilwaukee.com/wp-content/themes/urbanmilwaukee_responsive/images/um_favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Downtown restaurant offers a new take on the state's classic cocktail, the Old Fashioned.", "author": "Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery", "fb": {"app_id": 142344658820}, "og": {"site_name": "Urban Milwaukee", "description": "Downtown restaurant offers a new take on the state's classic cocktail, the Old Fashioned.", "title": "Sponsored: Exploring Wisconsin Culture with Rock Bottom Milwaukee", "url": "https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2019/12/31/sponsored-exploring-wisconsin-culture-with-rock-bottom-milwaukee/", "image": {"identifier": "https://urbanmilwaukee.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Picture1j.jpg", "width": 974, "height": 639}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@urbanmilwaukee"}, "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "https://urbanmilwaukee.com"}, "canonical_link": "https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2019/12/31/sponsored-exploring-wisconsin-culture-with-rock-bottom-milwaukee/"}
