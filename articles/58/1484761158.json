Eric Greitens, hours before his resignation, signed the give-and-take tax law. It took effect on January 1 for the start of the 2020 tax year.\n\nIn the US, only 44 states have an income tax. Although Missouri\u2019s new rate is low, the lowest is North Carolina at 2.5%.\n\nSara Paben, the owner of a Columbia cafe, said after meeting with her CPA, there are a lot of changes that are being made.\n\n\u201cWith sales tax and state tax, small businesses get taxed tremendously. So, it really does help with that because with our CPA this a couple days ago we were looking over things and there are a lot of changes being made so it really accommodates for those changes to be not so drastic,\u201d Paben said.\n\nThe Missouri Budget Project, which analyzes financial issues, estimates the tax cut could save 28-million dollars for low income residents.\n\nIndividual income tax rates were also cut from 5.9% to 5.4%, which also went into effect January 1.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["tax rate", "tax cut", "law", "missouri", "finances", "businesses", "corporations", ""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Kelley Collins", "Komu Reporter"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Missouri\u2019s new corporate tax rate dropped from 6.25% to 4%; one of the lowest rates in the US.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2015 Louisiana Television Broadcasting LLC", "description": "Missouri\u2019s new corporate tax rate dropped from 6.25% to 4%; one of the lowest rates in the US.", "keywords": "tax rate,tax cut,law,missouri,finances,businesses,corporations,", "news_keywords": "tax rate,tax cut,law,missouri,finances,businesses,corporations,", "Date": "2020-01-02", "Last-Modified": "2020-01-02 07:33:32", "fb": {"admins": 1839921640, "app_id": 120937133004}, "fb_title": "Missouri businesses could see tax cuts in 2020", "og": {"site_name": "KOMU.com", "title": "Missouri businesses could see tax cuts in 2020", "description": "Missouri\u2019s new corporate tax rate dropped from 6.25% to 4%; one of the lowest rates in the US.", "url": "https://www.komu.com/news/missouri-businesses-could-see-tax-cuts-in-2020/", "image": "https://dcer237tfveol.cloudfront.net/v2/qYo3yHFW_nygtmF6WJoZ7AfQ2KYlooVfOk_lAR0qLO_7246OHIgazQNtqu6lDu9lqo2IyNsKVc1YDxJemYnSdU_t6dVY4NMKUq-WuFtW5-SA", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "_iGbs0FP7Rbr77xHU8-VCo6kmtCLK-FyM5Ye1LWsqYE", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@KOMUNews", "title": "Missouri businesses could see tax cuts in 2020", "description": "Missouri\u2019s new corporate tax rate dropped from 6.25% to 4%; one of the lowest rates in the US.", "image": "https://dcer237tfveol.cloudfront.net/v2/y6HzPVZW854rnfqSw-vOYAE89MkKwzkcZQeZaCEAmO9T8PbU6wrr-RzTjXzGGIB_oVG1TO01Syx07oCnz0HxakPg7m9PZdGireOMtmTkIriw"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.komu.com/news/missouri-businesses-could-see-tax-cuts-in-2020/"}
