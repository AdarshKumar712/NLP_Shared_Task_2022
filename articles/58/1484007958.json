Plant-based meats are on the rise. And kale is still having a moment.\n\nThose are some of the foods predicted to be among the most popular American eats in 2020.\n\nAnd when Americans nosh, increasingly they will forgo the restaurant reservation and choose to chow down in their own kitchen. Roughly 46% of dinner meals purchased from restaurants are now eaten at diners\u2019 homes, according to the NPD Group.\n\n\u201dThe biggest shift in consumer behavior right now is our preference to consume food at home,\u2019\u2019 says David Portalatin, NPD\u2019s food industry adviser, who noted that Americans are taking advantage of the ability to use an app to order from a restaurant, or buying groceries online, then picking them up or having them delivered.\n\nFeel-good food\n\nA key driver for what diners are ordering and buying is a focus on health, as Americans seek out what they believe to be more nutritious snacks and meals.\n\n\u201dOver the last year, we\u2019ve seen how important it is for people to feel good about what they eat and order, driving an even greater increase in socially conscious and health-conscious dining,\u2019\u2019 said Jeanette Mellinger, head of Uber Eats User Research\n\nThe foods Uber Eats expects to be most in demand next year include oat milk, the savory noodle soup known as udon, and foods made with ingredients perceived to be health boosters like collagen.\n\nThe wellness focus fueling these shifting tastes is different from health movements of the past, Portalatin says.\n\n\u201dToday\u2019s wellness goals are less about things like diet and exercise and more about this idea of living well,\u2019\u2019 he says. Shoppers will be loading their carts with items that are natural, minimally processed or deemed to be super foods with medicinal benefits like microgreens, the plant ashwagandha or the algae spirulina.\n\n\u201cWe may still eat something indulgent like chicken and waffles,\u2019\u2019 Portalatin says, \u201cbut it may have a Manuka honey topping to make us feel better about it.\u2019\u2019\n\nTastes expand globally\n\nThe craving for international flavors that has fueled the popularity of dishes like udon and the Vietnamese soup pho is expected to continue. And foods like kimchi may satisfy more than one trend, offering a taste of a global cuisine while promising potential health benefits.\n\nKorean foods have been in demand for a while. Orders restaurants place with distributors for the shaved beef known as Bulgogi have experienced a triple-digit rate of growth, Portalatin says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also seeing [the popularity of] anything from the Mediterranean [and] North Africa,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cSo flavors like harissa, and tahini, Aleppo chili. Those kinds of flavors and cuisines from those parts of the world will continue to gain momentum in 2020.\u2019\u2019\n\nAmericans also love to tweak the old with the new. They may be interested in trying a dipping sauce made with the Indonesian pepper paste sambal, for instance, if they can put a dollop on top of old-fashioned chicken tenders.\n\nRestaurants that take culinary favorites and \u201cinnovate or elevate the form of those foods in some way, that\u2019s what the consumer will really embrace,\u2019\u2019 he says, adding that\u2019s what helped ignite the chicken sandwich frenzy that set off a fierce competition between Popeyes and its fast food rivals earlier this year.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cnot that a breaded chicken sandwich is anything new,\u2019\u2019 Portalatin says. \u201cThat\u2019s been around forever. But when you give consumers a new option to try, everybody goes crazy and rushes out to get\u2019\u2019 it.\n\nMore growth for plant-based options\n\nBreakthroughs in taste and texture, and a desire for more nutritious options will also help spur the growing popularity of plant-based foods.\n\nDairy alternatives, like almond milk, draw a bigger share of consumers than plant-based meats, according to the NPD Group. But meatless patties like the Impossible Burger and those produced by Beyond Meat propelled the plant-based meat category to $946.6 million in sales as of October, a 10.2% spike as compared to 2018, according to Nielsen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a relatively small behavior,\u2019\u2019 Portalatin says, adding that U.S. restaurants sell 280 million veggie burgers annually as compared to nearly 8 billion burgers made from beef. \u201cBut it has seen phenomenal growth.\u2019\u2019\n\nAmong consumers, 16% use plant-based alternatives to dairy or meat products on a consistent basis and 89% of that group do not identify as vegan or vegetarian, Portalatin says,\n\n\u201dI think you will see consumers continue to seek protein and other nutritional benefits from plant-based sources,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u201cwhether that comes in the form of a snack food that is made from high-protein plant ingredients, or whether it\u2019s a plant-based version of meat.\u201d\n\nSome Instagram friendly items like starfruit are expected to maintain their recent popularity in the new year, Uber Eats says, while a few other top trends have been perennial picks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed a few veggie favorites are here to stay,\u2019\u2019 Mellinger says. \u201cOur customers continue to enjoy cabbage, cauliflower, kale, and Brussels sprouts. And given this healthful eating trend globally, we don\u2019t expect those to go anywhere anytime soon.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Usa Today Network", "Andy Grimm", "S.
