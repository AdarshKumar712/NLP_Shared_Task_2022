Locals reported being cast into darkness in the middle of the day.\n\n\"We are used to the ritual and rush of bringing in washing, turning air cons off, closing windows and doors, before a big dust storm hits,\" Ashleigh Hull from the rural town of Dubbo told AFP.\n\nThis one was \"more spectacular\" than the typical dust storm, she added.\n\n\"It was honestly like an apocalyptic movie, a huge wave coming towards us, really quite impressive, but I just wish it actually brought a good amount of rain, not dust.\"\n\nViolent hail storms pelted the capital Canberra Monday, with footage showing the storm ripping branches off trees.\n\nEmergency services were warning people there to \"move cars undercover and away from trees and power lines\".\n\nThe bureau of meteorology told people in the southeast of New South Wales to be \"well prepared\" for the approaching storm.\n\n\"Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging, locally destructive winds, large, possibly giant hailstones and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding in the warning area over the next several hours,\" the bureau said.\n\nIn Victoria, where bushfires continue to smoulder, heavy rainfall overnight was welcomed in fire grounds in the north, but authorities said it also brought with it new dangers.\n\nState Premier Daniel Andrews said the rain meant \"much more dangerous conditions\" for those operating heavy machinery to get into areas damaged by bushfires, while landslides complicated efforts to open up closed roads.\n\nThe wet weather has brought a reprieve for many fire grounds along the east coast, but authorities remain on high alert, warning that the bushfire season still has weeks to run.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Jan 20 04:56:03 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The southern city of Melbourne was lashed by huge hailstones late Sunday and fire-ravaged parts of Victoria state overnight received heavy rainfall, prompting new extreme weather alerts.
