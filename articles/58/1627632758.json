(@johnminchillo / Twitter)\n\nThis analysis was originally published by the Center for Public Integrity.\n\nBefore he was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, George Floyd, like millions of African Americans, lost his job because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAfter months of a pandemic that has seen African Americans die at almost double their numbers in the U.S. population, and generations of police and white supremacist violence against Black people, a mix of rage and despair is once again burning across the country.\n\nThe police violence and the impact of the pandemic are two sides of the same coin.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened with Floyd, and in the history of the U.S., is about whether Black folks can execute power over what their lives are going to look like,\u201d said Jessica Fulton, vice president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research organization in Washington, D.C., focused on ideas that improve the socioeconomic status of African Americans.\n\nIn a nation radically altered by the coronavirus, Floyd\u2019s death reminds us that some things have not changed.\n\nHere at Ms., our team is continuing to report through this global health crisis\u2014doing what we can to keep you informed and up-to-date on some of the most underreported issues of this pandemic. We ask that you consider supporting our work to bring you substantive, unique reporting\u2014we can\u2019t do it without you. Support our independent reporting and truth-telling for as little as $5 per month.\n\nA new report by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) states that racial and economic inequality have made Black workers\u2014who comprise about 12 percent of the workforce\u2014most vulnerable to the coronavirus.\n\nAs of April, less than half of the adult Black population was employed. Many of those African Americans who were working are part of the army of low-paid essential workers, risking their lives for a paycheck. (Black women and Latinas are the backbone of this army.) And they are more likely to be uninsured, so they do not get medical care until they fall severely ill.\n\nMore than 50 years after the landmark Kerner Commission report\u2014which called out the nation\u2019s systemic racism after Los Angeles, Detroit, Newark and other cities erupted in flames\u2014the coronavirus has pushed this same unfinished agenda back into the spotlight.\n\nIn between Kerner, we have had other moments and other reports and other opportunities to address the economic and racial inequality that abet police violence\u2014Los Angeles following the acquittal of police officers in the beating of Rodney King in 1992, and in Ferguson after a police officer killed Michael Brown in 2014.\n\nYet here we are. George Floyd is dead. And millions of African Americans are unemployed.\n\nThe income and wealth divide between whites and Blacks amounts to an even more critical problem during the pandemic. White families hold five times as much cash in savings, checking, money market accounts and other liquid assets as Black people, according to the EPI report. In 2018, median household income for whites was 70 percent higher than for Blacks.\n\nThis racial wealth gap means that African Americans are less prepared than whites to weather the COVID-19 storm. While African Americans experienced economic gains over the past few decades, the pandemic\u2014like the recession from 2007 to 2009\u2014threatens to erode what progress they have made. However, the gains never erased the persistent wage and wealth gap between Blacks and whites.\n\nSeveral Black protesters have said, \u201cIf the police don\u2019t get you, the coronavirus will.\u201d\n\nFloyd pleaded for mercy as Officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck until Floyd could no longer breathe. His death triggered the protests of the past week.\n\nBut the issues that have driven people to the streets are the same as those identified in the 1968 Kerner report. Over the years, the report has become a benchmark for racial progress. Though it is typically cited for indicting a white, paternalistic perspective in the news media, it also proclaimed \u201cwhite racism\u201d as the catalyst for the unrest, condemned police brutality and proposed destroying structural barriers to racial equality.\n\n\u201cPeople understand the lynching of a Black man on video to be linked to a movement where overt white supremacy is surging,\u201d said Eric Tang, a University of Texas at Austin associate professor whose work focuses on race and social movements in urban America. \u201cAt the same time, what we see is the way in which this unrest intersects with broader issues, just as we saw in the late 1960s when unrest tied to housing, unemployment and income inequality ripped through Black ghettos.\u201d\n\nValerie Wilson, an economist and co-author of the EPI report on Black workers, agrees that the issues are the same today.\n\n\u201cThere were a number of recommendations to address those issues,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cBut those recommendations were not taken up. So, what we have seen since is that we still have the same problems.\u201d\n\nThe recommendations were never consistently pursued by Democrats or Republicans. President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who appointed the commission, was unhappy with its conclusions. President Richard M. Nixon liked them even less. His law-and-order rhetoric echoes today in President Donald Trump\u2019s response to the thousands of people whose calls for justice could result in what Johnson wanted from the commission\u2014preventing more unrest from happening.\n\nIn his last minutes of life, penned to the pavement, George Floyd said, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d His life ended in the same way as thousands of Americans who have suffered from COVID-19. They could not breathe.\n\nMore than 50 years after the Kerner report, we cannot continue to separate police violence from racial and economic inequality. They are two sides of the same coin that is stealing Black lives.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and the response by federal, state and local authorities is fast-moving. During this time, Ms. is keeping a focus on aspects of the crisis\u2014especially as it impacts women and their families\u2014often not reported by mainstream media.
