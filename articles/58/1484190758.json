Park Rangers pommelled Cardiff City 6-1 in their first Championship game of the year.\n\nThe Anglo-Nigerians scored and provided assists to help \u200eMark Warburton\u2019s men end their recent unimpressive run of form, having failed to secure victory in their previous four matches.\n\nEze ignited the flurry of goals nine minutes into the encounter, sending a sublime cross to Nahki Wells, who in turn headed home the effort for QPR\u2019s opener.\n\nOsayi-Samuel doubled the lead in the 27th minute and completed his brace four minutes before half-time, beating two of his markers before firing his effort beyond goalkeeper Neil Etheridge.\n\nJust three minutes into the second half, Eze shone again, setting up Wells for his second goal in the encounter.\n\nThe 21-year-old midfielder then grabbed a goal of his own in the 57th minute after benefitting from Ilias Chair\u2019s assist before Wells sealed the victory to render Will Vaulks\u2019 late strike a consolation goal.\n\nWith the result, QPR climbed to 15th in the Championship table with 35 points from 26 games and will hope to continue their impressive performances against Swansea City on Sunday.", "keywords": [],
