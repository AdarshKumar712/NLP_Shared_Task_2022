The alleged incident is said to have happened in the third week of December because Fitzgerald\u2019s mother, Patricia, was found dead inside her house on Dec. 20.\n\nThe star, who played the role of Stark Girl in the first \u201cCaptain America\u201d movie, has been sent to jail on a bond of $500,000. As of late, no comment has been made by her attorney and it is also not clear if Fitzgerald even had someone who could come forward to comment from her side.\n\nApart from being an actress, Fitzgerald was also a producer and has produced more than seven movies and a documentary, which is still in production. Fitzgerald also directed a short movie called \u201cThe Creeps\u201d in 2017, which has a score of 8 out of 10 on IMDb. She also served as an assistant to director Joe Johnston, the helmer of the first \u201cCaptain America\u201d movie.\n\nOn the other hand, TMZ reported that police came to the area after responding to a distress call. They arrested the accused from the crime scene.\n\nMeanwhile, a report from another media outlet stated that Patricia was getting ready to move back to Kansas City after living more than two decades in the area of Houston. Patricia\u2019s brother, Gary Hunziker, noted that he got to know about the details of her sister\u2019s death, but the details do not matter anymore because he has lost his beloved sister.\n\n\u201cWe were shocked. But it does not matter the circumstances \u2013 the loss of a sister is what it is all about,\u201d Hunziker said.\n\nAccording to the same publication, Fitzgerald has been sent to Johnson County Jail. The actress was sent into custody after police explained that the people involved in such heinous crime have been identified, but the local authorities are still investigating the matter to gain more details.\n\nPhoto: AFP / Johannes EISELE", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["movies", "news", "captain america", "actress", "arrested", "on the charge", "of murder", "mollie fitzgerald", "the first avenger", "kansas city", "allegedly stabbing", "the creeps", "joe johnston", "entertainment news", "crime news", "tmz", "johnson county jail", "chris evans", "patricia", ""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 22:33:58 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Mollie Fitzgerald, who played a minor role in the movie \"Captain America: The First Avenger,\" was arrested on the charge of allegedly killing her own mother in the city of Kansas.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "movies, news, captain america, actress, arrested, on the charge, of murder, mollie fitzgerald, the first avenger, kansas city, allegedly stabbing, the creeps, joe johnston, entertainment news, crime news, tmz, johnson county jail, chris evans, patricia,", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/captain-america-actress-arrested-charge-murder-2895055", "title": "'Captain America' Actress Arrested On The Charge Of Murder", "description": "Mollie Fitzgerald, who played a minor role in the movie \"Captain America: The First Avenger,\" was arrested on the charge of allegedly killing her own mother in the city of Kansas.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2019/12/29/five-people-were-injured-in-a-stabbing-attack.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2019/12/29/five-people-were-injured-in-a-stabbing-attack.jpg", "height": 672, "width": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "Aayush Sharma", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T22:33:58-05:00", "published_time": "2020-01-01T22:33:58-05:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Captain America' Actress Arrested On The Charge Of Murder", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/captain-america-actress-arrested-charge-murder-2895055", "description": "Mollie Fitzgerald, who played a minor role in the movie \"Captain America: The First Avenger,\" was arrested on the charge of allegedly killing her own mother in the city of Kansas.", "image": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2019/12/29/five-people-were-injured-in-a-stabbing-attack.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-config": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#000000", "keywords": "movies, news, captain america, actress, arrested, on the charge, of murder, mollie fitzgerald, the first avenger, kansas city, allegedly stabbing, the creeps, joe johnston, entertainment news, crime news, tmz, johnson county jail, chris evans, patricia,", "author": "Aayush Sharma", "description": "Mollie Fitzgerald, who played a minor role in the movie \"Captain America: The First Avenger,\" was arrested on the charge of allegedly killing her own mother in the city of Kansas."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.com/captain-america-actress-arrested-charge-murder-2895055"}
