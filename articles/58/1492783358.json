The movement, founded in mid-November by a group of four friends from Bologna in response to Salvini\u2019s threat to \u201cliberate\u201d Emilia-Romagna from the left, has attracted a huge following, with thousands of supporters cramming into piazzas across the country in recent months.\n\nThe next show of strength is planned for Bologna next Sunday, a week before a regional election that is seen as an important test for the stability of the national government coalition between the centre-left Democratic party (PD) and the Five Star Movement (M5S). The precarious alliance came together last summer after Salvini\u2019s League party was forced out of government following his failed attempt to force snap elections.\n\nSupport for the League has dwindled but it is still Italy\u2019s biggest party, and winning in Emilia-Romagna would be a major coup for Salvini and his regional partners, the smaller far-right party, Brothers of Italy, and Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia.\n\nThe coalition\u2019s candidate, Lucia Borgonzoni, is polling slightly behind Stefano Bonaccini, the incumbent president from the PD. If Bonaccini manages to maintain that lead in a region where the League has galvanised support in many areas, mostly because of disillusionment with the left, then much of it would be due to the influence of the Sardines. \u201cThis is the main importance of the Sardines, to mobilise people and build the fight against Salvini,\u201d said Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Rome\u2019s Luiss University.\n\nThe debut Sardines demonstration in Bologna attracted an estimated 15,000 people, and quickly spread across the country, culminating with a national rally in Rome in December that brought an estimated 40,000. A host of other events have taken place in smaller towns and cities.\n\nHow the movement develops will depend on the outcome of the vote in Emilia-Romagna. A meeting of national representatives is planned after the elections, leading many to believe it could become a political party, despite denials by Mattia Santori, one of the founders.\n\n\u201cIf Salvini\u2019s coalition wins in Emilia-Romagna, which would mean a political earthquake for the PD, then there could be the possibility of the Sardines transforming themselves into an organised structure as the PD\u2019s failure would leave a void in the left,\u201d said Panarari. \u201cIf the PD is able to resist, and thanks also to the Sardines\u2019 ability to mobilise voters, I think the leaders of existing leftwing parties could invite the most prominent Sardines members to join them.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Italy", "Matteo Salvini", "Protest", "Silvio Berlusconi", "Europe", "World news"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "publish_date": "Sun Jan 12 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Thousands expected in Bologna in campaign against far-right League", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/fee5e2d638d1c35f6d501fa397e53329/152x152.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Thousands expected in Bologna in campaign against far-right League", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Angela Giuffrida", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab2890674203208c47a86fed50100aab37b13194/0_28_3883_2330/master/3883.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2694b48f64b2ce43a50ef6ef003aaa30", "keywords": "Italy,Matteo Salvini,Protest,Silvio Berlusconi,Europe,World news", "news_keywords": "Italy,Matteo Salvini,Protest,Silvio Berlusconi,Europe,World news", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/12/sardines-demonstration-bologna-salvini-far-right", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab2890674203208c47a86fed50100aab37b13194/0_28_3883_2330/master/3883.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e5b08113459b0906db10b0570358dcf9", "description": "Thousands expected in Bologna in campaign against far-right League", "type": "article", "title": "Italy\u2019s Sardines movement calls mass demo to squeeze out Salvini", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/angela-giuffrida", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "World news", "published_time": "2020-01-12T09:35:31.000Z", "tag": "Italy,Matteo Salvini,Protest,Silvio Berlusconi,Europe,World news", "modified_time": "2020-01-12T09:35:31.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/12/sardines-demonstration-bologna-salvini-far-right?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/12/sardines-demonstration-bologna-salvini-far-right?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/12/sardines-demonstration-bologna-salvini-far-right", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/12/sardines-demonstration-bologna-salvini-far-right?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab2890674203208c47a86fed50100aab37b13194/0_28_3883_2330/master/3883.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d399eb466f3d286afd2947624a758460", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/12/sardines-demonstration-bologna-salvini-far-right"}
