They spent the majority of the decade as a playoff team behind a \u201ccore four\u201d of players that became larger-than-life figures in the city of Memphis.\n\nThough all the Z-BOunds, \u201cCaptain Clutch\u201d moments, First-Team All-Defense plays, and Gasol dimes had to eventually fade away, the Memphis Grizzlies are entering an era that could perhaps deliver the most success in franchise history.\n\nIn year one of the full rebuild, the Grizzlies already have a trio of players that could usher them into this glorious age.\n\nJaren Jackson Jr. defies traditional basketball, as he\u2019s a 7-footer that launches six 3-pointers a game, handles the ball like a guard, and possesses the post footwork of an elite big man.\n\nBrandon Clarke, acquired in a trade for franchise great Mike Conley, is a high-energy big man that could defend multiple positions, protect the rim, score with incredible efficiency, and space the floor.\n\nJa Morant is the superstar that puts the Grizzlies on the map with his nifty ball-handling, elite athleticism, flashy passing, and the \u201c**** you\u201d edge that\u2019s captivating to the national media.\n\nBehind this trio, and a bright, forward-thinking front office, the Memphis Grizzlies are entering the new decade with hope beyond making noise. They\u2019re looking to build a sustainable product that could ultimately bring a Finals parade to Beale Street before 2030 begins.\n\nZach Kleiman, Jason Wexler, and company are off to a fantastic start with this plan, as they\u2019re surpassing most expectations this season. They got this trio, a modern coach that\u2019s integrated a beautiful, free-flowing system, and a platoon of assets in the form of young players, veteran contracts, and draft capital. It\u2019s a modern basketball enthusiast\u2019s dream.\n\nHowever, there are some things they need to do in order to bring sustainable success this decade.\n\nFind Ja Morant\u2019s running mate\n\nJaren Jackson Jr. has his fellow frontcourt partner-in-crime of the future in Brandon Clarke. The Grizzlies must find Ja Morant\u2019s running mate.\n\nHow this player joins the fold remains to be seen.\n\nIf you were to pick someone on this current team, De\u2019Anthony Melton seems like the perfect option. He\u2019s already an elite defender for his position and can alleviate pressure off Ja on that end of the floor. Offensively, he\u2019s flashed potential as a 3-level scorer and a secondary playmaker. In the process, he won\u2019t take shots away from Morant or Jackson \u2014 which has been a complaint about some members in the starting lineup.\n\nThe question with Melton is about his position. Do they see him as someone with enough size to be a starting 2-guard every night? Or, does he transition into a backup point guard in the mold of Fred VanVleet \u2014 one that handles floor general responsibilities in the second unit, but can play alongside the starter in crunchtime?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell, but it could come in the form of the draft \u2014 pls, Jalen Green.\n\nOr in free agency.\n\nOr in the next big All-Star trade.\n\nThe Grizzlies must keep this in mind, as most title contenders posses two, sometimes three, elite perimeter players on their squads. They desperately need to find a wing or 2-guard that can take pressure off Ja Morant as a playmaker, hit 3\u2019s, defend good enough, and create his own offense.\n\nThe franchise has been longing for that type of player since Rudy Gay\u2019s departure, and finding a player of that skillset between Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. would bolster their probability of long-term success.\n\nExpand the Horizons of Your Best Players\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies have their trio, and the crazy thing is, they have room to grow. As it stands right now, with experience and time, the Grizzlies could become a playoff team \u2014 if these players stay the course. However, empowering them to add dimensions to their games and to take on different roles can launch both the team and the players to new heights.\n\nWith Ja Morant, there\u2019s already a lot to like. He\u2019s an elite playmaker with dazzling ball-handling, 3-level scoring potential, and jump-out-the-gym athleticism. Where his game could go another level comes with experience and empowerment. Over time, he\u2019ll learn the nuances of running a NBA offense and reading NBA defenses. Taylor Jenkins must continue empowering him to be that go-to scorer when needed, as well as keeping others involved in the offense. It won\u2019t be surprising to see him have at least one 20-10 season in this decade.\n\nJaren Jackson Jr. is already one of the NBA\u2019s most unique big men. He plays like a big guard with his three-point volume and efficiency, ball-handling, and rebounding. For Jackson to catapult himself into the \u201celite big man\u201d conversation and maximize his potential, it\u2019ll come down to fouling \u2014 obvious, but fixable \u2014 and rebounding. Jaren can become one of the league\u2019s best big men this decade, and for him to be one, the Grizzlies must continue to explore these unique aspects of his game, while working on his current flaws.\n\nBrandon Clarke is the x-factor here. He has the makings of a top-end role player; even if he\u2019s what he is now, he\u2019s an excellent 6th-7th man off the bench. Where Clarke can take the Grizzlies and his game to new heights comes as a playmaker. He\u2019s flashed the potential to be a good passer over the past few games, and he must continue honing his craft in that area. In addition, if he puts more work into his ball-handling, it opens up more transition opportunities, as well as more chances for him to create offense from the perimeter. If he starts averaging between 3-5 assists, and facilitates out of the short roll, he could easily become the Draymond Green of the 2020\u2019s \u2014 a versatile big man that can defend all 5 positions, space the floor, and serve as a secondary playmaker.\n\nThe Grizzlies\u2019 young trio is already good. If the coaching staff can expand the horizons off their game, and empower them to play a bit out of their comfort zone, you could easily see these three lead Memphis to long-term, sustainable success.\n\nContinue Accumulating Assets, but Know When to Cash In\n\nBeing completely honest, the post-LeBron West is open.\n\nThe Nuggets will be good with Nikola Jokic, and will be even better if Jamal Murray becomes a perennial All-Star, and Michael Porter Jr. becomes something.\n\nThe Pelicans and Thunder have a boatload of assets and some young talent, after their superstar trades.\n\nDallas has Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nYes, the next generation of the West will be challenging, but behind Morant, Jackson, and Clarke, the Grizzlies are in that race.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in their surprising playoff race right now, but let\u2019s not forget the long game here. Kleiman and company must continue accumulating assets in the form of draft capital and young players \u2014 whether that comes from deals involving Andre Iguodala, Solomon Hill, Jae Crowder, or even Jonas Valanciunas.\n\nHowever, when the time comes where they have a shot to win it all, they must cash in on the accumulated assets. We\u2019ve seen what happens when you cash in \u2014 the Toronto Raptors. And we\u2019ve seen when you fail to cash in \u2014 the Boston Celtics.\n\nIt could be something as small as adding that veteran starter, or two, on a bad team to bolster the bench. It could be another deal that Dallas and Atlanta did with Doncic and Trae Young \u2014 please, please, God, I want Jalen Green. Or it could be making a play for the next disgruntled All-Star and persuading him to stay with the attraction of being a title contender \u2014 Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Karl-Anthony Towns... all players that come to mind.\n\nThe Grizzlies already have two prized assets in the Utah Jazz pick from the Conley trade \u2014 based on early returns, that pick will be sweet \u2014 and the Warriors pick in the Iguodala salary dump \u2014 when Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green will be on the wrong side of 30.\n\nThe Grizzlies possess a forward-thinking front office that\u2019s in the game of asset accumulation. They can\u2019t be like Danny Ainge and hold them to their chest. They have to go in when they feel like they can bring a championship parade to Beale Street.\n\nI don\u2019t think many people realize how special the 2020\u2019s could be. Yes, the GNG days were amazing, and it\u2019s easy to want to compare these guys to that era.\n\nThis is entirely different though.\n\nThe pieces are there to build a legitimate title contender \u2014 not just a dark-horse favorite.\n\nThey have two of the best 5-6 guys from the past two drafts \u2014 one, a dynamic playmaker that drips with superstar potential; the other, a unicorn big man that\u2019s literally a dream of any modern NBA enthusiast.\n\nA third fiddle that could evolve into an elite role player that could become another Draymond Green, one of the most integral players of one of the best teams of all time.\n\nA coach that already has installed an offense that\u2019s already generating league-best assist rates and pace.\n\nThe assets to strike in franchise-altering move.\n\nAnd a front office that\u2019s preaching the long game and seeking sustainable success.\n\nThe recipe is just about there. If they can find Ja Morant\u2019s running mate, expand the horizons of their best players, and capitalize the \u201casset-catching\u201d game, the Memphis Grizzlies could deliver something this city deserves ...\n\nA championship parade on Beale Street.\n\nFollow Grizzly Bear Blues on Twitter and Instagram", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jan"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Memphis Grizzlies have a chance to build something special this decade.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/blog/favicon/235/favicon-d1f32573.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Grizzly Bear Blues", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Straight-Outta-Vancouver/206064986074515", "published_time": "2020-01-01T07:55:35-06:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T07:55:35-06:00"}, "author": "pfleming15", "style-tools": "https://www.sbnation.com/style/community/235/adbbe0e9a648bb3ce39406aba0a77eea/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "description": "The Memphis Grizzlies have a chance to build something special this decade.", "og": {"description": "The Memphis Grizzlies have a chance to build something special this decade.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1CQGnxxokhJ9qq2xJxV3yQ1eknE=/0x452:6275x3737/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19526735/1191085933.jpg.jpg", "alt": "Utah Jazz v Memphis Grizzlies", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Grizzly Bear Blues", "title": "The Memphis Grizzlies and a successful  2020s", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.grizzlybearblues.com/2020/1/1/21042067/the-memphis-grizzlies-and-a-successful-2020s-ja-morant-jaren-jackson-jr-brandon-clarke-nba"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.grizzlybearblues.com/2020/1/1/21042067/the-memphis-grizzlies-and-a-successful-2020s-ja-morant-jaren-jackson-jr-brandon-clarke-nba", "title": "The Memphis Grizzlies and a successful  2020s", "description": "The Memphis Grizzlies have a chance to build something special this decade.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X2vRFcDg8flq7V3Cdfro-OTDTxs=/0x525:6275x3663/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19526735/1191085933.jpg.jpg", "alt": "Utah Jazz v Memphis Grizzlies"}, "site": "sbnGrizzlies"}, "sailthru.title": "The Memphis Grizzlies and a successful  2020s", "sailthru.tags": "nba,basketball,memphis-grizzlies,grizzly-bear-blues,front-page,features", "sailthru.description": "The Memphis Grizzlies have a chance to build something special this decade.", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-01T07:55:35-06:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OVECjUyRyxENHfcgBqQI6p726Ns=/0x329:6275x3859/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66004430/1191085933.jpg.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5iucmac9aw8m9WgUKIV0tby2rJM=/1044x0:5232x4188/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66004430/1191085933.jpg.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/blog/sbnu_logo_minimal/235/touch_icon_ipad_retina_grizzlybearblues.com.minimal.7521.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#728dad", "outbrainsection": "features"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.grizzlybearblues.com/2020/1/1/21042067/the-memphis-grizzlies-and-a-successful-2020s-ja-morant-jaren-jackson-jr-brandon-clarke-nba"}
