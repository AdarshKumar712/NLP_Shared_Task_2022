TMZ has learned.\n\n20-year-old Charlie Noxon had an accident on the slopes of Park City, Utah on New Year's Eve. Law enforcement says he fell, and it was apparent he needed immediate medical attention. A helicopter from the University of Utah's Medivac Unit was dispatched and took Charlie to a nearby hospital. He was later pronounced dead.\n\nAside from saying Noxon fell, there were no other details available concerning the circumstances surrounding the accident.\n\nCharlie appeared in an episode of \"Weeds\" back in 2008. His mom, Jenji Kohan, and his dad, journalist Christopher Noxon, divorced in 2018 after 21 years of marriage.\n\nCharlie was in Park City with his dad and 2 siblings when the accident occurred.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The 20-year-old son of the creator of \"Weeds\" has died on a family skiing trip.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "google-site-verification": "UUmtbUBf3djgPpCeLefe_PbFsOc6JGxfXmHzpjFLAEQ", "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "p": {"domain_verify": "933e74ace98032aadbc3328616280038"}, "robots": "index,follow", "description": "The 20-year-old son of the creator of \"Weeds\" has died on a family skiing trip.", "fb": {"app_id": 310610065699820}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tmz"}, "og": {"site_name": "TMZ", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/01/weeds-creator-jenji-kohan-son-dead-dies-park-city-utah-ski/", "title": "'Weeds' Creator Jenji Kohan's Son Dies on Family Skiing Trip", "description": "The 20-year-old son of the creator of \"Weeds\" has died on a family skiing trip.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/58/16by9/2020/01/01/5882b79c45f24441b1767775ac944485_xl.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TMZ", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Weeds' Creator Jenji Kohan's Son Dies on Family Skiing Trip", "description": "The 20-year-old son of the creator of \"Weeds\" has died on a family skiing trip.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/58/16by9/2020/01/01/5882b79c45f24441b1767775ac944485_xl.jpg"}, "application-name": "TMZ.COM", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#000000", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.rhythmnewmedia.tmz&referrer=utm_source%3Dsmartbanner%26utm_medium%3Dnative%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartbanner%26anid%3Dadmob", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=299948601, affiliate-data=ct=Smart_Banner&pt=201436, app-argument=https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/01/weeds-creator-jenji-kohan-son-dead-dies-park-city-utah-ski/?tmz#article", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TMZ.COM", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/msapplication-tile-image-270x270-v1.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.tmz.com/?adid=IE9pin", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#000000", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "TMZ | Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Photos;action-uri=https://www.tmz.com/photos/;icon-uri=https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/01/weeds-creator-jenji-kohan-son-dead-dies-park-city-utah-ski/"}
