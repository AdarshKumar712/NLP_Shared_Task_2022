While there are challenges and there is always the unknown, most indicators point to continued steady economic conditions in our key source markets and robust visitor expenditures,\u201d she said in an end of year message.\n\nAffonso-Dass said that Caribbean hoteliers have much to be proud of in 2019 after taking up the challenges of the past 12 months \u201cand successfully folded them into an optimistic canvas for the New Year\u201d.\n\nShe said that the destinations hardest hit by the 2017 hurricanes have made impressive progress to pre-hurricane levels and are back on track with new and improved product.\n\n'Their fortitude has encouraged many of our members who were spared the wrath of the storms to reassess their product, spurring many of them to greater heights. The silver lining on the dark clouds of hurricane devastation was the fact we were not only able to rebuild but we also were able to bolster our structures to withstand the wrath of future storms.\u201d\n\nThe CHTA official said that arrivals throughout the region, in fact, are very high and on pace for a record year in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of destinations recorded marked increases and the Caribbean is on pace to reach its highest annual RevPAR in history by year-end,\u201d she said, noting that \u201cwhile external factors like the global economy are key to our success, it would not be possible without the aggressive efforts by the region's public and private sectors over the past decade to expand and modernize airports and attract significant hotel investments \u2013 both in new and refurbished properties.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see arrivals growth fuelled by accommodation disruptors in the form of vacation home rentals; this will continue to be an important part of the accommodations sector \u2013 it is ever more important therefore to ensure that it is better regulated, taxed and integrated into the collaborative efforts of all tourism industry stakeholders.\u201d\n\nIn her message, Affonso-Dass singled out the Bahamas, still recovering from the passage of Hurricane Dorian on September 1 that killed nearly 70 people and left damage estimated at US$3.4 billion.\n\n\u201cOur sincere thanks also goes out to all those who supported our efforts to ease the suffering of the islanders by giving generously to our recovery fundraising initiatives.\n\n\u201cThrough one of our support initiatives, the Caribbean Tourism Job Bank, we were pleased to see the number of organisations from areas unaffected by the storm, offering jobs to some 2,500 Bahamian hotel workers who were displaced by Dorian. We are working collaboratively with our partners in The Bahamas to support their recovery with the funds which were raised.\u201d\n\nShe said she was also pleased that the CHTA Education Foundation has been organising and offering scholarships and special assistance for the education and training of Caribbean tourism industry personnel and students pursuing tourism and hospitality careers.\n\n\u201cOver the past year the foundation and its partners have made special efforts for students from hurricane-afflicted islands as well as focused on the critically important issue of diversity to better equip our team members to warmly welcome, respect and embrace the world.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to being leaders in this space and are happy that our efforts have begun to open doors for discussions on issues that urgently need to be addressed so that all people living in and visiting our beautiful region \u2013 irrespective of gender, sexual or religious preference \u2013 feel safe, welcomed and truly part of our Caribbean community.\u201d\n\nShe urged participation at the January 21-23 Caribbean Travel Marketplace to be held in the Bahamas as well as the Caribbean Hospitality Industry Exchange Forum (CHIEF) and Taste of the Caribbean to be held in Miami in June.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Latest NewsToday's Headlines"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jamaica Observer Limited"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (CMC) \u2013 The President of the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association (...", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"alexaVerifyID": "rSmiGOPEjbvIe54g6VDdjp7fxDQ", "google-site-verification": "yGWL0JARPWTYZuQO6SyybESnW5Tn5sn_mj5vRQhwZq8", "y_key": "b1206159d404874b", "msvalidate.01": "F356DE1E2BCA8CFA747B5120592BE455", "description": "BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (CMC) \u2013 The President of the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association (...", "keywords": "Latest NewsToday's Headlines", "og": {"title": "Caribbean hoteliers predict 'exciting and fruitful' 2020", "site_name": "Jamaica Observer", "image": "http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/JO/20200101/ARTICLE/200109993/AR/0/AR-200109993.jpg"}, "revisit-after": "1 days", "Author": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "DC.Subject": "Jamaica, Observer", "DC.Title": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "ROBOTS": "Follow,Index", "rating": "GENERAL", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@JamaicaObserver", "creator": "@JamaicaObserver", "title": "Caribbean hoteliers predict 'exciting and fruitful' 2020", "description": "BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (CMC) \u2013 The President of the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association (...", "image": "http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/JO/20200101/ARTICLE/200109993/AR/0/AR-200109993.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": ""}
