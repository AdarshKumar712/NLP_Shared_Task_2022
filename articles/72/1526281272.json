The Eagles managed to keep the Tar Heels at bay until the bottom of the third inning, when head coach Donna Papa\u2019s team was finally able to sneak runners on base.\n\nFirst-year outfielder Bri Stubbs completed a surprise bunt, helping her get all the way to second base and drive in the game\u2019s first run after N.C. Central threw an errant ball over first base.\n\nOnce the Tar Heels developed an appetite for scoring, the inning went south for the Eagles. A passed ball brought Stubbs in for the second score of the game, only to be one-upped by junior Zo\u00eb Goodman, who powered a two-run home run that to center field to cap off an explosive four-run inning for UNC.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "\u201cMy two words for today were attack and adjust,\u201d Papa said. \u201cI was pleased that we made adjustments and played solid all the way around.\u201d", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://d39xfl750sfsi8.cloudfront.net/96c3e7162d60df704c94be325f3f1be4/dist/img/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "\u201cMy two words for today were attack and adjust,\u201d Papa said. \u201cI was pleased that we made adjustments and played solid all the way around.\u201d", "fb": {"app_id": 386215825139752}, "twitter": {"site": "@dailytarheel", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"url": "https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2020/02/unc-softball-nc-central-game-recap", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Daily Tar Heel", "title": "UNC softball rebounds with 7-0 shutout win against North Carolina Central", "description": "\u201cMy two words for today were attack and adjust,\u201d Papa said. \u201cI was pleased that we made adjustments and played solid all the way around.\u201d", "image": {"identifier": "https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dth/6990eb70-8c71-4c07-9981-a593404527cf.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&h=600", "width": 800, "height": 600}}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "google-site-verification": "CHlXbXA4sWralvQUEv7pJfpAAlXw8V34QT7XXWre_aU"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2020/02/unc-softball-nc-central-game-recap"}
