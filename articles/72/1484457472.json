They seem to wear their MAGA hats as much to provoke as to proclaim.\n\nAnger is in no short supply in America, there's plenty to go around. Those of us not hardwired into Fox, though, are looking for solutions, not scapegoats.\n\nFox viewers have a remarkable ability to remain laser focused on simple messages and a short list of who's to blame for their problems.\n\nIn 2016 it was \"Lock her up.\" In 2019 it's \"Send her back.\"\n\nFox viewers have been brainwashed into believing that Democrats are not just political opponents, but an ENEMY determined to destroy America. Ironic that it's Trump and the GOP obliterating the Constitution and the rule of law.\n\nIn 1949 the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) introduced the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to present both sides of issues that were controversial and in the public square.\n\nSounds reasonable, no?\n\nIn 1987, just one year after Australian born media mogul, Rupert Murdoch founded Fox Broadcasting Company, the FCC abolished the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nCoincidence? Maybe. If you believe in them.\n\nIn 1996, Murdoch created Fox News and hired Republican strategist Roger Ailes to craft a Conservative message machine.\n\nTheir goal was and remains to stir up anger and resentment without provoking thought.\n\nIf you are a Trump supporter and feel that you've been maligned by my description of you as under informed and over opinionated, don't feel bad. Your leader suffers that same affliction, only worse.\n\nDonald Trump has been a savvy manipulator of the press for decades. He has gone so far as to call newspapers and pretend to be someone else, just to promote this \"other guy,\" Donald Trump.\n\nFox and Republican operatives are almost prescient in their ability to identify potential threats to their plans of being the ruling minority.\n\nThe Democratic minority in the Senate actually represents about 40 million more Americans than Moscow Mitch's Republican majority.\n\nSo much for rule of the people.\n\nRepublicans painted a bulls eye on Hillary Clinton's back while she was still the first lady of Arkansas. Millions of Americans hate Clinton because they've been programmed that way.\n\nThey don't know why, they just know they should. I covered a bit of that in, OK, dickhead, what ABOUT Benghazi?\n\nLyle McLovin of Glencoe, IL told me that he hated Hillary because she lied. He doesn't know what she lied about or how he came to that conclusion. In his mind it was just \"a fact.\"\n\nWhen challenged on his \"facts,\" Lyle just yells, in increasing volume, It's a fact, it's a fact. That means he heard if from Sean Hannity.\n\nTrump put the icing on the cake that Fox put into the oven two decades ago. Like they're raising mushrooms, Fox keeps its viewers in the dark and feeds them shit.\n\nTrump insists that anything that throws shade on him is \"fake news.\" Now everything's fake news.\n\nWhen Trump's Attorney General, William Barr issued a 3-1/2 page statement completely misrepresenting and misstating the results of the Mueller investigation, it was already a moot point.\n\nThe Trumpsters weren't going to believe anyone who said anything other than, No collusion.\n\nIt's long been said that truth is the first casualty of war and make no mistake, America is at war. Sadly, it is an internal conflict, much like the Civil War, but the stakes could not be higher.\n\nNot only is democracy struggling to survive, but the future of a melting planet also hangs in the balance.\n\nWe need to educate a not-so-small portion of the electorate that rejects fact, science and education, itself.\n\nTalk about mission impossible.\n\nSubscribe to the Chicago Board of Tirade\n\n* You will never get SPAM\n\n* Your email address will never be sold or given away\n\n* You will only receive emails on days I post.\n\n* You can unsubscribe at any time\n\n* You can contact me anytime at: RJ@bobabrams.net\n\n* Just type your email address in the box and click the \"create subscription\" button.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["MAGA", "Benghazi", "Sean Hannity"], "authors": ["Bob Abrams"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-board-tirade/wp-content/themes/chicagonow/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.6.1", "og": {"title": "Fox \"News\" incites without insight, leaving viewers under informed and over opinionated", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-board-tirade/2020/01/fox-under-informed/", "image": "http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-board-tirade/files/2019/11/Fox-Fool-Aid.png", "description": "Originally posted on September 9, 2019 Fox viewers are an angry bunch.\u00a0 They seem to wear their MAGA hats as much to provoke as to proclaim.
