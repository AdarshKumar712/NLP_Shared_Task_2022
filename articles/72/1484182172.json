The distance to the Sun will be 147 million kilometres.\n\nFirst Quarter is on the 3rd and Full Moon follows on January 11. Last Quarter occurs on January 18 with New Moon falling on January 25.\n\nThe Centaurids meteor shower peaks on the January 8 but moonlight will interfere with viewing.\n\nPlanets:\n\nMercury passes into the evening sky after the 11th but lies too close to the Sun to be seen.\n\nVenus is a brilliant object in the western sky, setting around 11pm.\n\nMars rises around 2.30am, mid month. It will appear close to the red star Antares on the 19th and 20th. Antares will appear the brighter of the two. The crescent Moon is within three degrees of Mars on the 21st.\n\nJupiter should be visible against the glow of the dawn twilight sky from mid January. Look south of east, a short distance above the horizon, for a bright star. The Moon is close to Jupiter on the 23rd and 24th.\n\nSaturn is at conjunction with the Sun on the 14th and will unobservable this month.\n\nStars and Constellations:\n\nOrion continues to dominate the summer evening sky. Slightly to the east, the brightest star in the heavens, Sirius, is readily seen Crux, the Southern Cross, is very low in the southern sky.\n\nAlmost overhead is the star Achernar, main star in the long straggling constellation of Eridanus. Nearby, at a similar altitude, is Canopus, second only to Sirius in brilliance.\n\nTowards the northern horizon is the constellation of Auriga, the Charioteer. Above it can be found Pleiades and Taurus, while further east is Gemini.\n\n- Prepared for the Taranaki Daily News by Tom Whelan, Cape Egmont Observatory.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Tom Whelan"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "In January, the Earth is at perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun for the year, on January 5th.
