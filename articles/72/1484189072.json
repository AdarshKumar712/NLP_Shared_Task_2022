Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not extend the term of Danny Danon, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nDanon\u2019s term officially expired on Tuesday, the same day that the announcement that his term would not be extended was made, Israel\u2019s Channel 12 first reported.\n\nDanon\u2019s term was supposed to end in August, but Netanyahu extended it to the end of 2019.\n\nNetanyahu did not name a permanent replacement for Danon, and because he is heading a transitional government likely will not be able to make such a senior appointment.\n\nThe deputy representative to the U.N., Noa Furman, will lead the diplomatic mission in the meantime.\n\nNetanyahu this week asked Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit if he can make a permanent appointment while heading an interim government but has not yet received an answer.\n\nDanon in 2017 was elected as vice president of the General Assembly as the representative of the Western states. His tenure has been notable for a strong push against the U.N.\u2019s historically poor treatment of Israel\n\nThere currently are no Israeli ambassadors to Russia, Canada and Egypt, The Jerusalem Post reported.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["David Suissa", "Dan Schnur", "Eva Robbins", "Rachel Fish", "Lorelei Laird", "Debra Nussbaum Cohen", "Daniel Greenfield", "Natalie Solomon", "Shmuel Rosner", "Sharla Etkin-Ives"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 21:21:15 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "JERUSALEM (JTA) \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not extend the term of Danny Danon, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations.
