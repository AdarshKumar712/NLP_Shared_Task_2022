Though many private organizations and various levels of government are involved in the search for solutions, the series looks specifically at the problem in local cities, what they are doing about it and what more might be done. In this article, we examine what experts, advocates and city leaders say needs to be done to address homelessness.\n\nLaguna Beach opened its homeless shelter in 2009. Costa Mesa opened one in 2019. Huntington Beach plans to follow suit, but its ribbon-cutting has been stymied by legal action and other problems with site selection . Newport Beach has started serious discussions of developing its own but also is encountering obstacles.\n\nWhen it comes to homeless services, Orange County cities have largely gone their separate ways over the years.\n\nThe result is a system that, in places, more closely resembles a patchwork quilt than a tightly woven mesh \u2014 one in which some cities harbor relatively robust services and resources for the homeless and others have few.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough myriad factors have contributed to and continue to fuel homelessness in Orange County, the apparent disconnect among some city leaders \u2014 as well as their colleagues at the state and county levels \u2014 has historically presented one of the most significant hurdles, according to an Orange County grand jury report in May 2018.\n\nAs the report put it, \u201cA city trying to go it alone ignores the regional nature of homelessness.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a \u201cfinger-pointing and lack of trust that exists between the county and the cities, and even among the cities themselves, on the homeless issue,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThe cities believe the county is not providing sufficient leadership in outlining a countywide plan for the homeless and is too frugal in disbursing the state and federal homeless funds it receives. Meanwhile, the county is frustrated that cities are not responsive to repeated requests for siting any type of homeless housing, be it emergency shelters or permanent housing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe separation on the issue makes some sense when considering that the cities themselves are separate. They have their own elected officials and professional staff members, all with their own perspectives and priorities.\n\nEach city also has its own budget. Considering all the other services that residents rely on, those pools of money can drain in a hurry, making the idea of committing significant long-term dollars to homelessness-related efforts unpalatable, if not infeasible in some cases.\n\n\u201cTwo large obstacles are, one, the lack of centralized coordination of the effort and, two, sufficient funding to add shelters and services,\u201d said Steve Nagel, a Fountain Valley City Council member and former mayor. \u201cCities have limited funding streams that have historically been dedicated to providing police, fire, public works, recreation and planning responsibilities.\n\n\u201cCities are struggling to ensure they have enough funding and staffing expertise to just handle their mandated responsibilities and will be unable to fund homelessness solutions for the long term.\u201d\n\nDawn Price, executive director of Friendship Shelter, which operates the Laguna Beach shelter on Laguna Canyon Road, agreed that \u201cthere\u2019s no single entity that [is] sort of acknowledged as the one that\u2019s going to take the reins and the leadership in a regional problem like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn L.A. [County], it\u2019s going to be [the] Los Angeles mayor and City Council. \u2026 O.C. is sitting here with a fairly large population and no central city,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique set of sort of governmental circumstances or jurisdictional circumstances that ... makes it hard for people to accept responsibility or say \u2018I\u2019ll do my part.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut as homelessness has exploded into arguably Orange County\u2019s most pressing problem, many local leaders seemingly are on the same page in acknowledging the regional nature of the issue and the need for cooperation among the county, state and cities.\n\nHowever, leaders in every city are accountable to their constituents. Any suggested solutions will need some community buy-in, and an elected official\u2019s political fortunes could hinge on one controversial vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when it comes to homelessness, controversy is rarely in short supply.\n\nResistance\n\nResidents picket and chant outside Newport Beach City Hall to voice their disapproval of a proposed homeless shelter before a City Council meeting in October. (File Photo)\n\nPublic sentiment has always played a key role in shaping cities\u2019 responses to the homeless, according to advocates and service providers.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018NIMBYs\u2019 want everybody to just leave out of their neighborhoods, but they have to go somewhere,\u201d said Bill Nelson, executive director of Fresh Beginnings Ministries, a Costa Mesa-based nonprofit that aids those who are homeless or close to it. \u201cSomebody needs to ask at one point, \u2018Whose backyard is it going to be? Where are we going to put them?\u2019\u201d\n\nNIMBY, an acronym for \u201cNot in my backyard,\u201d is a term often used by critics of people who object to proposals in their neighborhoods or cities.\n\nAs cities across the county weigh whether to open new homeless shelters, some residents have ramped up their efforts to keep such facilities out of their proverbial backyards.\n\nThough the proposals have been different, the citizenry\u2019s concerns have been fairly consistent from one city to another. Residents worry that shelters will attract homeless people from all over who will loiter, litter, drink, use drugs, commit crimes and generally create a nuisance wherever they congregate.\n\nThe result, some residents argue, will be neighborhoods that are less safe, homes that are worth less and an overall quality of life that is in decline.\n\nMeetings to discuss potential homeless shelters have at times morphed into heated affairs marked by shouts, jeers and other outbursts. In Costa Mesa, hundreds of people turned out in March 2018 to fight a proposal to use the soon-to-close Fairview Developmental Center as an emergency shelter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Huntington Beach City Council\u2019s move in April to buy a building to use as a shelter came amid fierce opposition from residents who felt the site-selection process had been opaque and needlessly rushed.\n\nThat proposal was later dropped after a group of Huntington residents, other property owners and businesses filed a lawsuit claiming the site can be used only for industrial purposes. The city is now exploring other potential locations.\n\n\"\u201cThe \u2018NIMBYs\u2019 want everybody to just leave out of their neighborhoods, but they have to go somewhere. Somebody needs to ask at one point, \u2018Whose backyard is it going to be? Where are we going to put them?\u2019\u201d Bill Nelson, executive director of Fresh Beginnings Ministries\n\nA regular refrain from residents, regardless of the city they call home, is that they\u2019re not against helping the homeless, they just object to specific concepts they believe don\u2019t make sense for their communities.\n\nSome Newport Beach residents, for instance, have railed against sites the city has suggested for a homeless shelter, including the city public works yard at 592 Superior Ave.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like telling me I have to put my head on a swivel if I want to walk outside in my own neighborhood [especially in the evening],\u201d Ryan Janis, a nearby homeowner, wrote in a message to the city in September. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to look 360 degrees every time I go for a walk or take my dog for a stroll in my own neighborhood. If this is added on Superior, it will increase the flow of transient \u2018monsters\u2019 in my neighborhood, which is not a place anyone will ever want to raise a family or buy property.\u201d\n\nMany Newport Beach residents have fiercely resisted a proposal to convert a portion of the city\u2019s public works yard at 592 Superior Ave. into a 40-bed homeless shelter. Doing so, they argued, would turn the area into a skid row. (File Photo)\n\nOthers question the role their cities should play in housing the homeless. Some of the people on the streets may not have local ties, they say, and offering additional services or accommodations may fulfill the prophecy of \u201cIf you build it, they will come.\u201d\n\nDuring a City Council meeting in April, Huntington Beach resident Doug Hein claimed that a proliferation of sober-living homes and other addiction-treatment facilities has lured many people to Orange County, where they eventually become homeless.\n\n\u201cWe have patients from the entire 50 states ending up here,\u201d he said. \u201cOur weather attracts people from many other states. So, I seriously doubt that the majority of people living on our streets are Huntington Beach residents. They\u2019re people from other states and so, to me, it\u2019s unfair that we have to bear ... the financial burden and the burdens of housing this.\u201d\n\nSome residents have said it would make more sense and cost less money to move the homeless to inland areas for shelter and/or treatment.\n\nOthers have asserted that, in some cases, being homeless is a choice potentially borne of a desire to live outside certain societal norms or to experience coastal living without the commensurate cost.\n\n\u201cI am all for helping people that want to help themselves, but a lot of the homeless, if you go out there and talk to them, they don\u2019t ... They\u2019re happy,\u201d Huntington Beach resident Katrina Tengan said in April. \u201cThey\u2019ve got things pretty good. Do you know how much money they can make by just begging on the street? I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s more money than I can make. And yet we\u2019re enabling this.\u201d\n\nEven in Laguna Beach, which was well ahead of its neighbors in opening a shelter \u2014 called the Alternative Sleeping Location \u2014 some have expressed concerns with how much the city is doing.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re sheltering more people than we should be sheltering, and I would like to see those numbers reduced,\u201d Councilman Peter Blake said.\n\nSome of the homeless are aware of how they\u2019re perceived.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost to a point where people are giving you resources, but they almost think they\u2019re enabling you,\u201d said Josh Webster, 42, who lives in Laguna Beach. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s like you need those resources just to survive.\u201d\n\nAdvocates and service providers largely dismiss the claims that many of the county\u2019s homeless are from out of state or have chosen their lot in life. Combating those beliefs, they say, is a vital part of turning around residents\u2019 attitudes about developing resources for the homeless, particularly shelters.\n\n\u201cThere is this idea that people come to California to become homeless, but the data doesn\u2019t show that,\u201d said Becks Heyhoe, director of United to End Homelessness for Orange County United Way.\n\nShe pointed to a June 2017 study commissioned by the United Way, UC Irvine and Jamboree Housing Corp. that determined \u201cthe vast majority of Orange County\u2019s homeless, whether male or female, are U.S. citizens and long-term Orange County residents.\u201d\n\nBecks Heyhoe, director of United to End Homelessness for Orange County United Way, conducts one of her periodic Homelessness 101 classes at the United Way office in Irvine. (Don Leach / Staff Photographer)\n\nHeyhoe said some of the popular \u201cmyths\u201d may have taken root because, for some, it\u2019s more comfortable to view homeless people as separate or different.\n\n\u201cWhen we do that, we are able to distance ourselves from them, because if we turn somebody into the \u2018other,\u2019 especially ... when we kind of assign blame to them \u2014 that it\u2019s their fault that they are this way \u2014 it\u2019s very easy for them to remain the \u2018other,\u2019 and then we don\u2019t need to engage,\u201d she said.\n\nAll of that makes the role of local leaders even more vital, advocates say.\n\nWhen it comes to the homeless, \u201cthe political will of city councils can change outcomes,\u201d said Helen Cameron, community outreach director for Jamboree Housing, an Irvine-based developer of affordable and supportive housing.\n\n\u201cI think city councils need to show their bravery and realize that they can make a decision that can end homelessness,\u201d she said.\n\nSome former and current elected officials, though, say showing the courage that Cameron speaks of can carry a cost beyond losing some votes at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cThirty-plus years ago, somebody thought that homeless needed to eat and we got a soup kitchen,\u201d then-Costa Mesa Councilman Jim Righeimer said in March 2018. \u201cYou know what we got? More homeless. You bring services in, you get more.\u201d\n\nBlake pointed out that although Laguna Beach was well ahead of the pack in opening a shelter in coastal Orange County, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in 2015 accusing the city of trying to push out homeless people with disabilities by not providing adequate accommodations for them.\n\nThe city and ACLU settled that case in 2018.\n\n\u201cAll the example that we set was, \u2018Don\u2019t be stupid like Laguna Beach and create a shelter and then destroy your downtown, destroy Main Beach and then find yourselves being sued to the tune of millions of dollars \u2026 because of all you\u2019ve done,\u2019\u201d Blake said.\n\nPractical concerns\n\nWhile public pressure presents a significant potential pitfall, other obstacles also stand in the way of addressing homelessness, according to advocates and experts.\n\nEconomic realities, namely the high price of housing throughout the county and state, present a significant hurdle.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s severe affordable-housing crisis puts Californians at risk of housing instability and homelessness,\u201d according to a report last year from the California legislative analyst\u2019s office. \u201cFor the state\u2019s lowest\u2011income households, job loss or an unexpected expense could result in homelessness.\u201d\n\nMany of those surveyed in the 2017 United Way/UCI/Jamboree study said economic issues were major factors that led to their homelessness \u2014 40% cited \u201csecuring or retaining jobs with sustainable wages\u201d and 36% pointed to \u201cfinding or retaining affordable housing, including evictions and foreclosures.\u201d\n\n(Greg Diaz / Daily Pilot)\n\nHuntington Beach City Councilwoman Barbara Delgleize, a real estate broker, said \u201ccertainly the high cost of housing\u201d is an obstacle to comprehensively addressing homelessness.\n\n\u201cIn our community, that\u2019s as much based on our location as it is construction and development costs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also don\u2019t have enough units at various income levels across the region \u2026 nor do we have enough shelter beds or crisis stabilization unit beds or supportive housing units. The entire continuum needs expansion.\u201d\n\nAdvocates have cited a dire need for supportive housing, which pairs residential units with services aimed at helping those who have been living on the street access the resources they need and adjust to having a roof over their heads again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just as hard keeping them housed as it is getting them housed,\u201d said John Begin, homelessness initiative director for Trellis, a Costa Mesa faith-based consortium that seeks to address significant local issues. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people living in cardboard in their new apartment because they were so used to sleeping in a cardboard box outside that they were just uncomfortable. It took them days to get out of the cardboard box and into the bed.\u201d\n\nA homeless man sleeps on the curb at Mountain Road and South Coast Highway in Laguna Beach.\n\n(File Photo)\n\nParticularly exciting for advocates is the recent creation of the Orange County Housing Finance Trust, a joint county-cities authority formed to secure and allocate funding for affordable and supportive housing projects.\n\nSuch mechanisms are key in realizing the ultimate solution to homelessness, which is getting more people housed. Doing so also will alleviate some of the effects homelessness can have on businesses and neighborhoods, according to advocates and experts.\n\n\u201cYou have the fears of sexual abuse and substance abuse and ... other forms of criminality, but the other things \u2014 well, they ... relieve themselves in public. They loiter. They carry around a lot of junk. They\u2019re unsightly. They stink,\u201d said David Snow, a UC Irvine sociology professor who has extensively researched homelessness and co-conducted the 2017 joint study. \u201cAll of those things disappear when people have housing.\u201d\n\nThough much of the public discussion in recent months has focused on opening emergency shelters, experts and advocates say local governments also need to plan for what\u2019s next.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one that thinks we need a lot more shelter beds,\u201d said Price of Friendship Shelter. \u201cI think we need a lot more exits from shelters so the shelter beds can turn over.\u201d\n\nPrice said part of that is getting cities on board with the idea of developing more housing accessible to those on the lower economic end.\n\n\u201cI would like to see more cities really championing housing developments in their communities, affordable for working-class poor as well as affordable for people who are homeless,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one that thinks we need a lot more shelter beds. I think we need a lot more exits from shelters so the shelter beds can turn over.\u201d Dawn Price, executive director of Friendship Shelter\n\nAnother important thing, advocates say, is the mind-set cities have when looking at homelessness. Is their goal to address its symptoms or to tackle the root causes?\n\nJulia Devanthery, an attorney with the ACLU of Southern California, said the traditional response to homelessness in Orange County, \u201cas a policy matter, has been criminalization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe theory is, if you make it illegal to be homeless and you sort of ticket people and throw them in jail for failure to pay tickets that they can\u2019t afford ... first of all, you get people out of sight because they\u2019re mostly cycling in and out of jail,\u201d she said. \u201cSecond of all \u2026 it disincentivizes being homeless in that community because you\u2019re subjected to persecution for it.\u201d\n\nOther ideas\n\nSome elected officials say the rise in homelessness has been at least partly fueled by state-level criminal-justice reforms aimed at reducing the number of inmates in California\u2019s prison system. Critics say those efforts ended up making it easier to commit crimes.\n\n\u201cWe need to reverse recent legislation that has led to early release of prisoners, decriminalization of drug use and increased thresholds for felony grand theft,\u201d said Huntington Beach Councilman Patrick Brenden. \u201cWe need the courts to respect the authority of cities to enforce laws related to loitering, camping and panhandling.\u201d\n\nMoney also plays a major role, with some local leaders saying the state and county need to not only make additional dollars available for cities but also beef up spending for things such as mental health and drug and alcohol addiction treatment.\n\nWhile much remains to be done, some local leaders have expressed optimism that their cities \u2014 and the county as a whole \u2014 are well on their way.\n\n\u201cLocal governments have already developed partnerships in Orange County to reduce homelessness, and more partnerships are being discussed on a regular basis,\u201d said Huntington Beach Councilwoman Kim Carr. \u201cIf there is the political will, the financial incentive and the compassion among our residents and community leaders to solve the problem, it can be done. I don\u2019t think there will ever be an end to homelessness in America, but I feel Orange County is on the right track and, in time, we will be the model for the rest of the nation.\u201d\n\nTrust is vital\n\nTony Yim, a homeless liaison officer with the Newport Beach Police Department, tries to help Toni Horn get the television working at her new apartment in 2016. Horn spent years on the streets in Newport Beach before getting the Lake Forest apartment with help from Yim. (File Photo)\n\nAside from finances and logistics, cities, advocates and service providers face another challenge in addressing homelessness: getting those who need help to accept it.\n\nConnecting people to services isn\u2019t as simple as handing them a contact card or shuttling them to a resource center. Officials and advocates say their most important work may be building relationships with those they come across.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, whether someone is addicted, mentally ill, down on their luck, have physical problems or whatever the case is, they won\u2019t take their next step without trust, and they\u2019ve got to trust whoever is working with them,\u201d said Ian Stevenson, executive director of Trellis.\n\nIt may take time before people are willing to accept the help they\u2019re offered. That might not make sense from the outside, but advocates say the homeless \u2014 who can face terrible conditions and treatment on the streets \u2014 have fair reason to be skeptical.\n\n\u201cIn the realm of homelessness, you have everything from families who just lost their jobs, cars, houses, living on the streets,\u201d said Nelson of Fresh Beginnings Ministries. \u201cYou have veterans who saw such atrocious things that they didn\u2019t know how to even ask for [the] help that you need to get them. Then you have the criminal element who ... prey on the homeless. ...\n\n\u201cAnd then you have those who are just trying to hide in the shadows because they have nowhere else to go. In all of those things, it\u2019s going to take somebody to walk into the shadows to say, \u2018Tell me how I can help.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe \u2018fair share\u2019\n\nHowever, of all the challenges local governments face when trying to tackle homelessness, perhaps the most significant can be summed up by this finding from the 2018 grand jury report: \u201cThe cities are mistrustful of each other since each may think they already are providing more homeless services than other cities in their area.\u201d\n\nThat raises the question: What responsibility do individual cities have when it comes to providing such resources and services?\n\nShould each city have its own shelter? What about a set amount of supportive or low-income housing? If so, what should those thresholds look like and who should set them?\n\nIn other words, what is a city\u2019s \u201cfair share\u201d?\n\nComing in Part 4: The \u201cfair share\u201d argument and its effects.\n\nDaily Pilot staff writers Lilly Nguyen and Julia Sclafani contributed to this report.
