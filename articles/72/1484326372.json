Every first of January, people set New Year\u2019s Resolutions in the hopes of improving themselves or their lives; but how best to make them stick?\n\nThe following are a few tips to help with keeping what we resolve to do-or not do in the new year, according to experts:\n\n1. Set intentions. An intention is a guiding principle for how you want to be, live, show up in the world and is the starting point to every goal.\n\n2. Ask yourself why the intention or goal you set matters to you-and if it is realistic. Expectations that are too high can cause you to be too overwhelmed to start or maintain your goals.\n\n3. Talk to people about your resolutions. This creates a support system as well as can hold you accountable.\n\n4. Make a list of plans. Big goals can seem daunting, break your plan up into little things you can do each day to help achieve your ultimate goal.\n\n5. Take the first step. Don\u2019t procrastinate. You don\u2019t need to wait until everything is just right. Get started now and make adjustments as you go along.\n\n6. Ditch deprivation. Try not to approach your New Year\u2019s resolutions from a place of deprivation, restriction or punishment.\n\n7. Try not to focus on the end result. When you commit to the process of the goal, rather than the result, it\u2019s easier to make it an enjoyable experience.\n\n8. Take breaks. A goal should not consume your every thought and life, after all, is meant to be lived.\n\n9. Plan for success. Instead of thinking about failing and what could go wrong, think of succeeding; put those positive thoughts out to the world. Worrying about failure is pointless and destructive.\n\n10. Reward yourself. Celebrate your achievements, no matter how small; you deserve it!", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["westcentral", "rosetown", "kindersley", "online", "resources", "news", "saskatchewan", "town", "city", "news", "weather", "classifieds", "business", "jobs", "events", "calendar", "agriculture", "sports"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Angela Wingert"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 08:00:48 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "WestCentralOnline.com is West Central Saskatchewan's only source for community news and information such as weather and classifieds.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/templates/gantry/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "keywords": "westcentral, rosetown, kindersley, online, resources, news, saskatchewan, town, city, news, weather, classifieds, business, jobs, events, calendar, agriculture, sports", "author": "Angela Wingert", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "url": "https://westcentralonline.com/local/new-year-new-resolution-tips-to-help-achieve-this-year-s-goal", "title": "New Year, New Resolution-Tips to Help Achieve This Year&#039;s Goal - Westcentralonline.com", "description": "WestCentralOnline.com is West Central Saskatchewan&#039;s only source for community news and information such as weather and classifieds.", "image": "https://westcentralonline.com/images/IMG_0480.jpg"}, "description": "WestCentralOnline.com is West Central Saskatchewan's only source for community news and information such as weather and classifieds.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "fb": {"app_id": 2008384952706265, "admins": 563760633}, "og": {"title": "New Year, New Resolution-Tips to Help Achieve This Year's Goal - Westcentralonline.com", "type": "article", "url": "https://westcentralonline.com/local/new-year-new-resolution-tips-to-help-achieve-this-year-s-goal", "site_name": "Westcentralonline.com", "description": "WestCentralOnline.com is West Central Saskatchewan's only source for community news and information such as weather and classifieds.", "image": "https://westcentralonline.com/images/IMG_0480.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://westcentralonline.com/local/new-year-new-resolution-tips-to-help-achieve-this-year-s-goal"}
