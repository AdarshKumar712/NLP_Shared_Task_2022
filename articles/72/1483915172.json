We\u2019re sorry about this and we\u2019re working to have it back to normal soon.\u201d\n\nLloyds said its IT team had identified the problem and had fixed it. The problem only affected the login but it said online and mobile banking was now 75% back to normal and would be fully back within the next 20 minutes. The company said telephone banking and ATM transactions had not been affected by the problem.\n\nWith 22 million current account customers, Lloyds Banking Group is the UK\u2019s largest provider and also offers the most \u201cbasic\u201d or social bank accounts. It has 13 million active online customers, of which more than 9 million are mobile users. All of them were potentially affected.\n\nA spokeswoman was unable to say whether customers would get any compensation but added that anyone who had incurred charges as a result of the outage should get in touch with the bank.\n\nCustomers took to social media to complain about the situation. Many reported that they could not access banking services via the web or through their mobile app.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Banking", "Lloyds Banking Group", "Business", "UK news", "Consumer affairs", "Money"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Julia Kollewe"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Millions of customers were affected but online and mobile banking is 75% back to normal", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/fee5e2d638d1c35f6d501fa397e53329/152x152.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Millions of customers were affected but online and mobile banking is 75% back to normal", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Julia Kollewe", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7904dc38e7343159753f992f301150330761c2eb/43_70_5548_3329/master/5548.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f8a572376c50851dc449f9cab375c8aa", "keywords": "Banking,Lloyds Banking Group,Business,UK news,Consumer affairs,Money", "news_keywords": "Banking,Lloyds Banking Group,Business,UK news,Consumer affairs,Money", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/01/lloyds-halifax-and-bank-of-scotland-online-banking-systems-crash", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7904dc38e7343159753f992f301150330761c2eb/43_70_5548_3329/master/5548.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7a097d32eb10beb3e0d671b52c8e890c", "description": "Millions of customers were affected but online and mobile banking is 75% back to normal", "type": "article", "title": "Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland online banking systems crash", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/juliakollewe", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2020-01-01T11:38:10.000Z", "tag": "Banking,Lloyds Banking Group,Business,UK news,Consumer affairs,Money", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T12:30:27.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://business/2020/jan/01/lloyds-halifax-and-bank-of-scotland-online-banking-systems-crash?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://business/2020/jan/01/lloyds-halifax-and-bank-of-scotland-online-banking-systems-crash?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/01/lloyds-halifax-and-bank-of-scotland-online-banking-systems-crash", "iphone": "gnmguardian://business/2020/jan/01/lloyds-halifax-and-bank-of-scotland-online-banking-systems-crash?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7904dc38e7343159753f992f301150330761c2eb/43_70_5548_3329/master/5548.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=941ea5979f024564f8f78e9d6d9a2af4", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/01/lloyds-halifax-and-bank-of-scotland-online-banking-systems-crash"}
