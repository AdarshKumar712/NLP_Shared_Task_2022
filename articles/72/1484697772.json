Mr Schluter is moving to Adelaide in mid January after arriving in the region 19 years ago and living at the Nyroca Camp, nine kilometres north of Wangary, for about 15 years. He said he had always intended to move back to Adelaide and the timing was right, and he held a senior Freemasons position which demanded his time there. However Mr Schluter is happy to see how much the campsite had developed in the past 15 years and how many people had stayed. \"Thousands have stayed here, it's been quite an incredible experience,\" he said. \"It's a Scout property, I was a Queen's Scout as a young man and always had a fondness for the scouting movement. \"Another organisation who played a major role in the campsite and its development was the Rotary Club of Port Lincoln...the club contributed financially in the building of the new bridge across the creek.\" Guests to the camp included former Governor of South Australia Marjorie Jackson-Nelson who attended the commissioning of a new building on the campsite and a new Freemason fire tank. Mr Schluter said one experience he remembered was when the campsite was opened up as a volunteer bushfire recovery base in the aftermath of the Wangary bushfire in 2005. \"The government paid for the facility to be used for nine months, up to 40 people staying here on a daily basis being dispatched to burnt farm areas to assist with the recovery,\" he said. Mr Schluter had also been active in the region as a policeman, retiring as chief inspector of the region in 2005 after 43 years of service to SAPOL. He has also been warden of St Matthius Anglican Church in Wangary and said church life had been important to him as well. He said during his time living on the Lower Eyre Peninsula he made several observations of the people and the lifestyle of the region, both of which he and his wife Janet would miss once they depart. \"The beauty of this part of the country is that you meet someone and five minutes later he's your best friend,\" he said. \"If you do a favour for someone it is inevitably returned in some kind of repayment or kindness. \"The rusticated lifestyle Janet and I have been able to create is simply marvelous.\"\n\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/aBKzLMK3eEVPvPkN7ieSYk/0183f845-1172-4dad-b7c6-36e5f8fa5100.JPG/r233_587_5920_3800_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jarrad Delaney"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 14:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Malcolm Schluter is moving on after living nearly 20 years on Lower Eyre Peninsula, and spending 15 years living at and caring fore Nyroca Camp.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//nnstatic-a.akamaihd.net/s/1576119584/sites/port-lincoln-times/ico/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "title": "Nyroca Camp manager moving on after 15 years", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Malcolm Schluter is moving on after living nearly 20 years on Lower Eyre Peninsula, and spending 15 years living at and caring fore Nyroca Camp.", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/portlincolntimes/", "published_time": "2020-01-02T14:00:00+10:30"}, "og": {"title": "Schluter a happy camper about time on Lower Eyre", "url": "https://www.portlincolntimes.com.au/story/6554468/schluter-a-happy-camper-about-time-on-lower-eyre/", "site_name": "Port Lincoln Times", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/aBKzLMK3eEVPvPkN7ieSYk/0183f845-1172-4dad-b7c6-36e5f8fa5100.JPG/r233_587_5920_3800_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "secure_url": "https://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/aBKzLMK3eEVPvPkN7ieSYk/0183f845-1172-4dad-b7c6-36e5f8fa5100.JPG/r233_587_5920_3800_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 678, "width": 1200}, "description": "Malcolm Schluter is moving on after living nearly 20 years on Lower Eyre Peninsula, and spending 15 years living at and caring fore Nyroca Camp."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ptlincolntimes", "title": "Schluter a happy camper about time on Lower Eyre", "description": "Malcolm Schluter is moving on after living nearly 20 years on Lower Eyre Peninsula, and spending 15 years living at and caring fore Nyroca Camp.", "image": "https://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/aBKzLMK3eEVPvPkN7ieSYk/0183f845-1172-4dad-b7c6-36e5f8fa5100.JPG/r233_587_5920_3800_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}, "news_keywords": "community, Nyroca, Camp, Lower, Eyre, Peninsula, Wangary", "author": "Jarrad Delaney", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msvalidate.01": "F29B95B17E7034DD0832B3DBEF37C0F2"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.portlincolntimes.com.au/story/6554468/schluter-a-happy-camper-about-time-on-lower-eyre/"}
