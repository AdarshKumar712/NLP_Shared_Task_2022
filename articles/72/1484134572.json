He went on to start 29 straight games the last two years while making 77 tackles, five tackles for loss, three sacks, seven QB hits seven passes defended, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery.\n\nHe ranked 80th among the 88 linebackers who qualified for a grade this year, according to ProFootballFocus. But the Lions love his fit to the scheme and actually signed him to an extension in November that runs through 2021.\n\nGM Bob Quinn doesn\u2019t usually like to negotiate midseason, but wanted to keep Jones in Detroit for the foreseeable.\n\n\"Really good scheme fit for what we do, very versatile,\u201d said Quinn, who was making his first public comments since extending Jones. \u201cAs you guys know, when we\u2019re trying to build the front seven, it\u2019s really hard to find linebackers that can play on the line of scrimmage and off. I think Christian has obviously shown he can do that at a good level.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Flavor", "Michigan\u2019s Best Day"], "authors": ["Kyle Meinke", "Kylemeinke Mlive.Com", "Kmeinke Mlive.Com"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 18:40:49 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/pf/resources/images/mlive/favicon.ico?d=139", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435, "app_id": 132720883409479}, "title": "Newly-extended LB Christian Jones undergoes surgery for Lions", "og": {"title": "Newly-extended LB Christian Jones undergoes surgery for Lions", "url": "https://www.mlive.com/lions/2019/12/newly-extended-lb-christian-jones-undergoes-surgery-for-lions.html", "site_name": "mlive", "type": "article", "description": "Jones suffered a shoulder injury late in the season and is expected to require at least two to four months of rehab.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.mlive.com/resizer/gihKFWLN7RAOfthF6vyqmTVjfdc=/1280x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XEP2DP4DMJCCRBMTGLDXBHVMVM.JPG", "width": 1280}}, "article": {"published_time": "2019-12-31T18:40:49.415Z", "modified_time": "2019-12-31T18:41:45.688Z", "section": "Lions", "tag": "@mlive-river"}, "twitter": {"title": "Newly-extended LB Christian Jones undergoes surgery for Lions", "site": "@mlive", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jones suffered a shoulder injury late in the season and is expected to require at least two to four months of rehab.", "image": "https://www.mlive.com/resizer/gihKFWLN7RAOfthF6vyqmTVjfdc=/1280x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XEP2DP4DMJCCRBMTGLDXBHVMVM.JPG"}, "article_publication_name": "https://www.mlive.com/lions/2019/12/newly-extended-lb-christian-jones-undergoes-surgery-for-lions.html", "article_date_original": "Tuesday, December 31, 2019, 01:40 PM", "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, December 31, 2019, 01:41 PM", "Description": "Jones suffered a shoulder injury late in the season and is expected to require at least two to four months of rehab.", "article_author": "Kyle Meinke | kylemeinke@mlive.com"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.mlive.com/lions/2019/12/newly-extended-lb-christian-jones-undergoes-surgery-for-lions.html"}
