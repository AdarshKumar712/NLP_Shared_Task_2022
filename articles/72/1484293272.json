for the UN-recognised government said.\n\nThe deadly violence comes just a day before the Turkish parliament votes on Thursday to deploy troops to Tripoli following the request of the UN-backed government.\n\nMore:\n\n\"Three were killed and three wounded in an air raid on Al-Sawani,\" Amin al-Hachemi, spokesman for the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord, told AFP news agency.\n\nAl-Sawani lies around 25km (15 miles) south of the capital and under GNA control.\n\nTripoli's southern suburbs have been hit by deadly fighting since eastern strongman Khalifa Haftar launched an offensive against the capital in early April.\n\nSeveral shops were badly damaged in the air raid, Hachemi said.\n\nOn their Facebook page, forces loyal to the GNA published pictures of badly damaged buildings and vehicles, and accused pro-Haftar forces of carrying out the raid.\n\nGNA forces said in a statement that they had captured 25 pro-Haftar fighters on Wednesday.\n\nLibya has been mired in conflict since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed dictator Moamer Kadhafi, with rival administrations in the east and west vying for power.\n\nAccording to UN figures published last month, clashes around Tripoli since April 4 have killed more than 280 civilians and 2,000 fighters, while over 140,000 people have been forced to flee their homes.\n\nEarlier, the UN envoy to Libya accused Security Council members of violating an arms embargo.\n\nGhassan Salame also said that there are concerns about foreign fighters being flown into Libya, adding that the deal signed between Turkey and the Tripoli government represents an \"escalation\" of the conflict in the North African country.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkish Vice President Foad Oktay said Turkish troops may not be deployed if Gen Khalifa Haftar and his troops, who have been trying to seize the capital since April, will halt their offensive.\n\nEmad Badi, analyst at Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera that the inaction of countries, like the US and France has allowed countries like Russia and Turkey to come fill the vacuum, as the violence continues.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [],
