Hundreds of workers from other departments also keep TTSH in operation, putting their own health at risk too.\n\nPeople doing the laundry for example, have to clean all the patients\u2019 linen and ensure everything is spotless for the next person who checks in.\n\nSource\n\nPharmacists have to distribute the correct medication according to patients\u2019 needs, and their attention to detail is particularly crucial to ensure no mistakes.\n\nSource\n\nService staff the first faces you see at Tan Tock Seng Hospital\n\nBefore you even enter the premises to witness all the above, service staff like this security officer will greet you.\n\nSource\n\nStaff at the information counter help visitors navigate their way around. Imagine the sheer number of people they have to interact with on a regular basis, yet they continue to do so wholeheartedly.\n\nSource\n\nLet\u2019s salute our healthcare heroes\n\nAll hospital staff, regardless of what they do, deserve our appreciation for their unwavering dedication to their work.\n\nThey come to the hospital every day despite risking their own health, to help so many others in need.\n\nSource\n\nThey work tirelessly for hours on end with little rest in a job that requires a lot of physical and mental tenacity, despite occasionally receiving undue criticism from people.\n\nLet\u2019s thank our healthcare workers for their efforts, because we wouldn\u2019t be able to manage a crisis without them. They truly are our heroes.\n\nFeatured image adapted from Facebook and Facebook.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Singapore coronavirus", "tan tock seng hospital", "nurses", "Coronavirus", "wuhan virus"], "authors": ["Fayyadhah Spends Most Of Her Free Time Wondering Why There'S Nothing Fun To Do", "Wastes The Rest Of Her Time On Netflix."], "publish_date": "Sun Feb  9 06:36:57 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "As Singapore goes into panic mode over the novel coronavirus, staff across all departments at Tan Tock Seng Hospital are working hard to attend to patients.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://mustsharenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://mustsharenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tan-tock-seng-hospital-staff.jpg", "secure_url": "https://mustsharenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tan-tock-seng-hospital-staff.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 750}, "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Tan Tock Seng Hospital Shares Photos Of Staff Working Hard To Fight Coronavirus, Praises Our \"Healthcare Heroes\"", "description": "As Singapore goes into panic mode over the novel coronavirus, staff across all departments at Tan Tock Seng Hospital are working hard to attend to patients.", "url": "https://mustsharenews.com/tan-tock-seng-hospital-staff/", "site_name": "Must Share News - Independent News For Singaporeans", "updated_time": "2020-02-09T06:37:35+00:00"}, "description": "As Singapore goes into panic mode over the novel coronavirus, staff across all departments at Tan Tock Seng Hospital are working hard to attend to patients.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mustsharenews", "tag": "wuhan virus", "section": "Health", "published_time": "2020-02-09T06:36:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-09T06:37:35+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "As Singapore goes into panic mode over the novel coronavirus, staff across all departments at Tan Tock Seng Hospital are working hard to attend to patients.", "title": "Tan Tock Seng Hospital Shares Photos Of Staff Working Hard To Fight Coronavirus, Praises Our \"Healthcare Heroes\"", "site": "@MustShareNews", "image": "https://mustsharenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tan-tock-seng-hospital-staff.jpg", "creator": "@MustShareNews"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "fb": {"pages": 292279440975148}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://mustsharenews.com/tan-tock-seng-hospital-staff/?ia_markup=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://mustsharenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cropped-favicon-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://mustsharenews.com/tan-tock-seng-hospital-staff/"}
