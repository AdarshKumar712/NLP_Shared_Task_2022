And I think Matt Reeves does as well. You can do crazy stuff with that part,\" Pattinson told Empire magazine. The actor made a case for an R-rated version of the film, adding the rating would allow the makers to test different waters.\n\n\"The only thing that's more complicated is the rating. As soon as you make something an R-rated movie, you're freed up to do so much stuff,\" he said. The film is being billed as a grounded take on the Dark Knight and will feature many of Batman's villains. Reeves is directing from his own script. He is also attached to produce with Dylan Clark. \"The Batman\" will hit the screens on June 25, 2021.\n\nCatch up on all the latest entertainment news and gossip here.
