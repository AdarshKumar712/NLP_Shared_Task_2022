From George McAfee to Gale Sayers to Walter Payton to Jerry Azumah to Danieal Manning to Devin Hester, there is no NFL team with a richer history of kick returners.\n\nCordarrelle Patterson is the latest in a long line of successful kick returners in Chicago. But Patterson doesn\u2019t consider himself up there with two of the greatest returners of all-time: Hester or Sayers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing, but I\u2019m just trying to do my job,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cI would never be as great as Devin Hester or Gale Sayers. I just try to do my job each and every day, and it\u2019s just an honor to play on the same field those guys played on.\u201d\n\nHester and Sayers are two of the best returners in NFL history \u2014 and Hester is the greatest ever. But still, Patterson\u2019s career as a kick returner isn\u2019t something to turn your head at.\n\nPatterson, who has earned three Pro Bowl nods, ranks second all-time with a 29.9-yard kickoff return average. He has seven career kick return touchdowns, which is the third most in NFL history, just one behind co-leaders Leon Washington and Josh Cribbs.\n\nPatterson was one of the few bright spots in the Bears\u2019 disappointing 2019 season. In his first year in Chicago, Patterson finished second in the NFL with a 29.5-yard average on 28 kickoff returns, one of which was a 102-yard touchdown against the Saints. He also led the league with 825 kick-return yards.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["chicago bears", "bears", "cordarrelle patterson", "devin hester", "bears kick returners", "gale sayers", "george mcafee", "walter payton", "jerry azumah", "danieal manning", "2020 pro bowl"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Barbieri", "Brendan Sugrue", "Hours Ago"], "publish_date": "Fri Jan 24 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Bears have a rich legacy of kick returners in their 100-year history, and Cordarrelle Patterson is the latest.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/6c922c339e17f36a13070013837e858d?s=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The Bears have a rich legacy of kick returners in their 100-year history, and Cordarrelle Patterson is the latest.", "news_keywords": "Chicago Bears, Bears, Cordarrelle Patterson, Devin Hester, Bears kick returners, Gale Sayers, George McAfee, Walter Payton, Jerry Azumah, Danieal Manning, 2020 Pro Bowl", "keywords": "chicago bears, bears, cordarrelle patterson, devin hester, bears kick returners, gale sayers, george mcafee, walter payton, jerry azumah, danieal manning, 2020 pro bowl", "google-site-verification": "no3A69hVM5ut63_reMWqC5VegUmDtCMsgeO4Wh_iBY8", "msvalidate.01": "6C7AFE373C691E833D6444FFA7F6E8A2", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Cordarrelle Patterson talks Bears kick-returner legacy at Pro Bowl", "url": "https://bearswire.usatoday.com/2020/01/24/chicago-bears-kick-returner-legacy-cordarrelle-patterson-devin-hester-gale-sayers-pro-bowl/", "description": "The Bears have a rich legacy of kick returners in their 100-year history, and Cordarrelle Patterson is the latest.", "site_name": "Bears Wire", "image": {"identifier": "https://usatbearswire.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/gettyimages-1195487525.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-24T13:14:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-24T13:14:10+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheBearsWire/?fref=ts"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@TheBearsWire", "site": "@thebearswire", "text": {"title": "Cordarrelle Patterson talks Bears kick-returner legacy at Pro Bowl"}, "image": "https://usatbearswire.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/gettyimages-1195487525.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "gdpr": "false", "application-name": "Bears Wire", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Your place for all Chicago Bears news, rumors, updates and information.", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://bearswire.usatoday.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/6c922c339e17f36a13070013837e858d?s=16"}, "canonical_link": "https://bearswire.usatoday.com/2020/01/24/chicago-bears-kick-returner-legacy-cordarrelle-patterson-devin-hester-gale-sayers-pro-bowl/"}
