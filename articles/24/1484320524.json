zero deaths\n\n\u201cOne injury is one too many and our society has to do more to discontinue the bloody and polluting tradition of ringing in the New Year with firecrackers and fireworks, legal or not,\u201d Thony Dizon, EcoWaste chemical safety campaigner, said.\n\nDepartment of Health on Wednesday reported that 164 firecracker-related injuries were recorded from December 21 to January 1, 35% lower than 251 cases registered in the same period last year.\n\nAlthough there is no case of firecracker ingestion, stray bullet injury and death reported, DOH still failed to achieve its goal of zero casualty.\n\nAmong the top firecrackers causing injuries were kwitis (33), luces (19), fountain (18) and piccolo (13).\n\nLegally sold firecrackers accounted for 59% of all injuries, while illegal fireworks for 32% and unknown fireworks for 10%.\n\n\u201cAs there is no such thing as non-dangerous and non-toxic firecrackers and fireworks, our society has to make difficult decisions in order to protect public health and the environment, including phasing out the production of firecrackers and fireworks and finding alternative livelihoods for the affected sector,\u201d Dizon said.\n\nDizon added: \u201cTo achieve zero injury and zero pollution during the New Year revelry, we need to seriously look at banning firecrackers and fireworks altogether.\u201d\n\nSince becoming Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte\u2014who was a longtime Davao City mayor\u2014has imposed his hometown formula nationwide and ordered strict regulation of the sale and use of firecrackers.\n\nIn 2018, the chief executive ordered the Philippine National Police to confiscate and destroy prohibited fireworks. He also directed that the issuance of new licenses and permits is also suspended, pending the compliance review of those who have licenses and permits.\n\nEarlier in 2017, he signed Executive Order 28, which limits the use of firecrackers to community fireworks display. \u2014 Gaea Katreena Cabico", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["department of health", "ecowaste coalition", "firecracker-related injuries"], "tags": ["ECOWASTE COALITION", "DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH", "COVER STORIES", "SOUTH CHINA SEA", "CHINA COAST GUARD", "EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE", "FIRECRACKER-RELATED INJURIES", "FACT CHECKS", "EXPLAINERS", "PHILIPPINES-CHINA TIES", "BUILD BUILD BUILD PROJECTS", "CHINA"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "In a statement EcoWaste Coalition said it is dismayed by the injuries inflicted by both legal and illegal fireworks, especially on young victims.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.philstar.com/images/Home/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "-XDnbcliO_8moaHtwWwt6bfL7OuZJxdwORPCeqtmRZU", "msvalidate.01": "A420D7D07ED09E5C42E6F71783C169FE", "dailymotion-domain-verification": "dmnqtuxevpqh4qp3c", "keywords": "department of health,ecowaste coalition,firecracker-related injuries", "description": "In a statement EcoWaste Coalition said it is dismayed by the injuries inflicted by both legal and illegal fireworks, especially on young victims.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=532930273", "fb": {"app_id": 1775905922621109}, "og": {"type": "website", "title": "Total ban on firecrackers needed to stop 'bloody, polluting' New Year tradition \u2014 green group | Philstar.com", "url": "https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2020/01/02/1981462/total-ban-firecrackers-needed-stop-bloody-polluting-new-year-tradition-green-group", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.philstar.com/photos/2020/01/02/total-ban-firecrackers-fireworks_2020-01-02_10-52-31.jpg", "url": "https://media.philstar.com/photos/2020/01/02/total-ban-firecrackers-fireworks_2020-01-02_10-52-31.jpg"}, "description": "In a statement EcoWaste Coalition said it is dismayed by the injuries inflicted by both legal and illegal fireworks, especially on young victims.", "site_name": "philstar.com"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@philstarnews", "creator": "@philstarnews", "description": "In a statement EcoWaste Coalition said it is dismayed by the injuries inflicted by both legal and illegal fireworks, especially on young victims.", "title": "Total ban on firecrackers needed to stop 'bloody, polluting' New Year tradition \u2014 green group | Philstar.com", "image": "https://media.philstar.com/photos/2020/01/02/total-ban-firecrackers-fireworks_2020-01-02_10-52-31.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-signin-scope": "profile email", "google-signin-client_id": "901299274787-uhltbpsq076q893g1pbfe765frnelm5j.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2020/01/02/1981462/total-ban-firecrackers-needed-stop-bloody-polluting-new-year-tradition-green-group"}
