Avoid overtaking unless you're sure it's safe.\n\nSober: If driving, don't drink any alcohol, or take any illegal drugs or medication that could affect driving.\n\nSharp: Drive alert \u2013 not tired, ill or stressed. Plan your journey so you have plenty of time, and take breaks every two hours on long journeys. Have an eye test at least every two years and wear glasses or contact lenses if needed.\n\nSilent: Phone off or on message service. Minimise other distractions such as sat nav/GPS and tuning the radio as much as possible.\n\nSecure: Always belt up and insist that everyone else in the vehicle does the same and adjusts head restraints. If travelling with children, ensure you have correctly fitted, appropriate child restraints.\n\nSustainable: Only drive when you have to.\n\nSource: Brake, the road safety charity", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["New Zealand", "Northern Advocate", "Northland Age", "Traffic", "Emergency Services", "Front Page - Top Stories", "Auckland Region", "Northland"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Traffic on SH1 is expected to be busy with holiday journeys most of the day.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/pb/resources/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Traffic on SH1 is expected to be busy with holiday journeys most of the day.", "keywords": "New Zealand,Northern Advocate,Northland Age,Traffic,Emergency Services,Front Page - Top Stories,Auckland Region,Northland", "news_keywords": "New Zealand,Northern Advocate,Northland Age,Traffic,Emergency Services,Front Page - Top Stories,Auckland Region,Northland", "twitter": {"site": "@nzherald", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@nzherald", "description": "Traffic on SH1 is expected to be busy with holiday journeys most of the day.", "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/vWokE_JXIUoVPNFVy0AfaDPdRzQ=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7WXORZAMJBEV5B2TGLYI3GUX3Q.jpg", "title": "Holiday traffic: Auckland Harbour Bridge crash adds to heavy delays as holidaymakers head north"}, "og": {"description": "Traffic on SH1 is expected to be busy with holiday journeys most of the day.", "type": "article", "site_name": "NZ Herald", "locale": "en_NZ", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/vWokE_JXIUoVPNFVy0AfaDPdRzQ=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7WXORZAMJBEV5B2TGLYI3GUX3Q.jpg", "alt": "The delays are expected near the Puhoi tunnel, as pictured yesterday.
