There aren\u2019t a ton of stars, meaning the rosters are filled with people that make you say \u201coh yeah, that guy.\u201d Many of those people you\u2019ve forgotten about are undoubtedly former Yankees, so let\u2019s check in on how they\u2019re doing down in the Caribbean.\n\nWe\u2019ll start in the Dominican Republic with the Gigantes del Cibao, where a recently relevant Yankee has gotten some playing time. After missing all of the 2019 MLB season, Greg Bird turn up in the DR, and well...\n\nBird has played in seven games for the Gigantes, and has gone 3-for-24 with no extra-base hits. On the pitching side of that team is brief Yankee Jose Ramirez and also 2019 teammate Adonis Rosa. Considering that Bird\u2019s last Yankee game last year was in April, and Rosa\u2019s lone appearance came in August, there\u2019s a non-zero chance neither of them realize they were, technically, teammates in 2019.\n\nOn the Aguilas Cibenas is the most random set of former Yankees who are now teammates. One-game wonder Brady Lail is on the same team as Cesar Cabral, who is most famous for getting ejected seemingly for safety reasons after hitting three Rays in a row in 2014. It may not come as a surprise that, even though he\u2019s only thrown 2.1 innings, he has hit a batter.\n\nNestor Cortes Jr. is playing for the Estrellas de Oriente and somehow having a worse time than he did with the Yankees. Cortes has faced 24 batters, and allowed a hit or walk to literally half of them. He has a 13.50 ERA.\n\nIn Mexico, there is a group of former Yankees on the Tomateros de Culiacan. Manny Banuelos, Ramiro Pena, and Rico Noel are all there, and the guy doing the best of any of them is arguably the guy whose only job was running. Noel has a not great, but better than Pena, .767 OPS, while also stealing 29 bases in 30 games. Elsewhere in Mexico, Vidal Nuno is apparently now going by Vidal Nuno III, and he has a sub-3.00 ERA in over 30 innings.\n\nThere\u2019s just one former Yankee of note in Puerto Rico, and that\u2019s Jonathan Albaladejo. He\u2019s put up a 6.59 ERA in 13.2 innings for the Indios de Mayaguez.\n\nThere\u2019s also not much to note in Venezuela, but Alberto Gonzalez is there. You may not remember him as he was one of the cavalcade of infielders the 2013 Yankees threw at the wall to see if anything stuck. Considering that he went 6-for-34 and is arguably more famous for having to pitch a game that season, if you don\u2019t remember him, you didn\u2019t miss much.\n\nAs for how he\u2019s doing in Venezuela, he has a .389 OBP. He\u2019s drawn 17 walks compared to just eight strikeouts. Not bad. Meanwhile, his OPS with the Yankees back in 2013 was .382, so it\u2019s safe to say he\u2019s found his level.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Matt Ferenchick", "Jan"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "From Greg Bird to Ramiro Pena, former Yankees of all sorts have been playing in winter leagues this offseason.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/blog/favicon/11/favicon-2c5be2ba.73994.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Pinstripe Alley", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pinstripealley", "published_time": "2020-01-01T12:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T12:00:00-05:00"}, "author": "Matt Ferenchick", "style-tools": "https://www.sbnation.com/style/community/11/7b5c52b4ace54635dd185006b5d0f796/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "description": "From Greg Bird to Ramiro Pena, former Yankees of all sorts have been playing in winter leagues this offseason.", "og": {"description": "From Greg Bird to Ramiro Pena, former Yankees of all sorts have been playing in winter leagues this offseason.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XEHjtSH2uqbMFlR33LTvW-GD4GI=/0x0:3781x1980/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19566316/1142494705.jpg.jpg", "alt": "Chicago White Sox v New York Yankees", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Pinstripe Alley", "title": "How are some former Yankees doing in the Caribbean winter leagues?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pinstripealley.com/2020/1/1/21044967/yankees-roster-caribbean-world-series-greg-bird-manny-banuelos-ramiro-pena-vidal-nuno"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.pinstripealley.com/2020/1/1/21044967/yankees-roster-caribbean-world-series-greg-bird-manny-banuelos-ramiro-pena-vidal-nuno", "title": "How are some former Yankees doing in the Caribbean winter leagues?", "description": "From Greg Bird to Ramiro Pena, former Yankees of all sorts have been playing in winter leagues this offseason.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zFtEdXMiYp8SZ9SJmCMLJCmTiZs=/0x0:3781x1891/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19566316/1142494705.jpg.jpg", "alt": "Chicago White Sox v New York Yankees"}, "site": "pinstripealley"}, "sailthru.title": "How are some former Yankees doing in the Caribbean winter leagues?", "sailthru.tags": "mlb,baseball,new-york-yankees,pinstripe-alley,front-page,yankees-humor-satire-funny", "sailthru.description": "From Greg Bird to Ramiro Pena, former Yankees of all sorts have been playing in winter leagues this offseason.", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-01T12:00:00-05:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ov4WDfz8Mu5nXV6wXw4wz2rR6M4=/0x0:3781x2127/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66005030/1142494705.jpg.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LMybysfp0EhpIWujQQy6IncegFQ=/872x0:3593x2721/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66005030/1142494705.jpg.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/blog/sbnu_logo_minimal/11/touch_icon_ipad_retina_pinstripealley.com.minimal.73994.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#0f213c", "outbrainsection": "yankees-humor-satire-funny"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.pinstripealley.com/2020/1/1/21044967/yankees-roster-caribbean-world-series-greg-bird-manny-banuelos-ramiro-pena-vidal-nuno"}
