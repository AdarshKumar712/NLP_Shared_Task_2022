In \"rare circumstances,\" according to Landry's, payment cards may have been swiped through those devices between March 13, 2019 to October 17, 2019. A \"small number\" of locations were reportedly affected as early as January 2019.\n\nCustomers with questions or concerns can call 833-991-1538 from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m for more information.\n\nTRY THE APP: Get alerts, breaking news and in-depth coverage on what's happening in Houston for your mobile phone and tablet devices through our mobile apps on Google Play and the App Store.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Darla Guillen Gilthorpe", "Houston Chronicle"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 10:17:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "ispremium": 0, "dc.date": "2020-01-01T16:17:47Z", "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T16:17:47Z", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T18:08:33Z", "opinion": "false"}, "SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "news_keywords": "Tilman Fertitta, Landry, Houston, Google Play, App Store", "nlpPerson": "Tilman Fertitta", "nlpLocation": "Landry, Houston", "nlpOther": "Google Play, App Store", "nlpCategories": "%2FComputers+%26+Electronics%2FEnterprise+Technology,%2FBusiness+%26+Industrial%2FBusiness+Services%2FE-Commerce+Services", "sailthru.title": "Landry\u2019s issues notice of a payment security incident", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-01 10:17:00 -0600", "sailthru.author": "Darla Guillen Gilthorpe, Houston Chronicle", "sailthru_type": "article", "sailthru_uid": 14943351, "sailthru_section": "business", "sailthru_pubname": "houston-chronicle", "sailthru_siteid": 21, "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/03/17/71/17628744/24/sailthruImage.jpg", "og": {"title": "Landry\u2019s issues notice of a payment security incident", "description": "Landry's, Inc. - the restaurant chain from local billionaire Tilman Fertitta - is alerting the public of a recent security incident involving payment processing that may have affected some customers.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.chron.com/business/article/Landrys-Tilman-Fertitta-payment-card-data-security-14943351.php", "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/03/17/71/17628744/24/rawImage.jpg", "site_name": "Houston Chronicle"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@houstonchron"}, "fb": {"admins": 100006394927810, "app_id": 314935171989989, "pages": "105702905593,307851324523,12852567813,480760515417232,288240529145,316774245761,984197758297116,7457442370,207033189701,207346283795,222959748728,207042068180,72983690774,339413234035,343689323559,345828366626,234821559861394,335699426867,10150105039485602,338983127562,364516539001,337922332042,115637335153191,372011535931,333376634908,127590790608884,141923885872653,655037391286291,320774811368833,1740489152861748,469700473093040,386754203367,556449374478585,340999853450,350771491032,1120648627959218,342017778245,338463361591,138772706196968,1641688532739111,326312697536,353120110016,343366744658,335009494554,347261603104,350924013892,257724773860,361203926417,367174215398,284154645394,334501182354,350279743224,154340691263654,147848678611852,361381078011,362831597677,10150095255780118"}, "msvalidate.01": "9451CA04ABC9D1D5C6419C73B4C4F7B7"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.chron.com/business/article/Landrys-Tilman-Fertitta-payment-card-data-security-14943351.php"}
