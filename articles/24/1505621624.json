They demanded that Bexte produced an ID and claimed that it was illegal for him to be on the scene.\n\nWhen Bexte stayed and continued to ask Greta questions, the bodyguards did not hesitate to apply physical force. Two of them reportedly punched Bexte several times and one of them hit him in the stomach. The attack was captured on film and featured in Rebel News' recent documentary.\n\nWe had only spoken once prior to this. Even though I was on the other side of the world, wearing a parka, and we hadn't spoken in months- Greta hadn't been asked a tough question since last seeing me. Greta recognized me because I ask tough questions. SAD. https://t.co/LWfXy2g9oj pic.twitter.com/oJeYpSndCM \u2014 Keean Bexte \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea (@TheRealKeean) January 25, 2020\n\n\u200b\u201cI flew to Stockholm, Sweden, to watch Greta\u2019s so-called 'school strikes' for myself, because I don\u2019t trust the mainstream media narrative that she is the guardian of her own agenda\u201d, Bexte said. \u201cBut within minutes of appearing at one of Greta\u2019s marches, as I tried to ask her some questions about her protest movement, I was punched in the gut and shoved away by a plain-clothed security guard \u2013 in fact, two of them threatened me and told me to 'f**k off!'\", he continued. \u201cAfter that, I knew I was on to something\u201d, he concluded his account.\n\nAccording to Bexte, Greta Thunberg's rise to celebrity status is not haphazard.\n\n\u201cHer canonization as a climate saint was coordinated and executed by a cabal of left-wing eco-elites \u2013 including her parents and their famous friends\u201d, he wrote.\n\nNEW: @GretaThunberg has elite security following her at home and on her intercontinental field trip. Kids were trained to act as a hidden security screen for the Climate Crusader. In Stockholm, well, lets just say they weren't kids pushing me around\n\nWATCH: https://t.co/LWfXy2g9oj pic.twitter.com/p25sJc29zf \u2014 Keean Bexte \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea (@TheRealKeean) January 24, 2020\n\n\u200b\n\nRentzhog, the founder of green social network start-up We Don\u2019t Have Time, admittedly helped Greta's rise to international fame by releasing a video after allegedly stumbling upon her \u201cby chance\u201d during her climate strike outside the house of parliament in Stockholm. Later, he backtracked on this story as it was revealed that he already knew her parents from before. Subsequently, he was accused of \u201ceco-profiteering\u201d for using Greta's name in promotional materials without her consent. Still, We Don't Have Time, continues to promote her work.\n\nGreta Thunberg, a 17-year-old teen with a 4-million-strong followship on Twitter, won numerous awards for her incessant activism and calls for fellow schoolchildren to strike in order to provoke more forceful climate action from the authorities. She insists on being \u201ccompletely independent\u201d and writing her speeches herself, which many have doubted \u2013 not least given her diagnosis of Asperger's and autism, as well as a medical record that includes eating disorders and depression.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["climate alarmism", "climate movement", "school protests", "climate protests", "investigative journalism", "Greta Thunberg"], "tags": ["Sweden", "journalism", "Stockholm", "Greta Thunberg"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Greta Thunberg, a frail schoolgirl activist, has become a poster child for the green movement, sparking rumours about massive support machinery running behind her.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/i/sputnik.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Greta Thunberg, a frail schoolgirl activist, has become a poster child for the green movement, sparking rumours about massive support machinery running behind her.", "keywords": "climate alarmism, climate movement, school protests, climate protests, investigative journalism, Greta Thunberg", "news_keywords": "climate alarmism, climate movement, school protests, climate protests, investigative journalism, Greta Thunberg", "robots": "all", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "ahrefs-site-verification": "ahrefs-site-verification_899ad24abeb428773ae480d902877f72151b81b12d4b7293cbfa1c452c76adcd", "analytics": {"site_domain": "sputniknews.com", "article_id": 1078147173, "p_ts": 1580109924, "rubric": "environment", "tags": "climate alarmism, climate movement, school protests, climate protests, investigative journalism, Greta Thunberg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SputnikInt", "url": "https://sputniknews.com/environment/202001271078147173-greta-thunbergs-bodyguards-harass-journalist-in-stockholm--video/", "title": "Greta Thunberg's Bodyguards Harassed Journalist in Stockholm \u2013 Video", "description": "Greta Thunberg, a frail schoolgirl activist, has become a poster child for the green movement, sparking rumours about massive support machinery running behind her.", "image": "https://sputniknews.com/sharing_snippet/1078147173.png?1580109924"}, "fb": {"app_id": 799135720145118, "pages": 357990416180}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=969452947, app-argument=com.sputniknews://article?issuer_id=17&issuer_article_id=1078147173", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.sputniknews.sputnik", "og": {"title": "Greta Thunberg's Bodyguards Harassed Journalist in Stockholm \u2013 Video", "url": "https://sputniknews.com/environment/202001271078147173-greta-thunbergs-bodyguards-harass-journalist-in-stockholm--video/", "type": "website", "description": "Greta Thunberg, a frail schoolgirl activist, has become a poster child for the green movement, sparking rumours about massive support machinery running behind her.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn5.img.sputniknews.com/images/107813/74/1078137451.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 440}}, "lastmod": "2020-01-27T07:25:25Z", "pubdate": "2020-01-27T07:25:24Z", "url_type": "usual"}, "canonical_link": "https://sputniknews.com/environment/202001271078147173-greta-thunbergs-bodyguards-harass-journalist-in-stockholm--video/"}
