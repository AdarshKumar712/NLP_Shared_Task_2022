He served in the position with the Jacksonville Jaguars for nine seasons from 2003 through 2011, when he was fired after Week 12. He was also the head coach of the Oakland Raiders from 2015 through 2017.\n\nThe 56-year-old finished with a 93-94 record and never advanced past the divisional round of the playoffs as a head coach, but he did as a defensive assistant.\n\nHe was the linebackers coach for the Baltimore Ravens from 1999 through 2001, the defensive coordinator for the Carolina Panthers in 2002 and the defensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos from 2012 through 2014.\n\nBaltimore won a Super Bowl during his tenure with Ray Lewis leading his linebackers unit, and Denver reached a Super Bowl but lost. In four seasons as a defensive coordinator, Del Rio directed groups that finished in the top three in the league in yards allowed three times.\n\nWhat's more, the 2000 Ravens defense he was involved with allowed three, 10, three and seven points (on a kickoff return and the point after) in four playoff games before lifting the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nThe Redskins now have a coach with championship pedigree and a track record of success who brings name recognition to that side of the ball.\n\nDel Rio will take the reins of a unit that ranked 27th in total defense and 27th in points allowed under Greg Manusky in 2019.\n\nWhile there is work to be done, Del Rio will have plenty of talent, including safety Landon Collins and a strong line that features Jonathan Allen, Matt Ioannidis and Montez Sweat.\n\nThe Redskins also own the No. 2 overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft, which they could use to select Ohio State defensive end Chase Young.\n\nOffensively, Washington ranked 31st in yards and 32nd in scoring under O'Connell, but he is viewed as a brilliant young offensive mind and helped rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins Jr. and wide receiver Terry McLaurin improve over the course of the season, which could help him appeal to Rivera.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["NFL", "Washington Redskins", "Jack Del Rio", "Bill Callahan", "Breaking News", "Kevin OConnell", "Ron Rivera", "Jay Gruden"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Scott Polacek"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "New  Washington Redskins  head coach Ron Rivera reportedly hired  Jack Del Rio  as his defensive coordinator Wednesday, according to ESPN's  Adam Schefter ...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static-assets.bleacherreport.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"aol-te-auth": "1c424580-0f86-4d9b-88b2-bc8c0d029d4c", "blitz": "mu-6e4ce5cd-57f20d11-7c0ecee9-d55c79e2", "msvalidate.01": "7A63840181953B2A5A1FEA25FB45A991", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "verify-v1": "+Ntj422Jc4V03qgBqLYbF3LMvrursV0X2btn2Zoqn9w=", "description": "New  Washington Redskins  head coach Ron Rivera reportedly hired  Jack Del Rio  as his defensive coordinator Wednesday, according to ESPN's  Adam Schefter ...", "keywords": "NFL, Washington Redskins, Jack Del Rio, Bill Callahan, Breaking News, Kevin OConnell, Ron Rivera, Jay Gruden", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 135174055162}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "teamstream://article/bleacherreport.com/articles/2819321-redskins-rumors-jack-del-rio-hired-as-dc-callahan-most-of-defensive-staff-out", "app_store_id": 418075935, "app_name": "Bleacher Report"}, "ipad": {"url": "teamstream://article/bleacherreport.com/articles/2819321-redskins-rumors-jack-del-rio-hired-as-dc-callahan-most-of-defensive-staff-out", "app_store_id": 484725748, "app_name": "Bleacher Report"}, "android": {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2819321-redskins-rumors-jack-del-rio-hired-as-dc-callahan-most-of-defensive-staff-out", "app_name": "Bleacher Report", "package": "com.bleacherreport.android.teamstream"}, "web": {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2819321-redskins-rumors-jack-del-rio-hired-as-dc-callahan-most-of-defensive-staff-out"}}, "og": {"site_name": "Bleacher Report", "locale": "en_US", "description": "New  Washington Redskins  head coach Ron Rivera reportedly hired  Jack Del Rio  as his defensive coordinator Wednesday, according to ESPN's  Adam Schefter ...", "image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/789/804/hi-res-941f9b36ed1e1dcba08d354ded642d99_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "title": "Redskins Rumors: Jack Del Rio Hired as DC;
