But John Krasinski\u2019s tightly wound horror movie also over $340 million worldwide, making it instant franchise material.\n\nThe first trailer for A Quiet Place Part II brings us back into a very silent world overrun by winged creatures who attack the slightest sound. Previously, a sparse teaser revealed the return of the Abbott family.\n\nThe sequel picks up shortly after the original, as the Abbott family rallies after the death of their father (Krasinski) and their discovery that high frequency noises hurt the fearsome creatures. Emily Blunt reprises her role as Evelyn Abbott, with Millicent Simonds as daughter Regan and Noah Jape as son Marcus. Joining the cast are Cillian Murphy (Peaky Blinders) and Djimon Hounsou (Guardians of the Galaxy) as other survivors who may or may not be friends.\n\nThough most plot details are being kept hush-hush, the film is said to focus on the Abbott children growing up. Originally set for a May release date, A Quiet Place Part II was bumped up to March 20, 2020.\n\nCheck out the poster below:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Petrana Radulovic", "Ryan Gilliam", "Julia Lee", "Charlie Hall", "Polygon Staff", "Jan"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Emily Blunt returns in A Quiet Place 2, the sequel to A Quiet Place.
