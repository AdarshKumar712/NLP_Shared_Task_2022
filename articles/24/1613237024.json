And who can resist a side of gooey mac and cheese?\n\nThe former royal chef divulged that the princes also enjoyed the chicken and mac and cheese with shucked corn, but when their nanny was in the house, the chicken had to be accompanied by broccoli. And the trade-off was that Harry and William had to eat a floret of broccoli for every piece of chicken they gobbled up!\n\n\"William and Harry loved this [the crispy chicken and mac and cheese] with shucked corn, but when Nanny was in the house...\" Darren said, before emphatically shaking his head and saying, \"she insisted that the boys must always eat their greens. And so, she insisted that it was broccoli all the time.\"\n\n\"The boys, I guess like any boys, weren't huge fans of broccoli, but what she said was 'When you do the broccoli I want you to have one piece of broccoli with each piece of chicken,'\" he continued.\n\n\"So, the boys had to have the broccoli if they wanted to have the chicken.\"\n\nAnd they were growing boys with big appetites, which meant they likely had more than one piece of chicken \u2013 and in turn, more broccoli.\n\n\"And of course the boys were big eaters. Two, three, sometimes four pieces [of chicken], that meant they got the broccoli,\" Darren continued.\n\nAnd nanny really made sure the young royals got as much of their greens as possible.\n\n\"I remember nanny coming out of the dining room afterwards,\" Darren reminisced. \"And she said, 'Well they ate their broccoli. Next time you do it, can you do bigger florets of broccoli, please?' Winked at me and walked out!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have a feeling some parents will be trying the clever hack on the picky eaters in their households next!\n\nMORE: Darren McGrady reveals what Prince William and Prince Harry liked to do for Princess Diana on Mother's Day\n\nDarren recently chatted with HELLO!
