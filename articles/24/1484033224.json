And with that, he is confident will have a good and memorable year in 2020.While companies will get help to raise their productivity and build new capabilities, workers, especially mid-career PMETs - professionals, managers, executives and technicians - will be given a hand to retrain, find new jobs and stay employable, he added.The social safety nets that protect the poor, elderly and vulnerable will be improved, and \"we will help households with their cost of living\", the Prime Minister said in a message recorded at the Bicentennial Experience exhibition in Fort Canning.The showcase of important moments in Singapore's history was a key event to commemorate the country's Bicentennial year, which Lee said provided a vivid reminder of how much the island has changed over the centuries, and how far the Republic has come.\"Recounting this history has enhanced our collective consciousness of the past, strengthened our sense of togetherness in the present, and boosted our confidence in a shared future,\" he said.\"In Singapore, the aim is to build a fair and just society, where growth and prosperity benefits everyone, and the human spirit can flourish.\" - Asian News Network", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Singapore", "Outlook", "2020", "New Year Message", "Lee"], "tags": ["Singapore"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "SINGAPORE: Singapore has benefited enormously from globalisation and it must resist the temptation to  be otherwise, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/theme_metro/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"ROBOTS": "index,follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "SINGAPORE: Singapore has benefited enormously from globalisation and it must resist the temptation to  be otherwise, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said.", "keywords": "Singapore,Outlook,2020,New Year Message,Lee", "cXenseParse": {"smg-keywords": "Lee", "author": "The Star Online", "pageclass": "article", "smg-accesstype": "metered", "recs": {"publishtime": "2020-01-01T23:22:00+0800"}, "articleid": 180658, "smg-contenttype": "Article", "kicker_name": "Singapore", "kicker_url": "/tag/singapore"}, "pageType": "article", "url": "https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2020/01/01/lee-globalisation-will-help-singapore-to-succeed-in-2020", "datePublished": "2020-01-01 23:22:00", "dateModified": "2020-01-01 23:44:48", "inLanguage": "en", "cxenseRandom": "k4vop7uji4ge2jdym4ak", "page_type": "Article", "content_type": "Article", "content_id": 180658, "content_title": "Lee: Globalisation will help Singapore to succeed in 2020", "content_category": "News/Regional", "content_author": "NA", "content_sp": "NA", "content_byline": "NA", "content_agency": "NA", "content_language": "English", "content_date": "2020-01-01", "content_tags": "Singapore,Outlook,2020,New Year Message,Lee", "content_tier": "Metered", "content_length": "Short", "parsely-metadata": "{\"guid\": \"180658\", \"byline\": \"NA\", \"summary\": \"SINGAPORE: Singapore has benefited enormously from globalisation and it must resist the temptation to  be otherwise, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said.\", \"image_url\" :\"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/01/01/466513.jpg\",\"contain_video\": false,\"is_premium\": false,\"is_print\": false,\"access_type\": \"metered\" ,\"kicker_name\": \"Singapore\",\"kicker_url\": \"/tag/singapore\" }", "thumbnailUrl": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/01/01/466513.jpg", "article": {"modified_time": "2020-01-01T23:44:48.000Z", "published_time": "2020-01-01T23:22:00.000Z", "section": "News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 121120175250633}, "og": {"url": "https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2020/01/01/lee-globalisation-will-help-singapore-to-succeed-in-2020", "title": "Lee: Globalisation will help Singapore to succeed in 2020", "description": "SINGAPORE: Singapore has benefited enormously from globalisation and it must resist the temptation to  be otherwise, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said.", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "The Star Online", "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/01/01/466513.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lee: Globalisation will help Singapore to succeed in 2020", "description": "SINGAPORE: Singapore has benefited enormously from globalisation and it must resist the temptation to  be otherwise, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said.", "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/01/01/466513.jpg"}, "article_section_name": "News", "csrf-token": "Vki0AEQj9WjZ2jH0zCWdpfYKECwee7EENiDox1z0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=428184176"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2020/01/01/lee-globalisation-will-help-singapore-to-succeed-in-2020"}
