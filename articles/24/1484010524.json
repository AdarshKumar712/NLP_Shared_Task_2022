There is no drop, but it\u2019s here,\u201d he apologetically told reporters Monday at the Fulton government center, where the giant peach hangs in the atrium.\n\nIf this peach represents a ball dropped in Atlanta \u2013 it\u2019s getting picked up a few miles up the road in Cobb County. That\u2019s where the Battery Atlanta expects a raucous new year celebration that should include a hearty measure of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nThink back to 2013, when Atlanta\u2019s Turner Field unexpectedly lost its flagship tenant \u2013 after the Atlanta Braves had been unable or unwilling to make a deal to stay in the city. Like some of this year\u2019s New Year\u2019s revelers, the Braves moved on to Cobb County \u2013 which built the team\u2019s stadium alongside the Battery.\n\nState Rep. Eric Allen (D-Vinings) said Cobb County\u2019s Battery stands to gain from the Peach Drop void.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the best fireworks shows in the southeast for New Year\u2019s. A lot of energy, lot of live music. I think it\u2019s definitely gaining in momentum,\u201d Allen said.\n\nThe irony is that the former Turner Field property, now owned by Georgia State University, is the centerpiece of the kind of neighborhood development that Braves had sought downtown \u2013 new homes under construction, new restaurants and businesses already open nearby \u2013 minus the Atlanta baseball team.\n\nLosing the Braves was a black eye for Atlanta. Robb Pitts thinks the Peach Drop can be salvaged for next year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s grown through the years and it\u2019s important,\u201d Pitts said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be something bigger and better in the future.\u201d\n\nPitts thinks the Peach Drop will return next year with help from Atlanta\u2019s business community. Rep. Allen thinks there\u2019s room for both new year\u2019s celebrations \u2013 maybe next year.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 17:35:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "There won\u2019t be a Peach Drop at the Battery Atlanta, but there will be fireworks and festivities.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/assets/favicons/WXIA.png?ver=2.6.2.1", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#d81f32", "category": "news", "og": {"url": "https://www.11alive.com/article/news/battery-new-year/85-78801751-afda-419c-a172-468d07960426", "title": "Cobb cashes in on Atlanta's dropped Peach Drop", "description": "There won\u2019t be a Peach Drop at the Battery Atlanta, but there will be fireworks and festivities.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/6fd58ad1-3ab0-4892-bc3e-b0aec79a5267/6fd58ad1-3ab0-4892-bc3e-b0aec79a5267_1140x641.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "5:35 PM EST December 31, 2019"}, "site_name": "11Alive.com", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "section": "11alive,news,politics,entertainment,events"}, "twitter": {"title": "Cobb cashes in on Atlanta's dropped Peach Drop", "image": "https://media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/6fd58ad1-3ab0-4892-bc3e-b0aec79a5267/6fd58ad1-3ab0-4892-bc3e-b0aec79a5267_1140x641.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "11AliveNews", "description": "There won\u2019t be a Peach Drop at the Battery Atlanta, but there will be fireworks and festivities.", "domain": "www.11alive.com"}, "viewport": "width=1170", "site": "11alive.com", "description": "There won\u2019t be a Peach Drop at the Battery Atlanta, but there will be fireworks and festivities.", "fb": {"app_id": 2077762549125574}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.11alive.com/article/news/battery-new-year/85-78801751-afda-419c-a172-468d07960426"}
