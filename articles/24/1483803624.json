The victim partially rolled down the window and the man then pointed a pistol at his head and ordered the victim to get out of the vehicle, court documents say.\n\nTwo other men wearing ski masks showed up and they forced Anthony in the backseat of the Jeep.\n\nThey drove Anthony to an ATM and forced him to take out money. They then drove him to the area of 71st Avenue and Greenway Road and told him to get out of the Jeep and walk away backward.\n\nRELATED: Woman charged with multiple felonies after trying to pepper spray Gilbert police officer\n\nAnthony told investigators that's when one of the men pointed the gun at him and he turned around and ran. He ran east towards 71st Avenue.\n\nHe was shot in the lower back as he was running away, court documents allege. Anthony told police he believes shot toward him six to eight times.\n\nAnthony ran to nearby homes looking for help. A person called 911 and Anthony was taken to the hospital where he underwent emergency surgery, police reported.\n\nRELATED: 'A cold, hard, callous act': Man in wheelchair says he was robbed of his rent money\n\nInvestigators say the suspects took Anthony's phone and the Jeep. Police were able to trace his phone and found the Jeep parked in front of a home near Carver Drive and 21st Street.\n\nPolice say the three suspects were still inside the Jeep when they arrived. The suspects sped away through the neighborhood until they eventually stopped near 20th Street and E. Euclid Avenue.\n\nPolice arrested Roderick Jabri Smith, 18, and two juveniles.\n\nSmith allegedly admitted to pointing the gun at the victim and forcing him to withdraw $300 to $600 from an ATM.\n\nSmith reportedly told investigators they drove around with the victim and smoked weed.\n\nSmith claims he stayed in the Jeep when the victim was told to get out. He says the other two suspects got out with the victim. That's when he says he heard several gunshots, according to court documents.\n\nRELATED: How can you protect yourself in dangerous rideshare situations?\n\nSmith is a convicted felon and is on probation. His bond was set at $75,000. He was ordered to not have any contact with his co-defendants.\n\nHe will be back in court on January 6.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Author", "Published", "Am Mst December", "Updated", "Pm Mst December"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 17:29:09 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Police say the Ohio State fan was in town for the Fiesta Bowl that was played on Saturday.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/content/favicon/KPNX.png?version=3.22.6", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1170", "site": "12news.com", "fb": {"app_id": 139810620033253}, "og": {"site_name": "KPNX", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.12news.com/article/news/crime/pd-man-kidnapped-robbed-and-shot-in-phoenix/75-5e12cf3d-8d3a-417e-bad3-ad69e4e2461c", "title": "3 arrested after Fiesta Bowl fan kidnapped, robbed and shot, Phoenix police say", "description": "Police say the Ohio State fan was in town for the Fiesta Bowl that was played on Saturday.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.12news.com/assets/KPNX/images/f16e8193-43e8-4f5d-9d7d-9fae7faae51c/f16e8193-43e8-4f5d-9d7d-9fae7faae51c_1140x641.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "12/31/2019 5:29:09 PM"}}, "description": "Police say the Ohio State fan was in town for the Fiesta Bowl that was played on Saturday.", "category": "news", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"title": "3 arrested after Fiesta Bowl fan kidnapped, robbed and shot, Phoenix police say", "image": {"src": "https://media.12news.com/assets/KPNX/images/f16e8193-43e8-4f5d-9d7d-9fae7faae51c/f16e8193-43e8-4f5d-9d7d-9fae7faae51c_360x203.jpg"}, "card": "summary", "site": "12News", "description": "Police say the Ohio State fan was in town for the Fiesta Bowl that was played on Saturday.", "domain": "www.12news.com"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.12news.com/article/news/crime/pd-man-kidnapped-robbed-and-shot-in-phoenix/75-5e12cf3d-8d3a-417e-bad3-ad69e4e2461c"}
