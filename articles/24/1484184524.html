He served in the position with the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/jacksonville-jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> for nine seasons from 2003 through 2011, when he was fired after Week 12. He was also the head coach of the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/oakland-raiders">Oakland Raiders</a> from 2015 through 2017.</span></p><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-17006701" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="1" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_01" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div><p><span>The 56-year-old finished with a 93-94 record and never advanced past the divisional round of the playoffs as a head coach, but he did as a defensive assistant.</span></p><p><span>He was the linebackers coach for the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> from 1999 through 2001, the defensive coordinator for the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/carolina-panthers">Carolina Panthers</a> in 2002 and the defensive coordinator for the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/denver-broncos">Denver Broncos</a> from 2012 through 2014.</span></p><p><span>Baltimore won a Super Bowl during his tenure with Ray Lewis leading his linebackers unit, and Denver reached a Super Bowl but lost. In four seasons as a defensive coordinator, Del Rio directed groups that finished in the top three in the league in yards allowed three times.</span></p><p><span>What's more, the 2000 Ravens defense he was involved with allowed three, 10, three and seven points (on a kickoff return and the point after) in four playoff games before lifting the Lombardi Trophy.</span></p><p><span>The Redskins now have a coach with championship pedigree and a track record of success who brings name recognition to that side of the ball.</span></p><p><span>Del Rio will take the reins of a unit that ranked 27th in total defense and 27th in points allowed under Greg Manusky in 2019.</span></p><p><span>While there is work to be done, Del Rio will have plenty of talent, including safety Landon Collins and a strong line that features Jonathan Allen, Matt Ioannidis and Montez Sweat.</span></p><p><span>The Redskins also own the No. 2 overall pick in the 2020 <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/nfl">NFL</a> draft, which they could use to select Ohio State defensive end Chase Young.</span></p><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-53735041" class="br-ad-lazy"
