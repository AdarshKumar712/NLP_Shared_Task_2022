(Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images) (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)\n\nMathew Barzal is the only representative for the New York Islanders at this year's NHL All-Star Game. If anyone else could join him who would you send?\n\nLike most years, the New York Islanders will have a single representative going to the NHL All-Star game. This year, Mathew Barzal is the Islanders lone ambassador. I know, what a surprise! (Note the heavy sarcasm.)\n\nOf course, Barzal going to be the Islanders representative at the NHL All-Star Game. He leads the team in goals, assists, and points. He's the star of the team and the face of the franchise. He's also dynamic at the 3on3 format of the All-Star game.\n\nLast year, in his first trip to the All-Star festivities, Barzal was the talk of the town. Lining up with Sidney Crosby and Kris Letang, Barzal put up five points in the championship game alone.\n\nAfter winning last year's 3on3 tournament, Crosby raved about the Islanders youngster and his skill at 3on3 (and 5on5):\n\n\"The way he holds onto the puck, the way he skates, 3-on-3, I mean, I don't know if there is anyone better when it comes to holding onto it,\" Crosby said. \"The way he can just beat you 1-on-1, beat you with his speed, hold onto it, you know, watching him out there against the best, and I don't see anyone that really beats him in that category.\n\nAgain, it makes sense that Barzal is going. He deserves to go.\n\nBut what about other players on the roster? Who else might have deserved to go to the All-Star Game?\n\nI'm stopping short of calling this a snub list because I understand why some of the names I've come up with didn't end up on the final roster. But when I look at the goalies who were selected to the Metro's All-Star team, and that neither one of them are from the New York Islanders, it's clear there's at least one snub.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Mathew Barzal is the only representative for the New York Islanders at this year's NHL All-Star Game.
