Originally championed by the Guarani, an ancient people indigenous to the South American rainforests, the history of Yerba Mate can be traced back many centuries and today the delicious and versatile drink continues to be enjoyed across the globe, with Argentina as the world's leading producer.\n\nArgentina cultivates the tree with production practices that are one hundred percent natural. Within Argentina, the plant is cultivated in the Misiones Province, where the trees thrive in the region's humid, subtropical climate, growing to approximately 40-50 ft. tall before being harvested. Yerba Mate leaves are similar to wine in their aging process, which can take anywhere from one month to three years to age depending on the variety. From germination to packaging, it takes approximately five years to harvest just one crop of yerba mate.\n\nFor more information about Argentine Yerba Mate, the Coffee Swap challenge, inspiration and recipes, visit SayYestoMate.com and follow along the #YesToYerbaMate conversation on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n1 Source: Kerry Group\n\nAbout National Institution of Argentine Yerba Mate\n\nThe National Institution of Argentine Yerba Mate is a national organization focused on promoting awareness for Argentine Yerba Mate and its growers.
