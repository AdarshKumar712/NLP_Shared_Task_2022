(NASDAQ: XAIR), a clinical-stage medical device and biopharmaceutical company focused on developing inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) for the treatment of patients with respiratory conditions, serious lung infections , including those suffering from COVID-19, and pulmonary hypertension, as well as gaseous NO for the treatment of solid tumors, today announced that the Company has drawn $5 million from its previously announced $25 million line of credit to provide the resources to more rapidly move the LungFit\u2122 BRO COVID-19 program forward.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile we await feedback from BARDA (a division of HHS) and other US and international agencies, this money allows us to accelerate the anticipated COVID-19 clinical study start,\u201d said Steve Lisi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Beyond Air. \u201cWhile we anticipate receiving grants on an emergency basis, we have decided that there is an urgent need to commence the study as soon as possible pending IDE approval from FDA.\u201d\n\nAbout Beyond Air, Inc.\n\nBeyond Air, Inc. is a clinical-stage medical device and biopharmaceutical company developing a revolutionary NO Generator and Delivery System, LungFit\u2122, that uses NO generated from ambient air to deliver precise amounts of NO to the lungs for the potential treatment of a variety of pulmonary diseases. The LungFit\u2122 can generate up to 400 ppm of NO for delivery either continuously or for a fixed amount of time and has the ability to either titrate dose on demand or maintain a constant dose. The Company is currently applying its therapeutic expertise to develop treatments for pulmonary hypertension in various settings, in addition to treatments for lower respiratory tract infections that are not effectively addressed with current standards of care. Beyond Air is currently advancing its revolutionary LungFit\u2122 in clinical trials for the treatment of bronchiolitis and severe lung infections such as nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), as well as for the potential treatment of COVID-19 patients. Additionally, Beyond Air is using ultra-high concentrations of NO with a proprietary delivery system to target certain solid tumors in the pre-clinical setting. For more information, visit www.beyondair.net .\n\nAbout Nitric Oxide (NO)\n\nNitric Oxide (NO) is a powerful molecule proven to play a critical role in a broad array of biological functions. In the airways, NO targets the vascular smooth muscle cells that surround the small resistance arteries in the lungs and is used in adult respiratory distress syndrome and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Additionally, NO is believed to play a key role in the innate immune system and in vitro studies suggest that NO possesses anti-microbial activity not only against common bacteria, including both gram-positive and gram-negative, but also against other diverse organisms, including mycobacteria, viruses, fungi, yeast and parasites, and has the potential to eliminate multi-drug resistant strains.\n\nAbout the LungFit\u2122 NO Generator and Delivery System*\n\nBeyond Air\u2019s NO Generator and Delivery System is a cylinder-free, phasic flow Nitric Oxide delivery system and has been designated as a medical device by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The ventilator compatible version of the device can generate NO from ambient air on demand for delivery to the lungs at concentrations ranging from 1 part per million (ppm) to 80 ppm. The LungFit\u2122 could potentially replace large, high-pressure NO cylinders providing significant advantages in the hospital setting, including greatly reducing inventory and storage requirements, improving overall safety with the elimination of NO 2 purging steps, and other benefits. The LungFit\u2122 can also deliver NO at concentrations above 80 ppm for which intended treatments are: bronchiolitis in the hospital setting, and chronic, refractory lung infections in the home setting. For the first time, Beyond Air intends to offer NO treatment in the home setting with the elimination of cylinders.\n\n* Beyond Air\u2019s LungFit\u2122 is not approved for commercial use and Beyond Air is not suggesting use over 80 ppm or use at home. Beyond Air\u2019s LungFit\u2122 is for investigational purposes only.\n\nAbout COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 first emerged in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. Those affected develop fever, cough, shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing. While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some can progress to pneumonia and multi-organ failure. The fatality rate is currently estimated at between 1% and 3%. Older adults and people who have serious chronic medical conditions are at an increased risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19. There is no specific treatment approved for COVID-19 and patients are managed with supportive care. NO may prove to be a treatment as the impact on the lung should result in bronchodilation, reduction in inflammation and inhibition of the viral replication process. As of March 17, 2020, more than 190,000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 7,500 deaths have been reported in more than 160 countries.\n\nAbout Bronchiolitis\n\nThe majority of hospital admissions of infants with bronchiolitis are caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is a common and highly transmissible virus that infects the respiratory tract of most children before their second birthday. While most infants with RSV present with minor respiratory symptoms, a small percentage develop serious lower airway infections, termed bronchiolitis, which can become life-threatening. The absence of treatment options for bronchiolitis limits the care of these sick infants to largely supportive measures. Beyond Air\u2019s system is designed to effectively deliver over 80 ppm NO, for which preliminary studies indicate may eliminate bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes from the lungs.\n\nForward-Looking Statement\n\nThis press release contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d concerning inhaled nitric-oxide and the Company\u2019s LungFit\u2122 product, including statements with regard to potential regulatory developments, the potential impact on patients and anticipated benefits associated with its use.
