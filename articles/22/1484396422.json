morning.\n\nAccording to information received, motorcar PNN 7976 driven by 22-year-old Seeram Ramdat was speeding when it collided with a utility pole, injuring the driver and two passengers.\n\nThe

and coming to a halt on a resident\u2019s bridge.\n\nThe two occupants, 32-year-old Keron Phillips and 45-year-old Ramnand Kishwar were removed from the wreck in semi-conscious states and rushed to

He was also taken to the Skeldon Hospital where he is admitted in a stable condition.\n\nThe News Room understands that the vehicle is owned by an elderly woman, and Ramdatt took it without her knowledge.\n\nPolice Commissioner Leslie James on Wednesday disclosed that there has been an 8% increase in road fatalities in 2018.\n\n( 0 ) ( 0 )", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 21:17:15 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "-", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.stlucianewsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b52fd3a5ff2ec82d5321ebe65f5cb805.ico.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "-", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Guyana: Three injured after car crashes into utility pole - St. Lucia News Online", "description": "-", "url": "https://www.stlucianewsonline.com/guyana-three-injured-after-car-crashes-into-utility-pole/", "site_name": "St. Lucia News Online", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.stlucianewsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/car-crash-guyana.jpeg", "secure_url": "https://www.stlucianewsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/car-crash-guyana.jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 736}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/stlucianewsonline/", "section": "Guyana News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T21:17:15-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 249337255435947}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.1", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "google-site-verification": "hQfSU6CLb02WzlZCeIklOwskMtnMGW-W6PMATIzzR3U"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.stlucianewsonline.com/guyana-three-injured-after-car-crashes-into-utility-pole/"}
