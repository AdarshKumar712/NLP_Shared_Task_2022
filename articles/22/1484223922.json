(WXMI/CNN) - Thursday was adoption day for a Michigan boy, but it was not just him and his new family celebrating. The child had his entire class cheering them on.\n\nBoy brings classmates to adoption ceremony (Source: CNN)\n\nThere is no doubt that 5-year-old Michael Orlando Clark Jr. will never forget this day. He was dressed to the nines and so excited he could hardly sit still as his adoption was just moments from being finalized.\n\nMichael wanted everyone to see it, so he invited his entire kindergarten class who waved hearts and cheered him on during the ceremony.\n\nAfter fostering for about a year, his parents Andrea Melvin and David Eaton knew they had found the right fit for their family.\n\n\u201cHe brings us a lot of joy. He's just so full of energy and so full of love. It's just been great for everybody,\u201d said Melvin.\n\nThere was no shortage of love all around them in the courtroom.\n\n\"It is a great tribute to Michael that he had so many of his classmates here and so many said he was their best friend too,\u201d Michigan Supreme Court Justice Stephen Markman said.\n\n\"Never have I experienced that before, and it was loads of fun. The kids were into it and supporting their best friend, and the family of Michael,\u201d said Judge Patricia Gardner.\n\nMichael already has everything he wants this holiday season:\n\n\u201cGiving a kid a permanent home, a forever family, is just the best gift you can give anybody,\u201d said Melvin.\n\n\u201cWe've been really fortunate and just hopefully other families get to enjoy similar moments,\u201d said Eaton.\n\nThirty-six kids were also adopted Thursday as part of the 23rd annual adoption day in Kent County.\n\nCopyright 2019 WXMI via CNN.
