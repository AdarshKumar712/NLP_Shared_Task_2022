We\u2019ll revisit the battle while we tell you more about the outcome.\n\nAugusta Circuit Superior Court Judge Ashley Wright approved a consent agreement that dissolves a trust established 100 years ago.\n\nThe land involves two properties - a 15.78-acre site on Johns Road called Pendleton Camp, and the 64-acre park and bird sanctuary. It used to be the sprawling estate of Henry B. and Elizabeth King. When their mansion burned in 1912, they moved to a cottage on the estate. Their plan was for their son, Pendleton, to rebuild the mansion when he returned from World War I.\n\nBut within weeks of returning to Augusta in 1919, Pendleton suffered a fatal brain aneurysm. Henry King later stipulated in his will that the land be set aside in a trust for two purposes: housing for World War I veterans and their families, and a park to honor his son \u201cin perpetuity.\u201d\n\nFor decades, a park foundation and a board of three trustees oversaw the property\u2019s improvements and preservation. But in 2018, two of those three trustees signed an agreement to sell the park to Winchester Homebuilders for $1.2 million to use to erect a 25-unit housing development.\n\nThe park foundation countered with a $500,000 lien - an estimated value of hundreds of volunteer hours spent improving the park.\n\nDistrict Attorney Natalie Paine also petitioned to stop the sale. Richmond County Probate Court Judge Harry B. James III granted the petition and installed members from both the park foundation and the preservation group Historic Augusta as new trustees.\n\nThe consent agreement Wright approved late last year turns all property and other assets over to the Pendleton King Park Foundation. She ruled that the best way to cleave closest to King\u2019s original wishes for the land would be to turn over the trusts' assets and property to the foundation.\n\n\u201cBut, Wright cautioned: \u2018Any such conveyance shall contain a restriction ... that the park property shall only be used as a public park for the benefit of the general public and the citizens of Richmond County,\u2019\u201d The Augusta Chronicle\u2019s Susan McCord reported last week.\n\nApart from developers hoping to capitalize on the land deal, we can\u2019t think of anyone else who would think that the park shouldn\u2019t stay as a park. As Paine said last August when filing her petition to save the park, she said simply: \u201cThis is a good thing.\u201d\n\nIt certainly is. If you haven\u2019t yet visited the park it\u2019s your own fault. Not only does it contain a bird sanctuary, but visitors also can stroll the wetland boardwalks, enjoy a picturesque waterfall and even let their pets enjoy an onsite dog park.\n\nIf you need a quiet spot to contemplate how the rest of 2020 is going to play out, we recommend Pendleton King Park. it won\u2019t make problems vanish, but it should deservedly keep you away from your computer keyboard for a while.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Augusta Chronicle Editorial Staff"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "What an encouraging way to help ring in the new year - with treasured land spared from unwanted development, and justice being served.Pendleton King Park has been saved.
