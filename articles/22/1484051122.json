That was done in Singapore, and I think he\u2019s a man of his word, so we\u2019re going to find out.\u201d\n\nMr Trump also said he would be happy to have a trial in the US Senate following his impeachment by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. \u201cI don\u2019t really care. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned I\u2019d be very happy with a trial because we did nothing wrong. The impeachment \u2013 I call it impeachment light,\u201d he added, predicting any Senate trial would \u201cgo very easy\u201d.\n\nThe president suggested he would win the 2020 election comfortably if the media treated him differently. \u201cIf you\u2019re honourable I\u2019m going to win the election by a lot. If you\u2019re not honourable I\u2019m just going to win the election by a little. So I\u2019d rather have you be honourable.\u201d\n\nMr Trump also addressed the attack on the US embassy in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, having earlier said he held Iran responsible.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a man of his word,\u201d Trump says of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pic.twitter.com/bYQLXeBYPA \u2014 QuickTake by Bloomberg (@QuickTake) January 1, 2020\n\nWashington drafted in Apache attack helicopters and scores of US Marines to reinforce the embassy compound after storming of the site by Iraqi militia members and their supporters.\n\n\u201cWe had some great warriors come in,\u201d said Mr Trump. \u201cThis will not be a Benghazi \u2026 this will never, ever be a Benghazi,\u201d he added, referring to the deadly attack on a US diplomatic compound in Libya in 2012.\n\nThe president has deployed 750 US soldiers to the Middle East, as about 3,000 more are prepared for possible deployment in the next several days.\n\nMr Trump also said the federal government will soon announce a new strategy to tackle underage vaping, promising. He was vague about what the plan would entail, but suggested \u201ccertain flavours\u201d in cartridge-based e-cigarettes would be taken off the market \u201cfor a period of time\u201d.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Food and Drug Administration would ban the sale of most flavoured e-cigarettes.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump follows Iran threat with bizarre tweet about mixed martial arts\n\nKim Jong-un threatens \u2018new strategic weapon\u2019 and rails against the US\n\nTrump threatens Iran over embassy attack in furious tweet", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["vaping", "Baghdad", "Kim Jong-un", "denuclearisation", "impeachment", "Donald Trump"], "authors": ["Adam Forrest"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 11:00:06 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Donald Trump has claimed he \u201clikes\u201d North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he hoped the North Korean leader would keep his word by upholding a denuclearisation agreement.The US president responded to the supreme leader\u2019s latest claim Pyongyang would continue developing nuclear programmes and introduce", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Donald Trump has claimed he \u201clikes\u201d North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he hoped the North Korean leader would keep his word by upholding a denuclearisation agreement.The US president responded to the supreme leader\u2019s latest claim Pyongyang would continue developing nuclear programmes and introduce", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.7RkisvpX2nPQ5zrJ3zQxQ--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/7ccbcf91bc12a684b672e6434c9741ad", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.7RkisvpX2nPQ5zrJ3zQxQ--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/7ccbcf91bc12a684b672e6434c9741ad"}, "title": "Trump insists Kim Jong-un is a \u2018man of his word\u2019 despite North Korea ramping up nuclear programme"}, "application-name": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Kim Jong-un, North Korean, strategic weapon", "googlebot": "noindex", "bingbot": "noindex", "robots": "noindex", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=4c19082f-02e0-3025-a738-a29aafe6abd3&src=web", "description": "Donald Trump has claimed he \u201clikes\u201d North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he hoped the North Korean leader would keep his word by upholding a denuclearisation agreement.The US president responded to the supreme leader\u2019s latest claim Pyongyang would continue developing nuclear programmes and introduce", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.7RkisvpX2nPQ5zrJ3zQxQ--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/7ccbcf91bc12a684b672e6434c9741ad", "description": "Donald Trump has claimed he \u201clikes\u201d North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he hoped the North Korean leader would keep his word by upholding a denuclearisation agreement.The US president responded to the supreme leader\u2019s latest claim Pyongyang would continue developing nuclear programmes and introduce", "title": "Trump insists Kim Jong-un is a \u2018man of his word\u2019 despite North Korea ramping up nuclear programme", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/trump-insists-kim-jong-un-110006370.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 338028696036, "app_id": 458584288257241}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=4c19082f-02e0-3025-a738-a29aafe6abd3&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=4c19082f-02e0-3025-a738-a29aafe6abd3&src=web"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://news.yahoo.com/trump-insists-kim-jong-un-110006370.html"}
