protests against the amended citizenship law in the country. The university was to reopen on 6 January.\n\nAccording to an AMU notice, the decision to extend the vacations again was taken after a meeting chaired by Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor on Wednesday. A detailed schedule for the reopening of the university \"in a phased manner\" will be notified after the review of the situation.\n\nOn 15 December night, the university had announced an extended winter break following violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) on the campus.\n\nOver 60 people, including 40 students, AMU security staff and policemen, were injured in the violence. At least four students who received serious injuries are still being treated.\n\nA number of injured students had alleged that police and the Rapid Action Police (RAF) indulged in excesses. Police have booked 56 persons, including a number of students, for holding a protest which later turned violent.\n\nOn December 24, nine days after the violence, the RAF filed a separate FIR in which around 1,000 unidentified students were booked for violence.\n\nStudents have also formed a coordination committee for continuing their peaceful protest against the CAA on the campus.\n\nFind latest and upcoming tech gadgets online on Tech2 Gadgets.
