The trio, who stunned everyone when they returned in 2019 with their single \u201cSucker\u201d and went on to tour some of their new tunes from their album Happiness Begins, took to the stage in the first hours of 2020 to a rousing audience.\n\nThe three siblings were in a great mood as they swayed their hips and interacted with the audience while singing their hit songs \u201cOnly Human\u201d and \u201cSucker\u201d. They looked handsome in sparkly black outfits as they showed off their incredible vocals and guitar skills. At some points, they even asked the excited crowd to sing along with them and you can bet they received an awesome response!\n\nOf course, the brothers were joined by a slew of other incredibly talented performers throughout the night who have been ringing in 2020 in style! Along with the Jo Bros, Post Malone, BTX, Paula Abdul, and Kelsea Ballerini, among many others all made appearances or are due to perform throughout the telecast. For now, however, the spotlight wholly rests on the fun and talent of the Jonas Brothers, who had an incredible 2019 and are poised for a new, exciting chapter in 2020!\n\nJust when it seemed the members of the Jonas Brothers had gone their separate ways, they shocked their fans with the release of their song \u201cSucker\u201d on March 1, 2019. What\u2019s more, the music video for the track became an internet sensation, as the accompanying visual featured each Jo Bro\u2019s wife \u2014 Sophie Turner, Priyanka Chopra and Danielle Jonas.\n\n\ud83d\udcf9 The Jonas Brothers performing \u201cOnly Human\u201d at Atlantis Bahamas in The Bahamas.

Apart from going out on tour, they have also been featured in a number of performances from the MTV VMAs, The American Music Awards (where the brothers\u2019 performance was brought in live by satellite), and even stopped at Rockefeller center in May as the musical guest for Saturday Night Live! Now that the Jo Bros have rung in the new year, fans cannot wait to see what\u2019s in store for 2020!", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Diet", "Makeover", "Jonas Brothers", "Celeb Galleries", "New Year's Eve", "Portrait Series", "Bonnie Says", "Fitness", "Oscar Contenders"], "authors": ["Julia Teti Erin Silvia", "Julia Teti", "Erin Silvia"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Jonas Brothers rang in the New Year with a slew of fans singing along to their hits during their lively performance moments into 2020.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"description": "Jonas Brothers rang in the New Year with a slew of fans singing along to their hits during their lively performance moments into 2020.", "news_keywords": "Joe Jonas, Jonas Brothers, Kevin Jonas, New Year's Eve, Nick Jonas", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jonas Brothers Ring In 2020 With Energetic Performance On \u2018Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/01/01/jonas-brothers-new-years-eve-2020-performance-photos/", "description": "Nick, Joe and Kevin Jonas rang in the new year with some rockin\u2019 tunes, as they performed some of their hits for a crowd in Miami, FL in the first moments of 2020!", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/jonas-brothers-ring-in-2020-abc-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 349, "alt": "Jonas Brothers"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T05:21:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T05:31:17+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "text": {"title": "Jonas Brothers Ring In 2020 With Energetic Performance On \u2018Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve\u2019"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/jonas-brothers-ring-in-2020-abc-ftr.jpg?w=620", "alt": "Jonas Brothers"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jonas Brothers Ring In 2020 With Energetic Performance On \u2018Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve\u2019", "description": "Jonas Brothers rang in the New Year with a slew of fans singing along to their hits during their lively performance moments into 2020."}, "author": "Julia Teti,Erin Silvia", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://hollywoodlife.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=16", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/01/01/jonas-brothers-new-years-eve-2020-performance-photos/"}
