The goal of the program is to support schools who commit to using technology to transform teaching and learning.\n\nTechnology is an enabler. It allows to break down barriers as it helps teachers to develop new, immersive and inclusive learning experiences. As a result, more and more schools that have integrated technology in their approach to teaching and learning are finding how it helps students to boost their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, learn anytime, anywhere and improve academic results.\n\nAcer for Education Innovative School Program is a tribute to those schools that have embraced technology as a means to give students new personalized and engaging ways to learn the abilities they will need to succeed in school and life. The program is targeted to all EMEA schools that are taking the path of digital transformation. The following schools are a part of the program; Al Sahwa School in Oman, New English School and The English Academy in Kuwait and lastly Abu Dhabi Grammar School, British School in Khubairat in the UAE.\n\nWhether they are just starting or are pioneers, these schools are committed to helping each student to reach their potential and follow their dreams through innovation and technology.\n\nSchools enrolled in Acer Innovative School program can enjoy several benefits:\n\nTeachers from Acer Innovative Schools are invited to attend the EMEA Teachers Advisory Council, where they can meet with peers, listen to education experts and participate in training sessions\n\nSchools can participate in webinars covering a range of topics to keep up-to-date with the latest trends and tools. Topics include mini-training on Windows and Chrome platforms and their apps.\n\nAcer Innovative Schools can share their stories, achievements or experiences on Acer for Education\u2019s blog and become a source of inspiration for other schools. What\u2019s more, schools receive a monthly newsletter where they can find updates on technological contents, alliance partner news, demo program and other initiatives.\n\nEach Acer Innovative Schools receives two demo devices per year, so teachers and students are kept abreast of the latest technological innovations and can find out how they can help them achieve more.\n\nAcer Project Humanity\n\nAcer Innovative Schools are also encouraged to join the Acer Project Humanity, a new global initiative by Acer to bring humanity at the centre of our activities and give back to communities and the environment.\n\nFor this reason, early in October Acer for Education launched a contest among Acer Innovative Schools across Europe, Middle East and Africa to encourage students to submit projects evaluated based on number of green actions and originality among other criteria. What\u2019s more, winning schools were able to give a helping hand by supporting the learning path of a Charity Education Organization of their choice, giving them their prize of 10 Acer devices each.\n\nOne such school that took this to the next level was the New English School in Kuwait who have a long-standing commitment to raising awareness of environmental concerns. Keeping the grounds litter-free, reducing usage of materials that just end up in a landfill, reusing materials where possible and recycling what can be economically processed are some of the activities students were involved with. The New English School partnered with the charity organization Direct Aid and will donate their prizes to underprivileged students in Africa.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Innovative School Program", "Acer for Education", "Acer"], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 06:03:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-Biz-Icon-01-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "http://www.bizbahrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Learn.jpg", "width": 741, "height": 486}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Acer for Education renews the Innovative School Program for 2020 - bizbahrain", "description": "Acer for Education renews the Innovative School Program for 2020, to support schools in their path towards digital transformation.
