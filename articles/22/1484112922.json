Senior counsel Amit Desai, appearing for Mallya, said the court has ordered lifting of attachment of assets, which are UBHL shares.\n\nMallya, 65, a former one-term Rajya Sabha Member, who had launched the high-profile Kingfisher Airlines, slipped out of the country in March 2016 and is now residing in London.\n\nHe was arrested by the UK Police in April 2017, following which in December 2018, a UK court ordered his extradition to India which he has contested. The matter is still pending.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Mumbai", "SBI", "vijay mallya"], "tags": ["SBI", "Mumbai", "vijay mallya"], "authors": ["India.Com Business Desk"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 23:06:26 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The development comes after the consortium filed an application in the special court seeking the release of Mallya's assets which could be disposed off to recover a part of the loans extended to him.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/76x761.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": "111369852268642,202151043156155,866415226763838,775670142542664", "app_id": 178196885542208}, "article": {"published": "2020-01-01T23:06:26+05:30", "modified": "2020-01-01T23:06:26+05:30", "published_time": "2020-01-01T23:06:26+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T23:06:26+05:30", "author": "https://www.india.com/author/businessdesk/"}, "description": "The development comes after the consortium filed an application in the special court seeking the release of Mallya's assets which could be disposed off to recover a part of the loans extended to him.", "keywords": "Mumbai,SBI,vijay mallya", "news_keywords": "Mumbai,SBI,vijay mallya", "robots": "index,follow", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Mumbai Court Allows Banks to Utilise Vijay Mallya's Movable Assets to Recover Debt", "description": "The development comes after the consortium filed an application in the special court seeking the release of Mallya's assets which could be disposed off to recover a part of the loans extended to him.", "url": "https://www.india.com/business/mumbai-court-allows-banks-to-utilise-vijay-mallyas-movable-assets-to-recover-debt-3896127/", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Vijay-Mallya.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 700, "height": 415}, "site_name": "India.com"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@indiacom"}, "author": "India.com Business Desk", "msvalidate.01": "FD7837E94C694BA88985E0E95C05B284"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.india.com/business/mumbai-court-allows-banks-to-utilise-vijay-mallyas-movable-assets-to-recover-debt-3896127/"}
