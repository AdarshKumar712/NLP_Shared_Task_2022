Join in the conversation using #wef20, tag us in your posts and find out more about the event themes here:https://t.co/KLAefTD23C \u2014 World Economic Forum (@wef) January 20, 2020\n\nNaturally there will be a gratuitous amount of climate change alarmism, and who better to present that message than Greta Thunberg. The WEF has provided a preview of what many attendees who have private jets waiting at the nearby airport can expect to hear:\n\nThe climate change alarmists in attendance can discuss Thunberg\u2019s ideas on their jet rides back home.\n\nIt is ridiculous that @wef is even entertaining this. The fossil fuel economy isn't going anywhere in the near future. There is no viable alternative, regardless of how much you wish for it. \u2014 Morgan Rodwell (@TechnicalBard) January 21, 2020\n\nMaybe those serious about the issue should at least schedule a teleconference next year instead of having everybody fly in from all parts of the world for another lecture about how burning fossil fuels is destroying the planet.\n\n2 things I like about Davos: 1. Climate hypocrites flying 1,500 private jets to get there. 2. Climate bedwetters protesting global warming in the snow \u2014 which they predicted wouldn't be there. https://t.co/U9iPycBYCF \u2014 Steve Milloy (@JunkScience) January 20, 2020\n\nAnd yet they never seem to see the irony or hypocrisy.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["#WEF", "Climate change", "Davos", "global warming", "Greta Thunberg"], "tags": ["#WEF", "global warming", "Climate change", "Greta Thunberg", "Davos"], "authors": ["Doug P.", "Posted At Pm On January"], "publish_date": "Mon Jan 20 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "\"It is ridiculous that...\"", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://twitchy.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "WEF previews Greta Thunberg's challenge to world leaders in Davos (to take effect AFTER they all fly home from Switzerland of course)", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/mediumtile.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/widetile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/largetile.png", "description": "\"It is ridiculous that...\"", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "WEF previews Greta Thunberg's challenge to world leaders in Davos (to take effect AFTER they all fly home from Switzerland of course)", "description": "\"It is ridiculous that...\"", "url": "https://twitchy.com/dougp-3137/2020/01/20/wef-previews-greta-thunbergs-challenge-to-world-leaders-in-davos-to-take-effect-after-they-all-fly-home-from-switzerland-of-course/", "site_name": "twitchy.com", "image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Thunberg_AP.png"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TeamTwitchy/", "tag": "Greta Thunberg", "section": "Media", "published_time": "2020-01-20T23:07:20-05:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\"It is ridiculous that...\"", "title": "WEF previews Greta Thunberg's challenge to world leaders in Davos (to take effect AFTER they all fly home from Switzerland of course)", "site": "@TwitchyTeam", "domain": "twitchy.com", "image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Thunberg_AP.png", "creator": "@ThePowersThatBe"}, "fb": {"pages": "41632789656,103971336305218,319569361390023,106547192707583,124538510989702,283971595408,15418366158,153162531376557,127519040661256,123834811060739,305174559545115,321502821264274,413465452078762,492802317512753,140705212665688,116757565026850,114013445328868"}, "keywords": "#WEF, Climate change, Davos, global warming, Greta Thunberg", "author": "Doug P."}, "canonical_link": "https://twitchy.com/dougp-3137/2020/01/20/wef-previews-greta-thunbergs-challenge-to-world-leaders-in-davos-to-take-effect-after-they-all-fly-home-from-switzerland-of-course/"}
