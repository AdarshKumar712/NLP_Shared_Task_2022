Also remind children that drug use, vaping and other activities also can cause impairment.\n\n\n\nFast Facts\n\n\n\nConsider these alarming facts about drunk driving, according to SAMHSA:\n\n\n\n\u00bb One in every four teen car crashes involves an underage drinking driver.\n\n\n\n\u00bb About 800 people are injured in a drunk driving crash every day.\n\n\n\n\u00bb One person dies every 50 minutes as a result of an impaired crash.\n\n\n\n\u00bb Thirteen percent of weekend nighttime drivers have marijuana in their system.\n\n\n\n\u00bb Marijuana users are about 25% more likely to be involved in a crash than a driver with no evidence of marijuana use.\n\n\n\nKeeping Kids Safe\n\n\n\nTalk to your children, SAMHSA says, early and often. Lay down rules and expectations clearly. Discuss impaired driving whenever your child borrows the car, at dinner, when a child leaves with a friend, running errands, at the grocery store. Everywhere. All the time.\n\n\n\nMost importantly, help them build an exit plan. Your child may not know what to do if an impaired person they would normally trust offers them a ride. Let them know it\u2019s OK to say no, and help them think of ways they can find a safe ride home, including:\n\n\n\n\u00bb Calling a taxi or a rideshare service;\n\n\n\n\u00bb Calling a sober person; or\n\n\n\n\u00bb Staying the night where they are.\n\n\n\nAlso talk to them about how to convince an impaired person not to drive. And remember to model good behavior. If you drink, never drink and drive.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s Preventable\n\n\n\nImpaired driving is an entirely preventable crime. And it is a real crime with real consequences that won\u2019t just go away when you turn 18. Every state in the U.S. has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to underage intoxicated driving. Penalties vary by state, but can include juvenile detention time, suspended licenses, impounded vehicles and big fines.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Green Shoot Media"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "One of the worst decisions an underage drinker can make is to get behind the wheel \u2014 or to get in the car with a driver that\u2019s been drinking.
