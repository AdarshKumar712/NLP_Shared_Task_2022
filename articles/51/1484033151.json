She does so in this open letter to Frances Willard Munds, who helped lead the crusade for Arizona women\u2019s suffrage a century ago.\n\nDear Ms. Munds:\n\nThe dawn of this new and significant year seems a fitting time to recall Arizona\u2019s role in women\u2019s suffrage and share a bit of good news about the state of our state\u2019s women today. We\u2019ve come a long way over rocky ground, Ms. Munds; maybe farther than you ever dreamed?\n\nOne of the last states to join the union, Arizona was among the first 10 to recognize the women\u2019s vote and has consistently supported women leaders since. Your quest for women\u2019s suffrage, inseparable from the quest for statehood, speaks to the smarts, tenacity and can-do attitude of women in the American West and spotlights their courage.\n\nToday more than 3 million women who call Arizona home have the benefit to live in one of the freest states in America, forged from the strength of our shared native, pioneer and immigrant heritage.\n\nStill young, Arizona finds herself entering her second century of statehood at the forefront of America\u2019s population and economic growth, presenting new chances, if not obligations, to build on the competencies and character of Arizona women.\n\nSuffrage was once considered a threat\n\nPerhaps it is just coincidence that your own grandfather, Alexander Hamilton Willard, was a member of the Lewis and Clark expedition, which recorded the first vote by a woman, Sacagawea. The lone woman and a kidnapped Native American, her very presence was instrumental to the expedition\u2019s success, and her \u201cequal fortitude and resolution\u201d was praised by its leaders.\n\nIn any case, Ms. Munds, it was you who would reset the suffrage strategy, abandoning appeals to male legislative reason and instead go after the male popular vote following decades of legislative defeat \u2014 including a veto by a territorial governor who feared that granting women the right to vote might jeopardize the campaign for statehood.\n\nAfter statehood was safely secured in 1912, you took advantage of our new state Constitution\u2019s provision for citizen initiative, built a larger coalition of support, and with help from outside the state, won women\u2019s suffrage immediately and impressively with nearly 70% of the vote.\n\nWe must pause and duly credit Arizona men with their important role in the victory. The use of citizen initiative, race and immigration would influence state debate and policy for years to come.\n\nArizona women vote and get involved\n\nElation quickly turned to election, and by 1914 women had secured seats in the Arizona Legislature, with you, Ms. Munds, as our first female state senator. Legislation to regulate the workday and increase wages were among the first to be considered.\n\nIt would take another two generations before statutes would be revised to remove the requirement that officeholders be men. Although you did not live to see the day, in 1988 Arizonans would use the title Madam Governor for the first time.\n\nToday, women lead our electorate. Nearly 70% of eligible Arizona women are registered to vote and nearly 60% voted in the 2018 election cycle, with large increases in participation nationally coming from young women.\n\nWhile not yet equal in number, Arizonans are known to elect larger percentages of women and more female governors than other states, once electing all women to statewide office and creating a national sensation.\n\nPhoenix, now our nation\u2019s fifth-largest city, is led by a woman mayor, Kate Gallego, and its public safety is led by a woman police chief, Jeri Williams, and fire chief, Kara Kalkbrenner.\n\nArizona elected her first United States senator, Kyrsten Sinema, in 2018. Her counterpart, Martha McSally, is the first female fighter pilot to command a fighter squadron in combat.\n\nWomen prosecutors bring wrongdoers to justice in our oldest (Sheila Polk in Yavapai) and largest counties (Allister Adel in Maricopa).\n\nAs a teacher, you will appreciate that several of our university and college presidents are women, including Rita Cheng, president of Northern Arizona University, and Maria Harper-Marinick, chancellor of the Maricopa County Community College District.\n\nMany of them are America's leaders\n\nArizona women of color, who even after 1912 and 1920 would be excluded from voting in Arizona due to discrepancies in state and federal law and English literacy requirements, are making their mark.\n\nTucson has just elected its first Latina mayor, Regina Romero. Flagstaff\u2019s mayor, Coral Evans, is African-American.\n\nBeyond local communities, Hispanic, African American and Asian-American women hold statewide constitutional offices (Lea M\u00e1rquez Peterson and Sandra Kennedy, Corporation Commission; Kimberly Yee, State Treasurer). Native American women lead several of Arizona\u2019s 22 tribal nations.\n\nArizona has given America some of her most iconic women leaders. Shortly after statehood, an Arizona woman, Sarah Herring Sorin, was the first to try a case unaccompanied by a man before the United States Supreme Court.\n\nLater, a woman who grew up on a ranch in southern Arizona would become the nation\u2019s first majority leader in the state Senate and go on to become America\u2019s first female U.S. Supreme Court justice \u2013 Sandra Day O'Connor.\n\nThe federal bench includes an Arizonan who is America\u2019s first female Native American judge, Diane J. Humetewa.\n\nAn Arizona woman, Barbara Barrett, serves as secretary of the United States Air Force.\n\nOur nation celebrated a Navajo woman, Annie Dodge Wauneka, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her work in public health.\n\nA Tucson troubadour, Linda Ronstadt, who fused her Hispanic heritage with a mix of musical styles has won the highest of praises with a National Medal of Arts and Kennedy Center honors.\n\nIt is hard to imagine that the women\u2019s vote once threatened Arizona statehood. Today, women define it.\n\nEducation is making womens' lives better\n\nThanks to further changes in federal law, coupled with improvements in health care, education and the economy, a baby girl born into Arizona in 2020 is more able to direct her own life and flourish here, certainly when compared to the baby girl of 1920.\n\nShe has independent access to the modern predicates of financial success, namely higher education and credit markets, giving her more opportunity to increase her earnings, build (and pass on) wealth and overcome hardship no matter her race or life circumstance at birth.\n\nShe has fewer children than generations before, but she \u2013 and they \u2013 are more likely to live longer. In Arizona, she can send them to the school of her choice, whether district, charter or private, or she can educate them at home.\n\nThough her economic status is still likely improved by a spouse, it does not depend on one. In fact, with most jobs requiring learning beyond high school, a young woman\u2019s future prospects depend more on her own level of education.\n\nYoung women seem to be getting this message. More of them attend and graduate college today, taking advantage of higher education institutions and subjects once closed to them, and opening doors to new career opportunities. (Even Barbie, the nation\u2019s most popular fashion doll, has explored some 200 careers since arriving on the scene 50 years ago dressed in her swimsuit.)\n\nBut challenges still persist\n\nEven so, a woman\u2019s journey in the next 100 years is not guaranteed to be of ease. Wage and health disparities persist. More Arizona women and children live in poverty than the national average, a trend that has not improved even amid a growing economy. Women still marry but more also lead households with children, half of which receive federal assistance.\n\nArizona\u2019s best opportunity and future success lies in addressing these challenges, which will be aided by improving educational opportunity and outcomes.\n\nWe hope women\u2019s expanded freedoms and direct participation in self-government bring about a better life for them and their families, and that their increased presence in decision-making and empathic leadership traits bring about a better America, not just a different one.\n\nAfter 100 years of tremendous change, we still are sorting out our relationships, family structures and lifestyles, working to reconcile that change with societal expectations and economic reality.\n\nFew reforms in the name of women\u2019s rights have enjoyed the same cohesion as suffrage. Some, like abortion, contribute to some of our largest partisan divides.\n\nAs women debate these and other issues and as they grow their influence, we hope they will value diversity of thought and demonstrate through civil discourse that a person does not find her voice by shouting over or shutting down the voice of others.\n\nWhat's next for women in Arizona\n\nWhere last century\u2019s reform efforts focused on statehouses and courtrooms, they are now being pursued in board rooms. More companies are recognizing the competitive advantage \u2013 and profitability \u2013 of fairness and opportunity.\n\nBusinesses across industries are working to increase leadership diversity, address pervasive sexual harassment, increase flexibility to accommodate family and move more capable women into management roles \u2013 the first step to increasing the pipeline of women executives.\n\nArizona is well positioned for this next round of reform. Women lead our state\u2019s largest business and trade associations and hold top executive positions at privately held and publicly traded Arizona-based companies.\n\nArizona is recognized among the top states for growing clout among women-owned businesses. Arizona women lead the state\u2019s largest philanthropic ventures and social service non-profits. Women as consumers drive 70% of the market.\n\nIf ever there is to be a perfect convergence of leadership, policy, business practices and social responsibility that benefits all people, it will happen here. As is Arizona tradition, we hope the next round of change will be made in in tandem with men \u2013 not as their subordinates, nor their superiors, neither in spite of them nor in lieu of them, but with them \u2013 in equal partnership and with equal responsibility.\n\nAnd so, Ms. Munds, we gladly join America\u2019s centennial celebration of women\u2019s suffrage and pray for ongoing fortitude and resolution to continue the expansion of freedom for all people. For the Arizona we enjoy through your work and that of your contemporaries, and for lighting the path to a more just and equitable life, you have our enduring thanks and respect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAn Arizona woman\n\nBorn in Alaska, raised in Florida, Eileen Klein has chosen to make her home and career in Arizona, where she has served as state treasurer, chief of staff to a governor and president of the Arizona Board of Regents.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A century ago, Arizona led the nation in women's rights.
