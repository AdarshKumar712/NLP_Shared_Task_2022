Improving yourself is always important.\n\nBut most people don\u2019t manage to make those drastic changes, especially at a stressful time of year, while suffering the after-effects on holiday indulgence, whether that be spirits, food or sweets.\n\nThat\u2019s no way to set yourself up for success.\n\nStill, reflecting on making positive changes isn\u2019t a bad way to finish up the year. Even if you\u2019ve given up on making New Year\u2019s resolutions, taking the time to reflect on where you\u2019ve been and where you are going is always a good way to learn and improve.\n\nWe can be awfully rough on ourselves this time of year with the goals we set, but why not set some more fun goals instead? You could, for example, resolve to spend more time with family or friends.\n\nLearning a new skill is another good one. It might take a little work, but if you pick something you\u2019re always wanted to do, the satisfaction will outweigh the effort.\n\nBut there\u2019s another category that doesn\u2019t revolve around self-improvement, and that\u2019s making the world better for others. Charity doesn\u2019t usually make it too high on the top 10 resolutions list, but it is almost always there, which is a hopeful sign for humanity.\n\nFor instance, think about what would happen if we all resolved to increase our donations to the food bank, or your favourite local charity, by a few dollars a month. How many more people could be helped?\n\nMaking resolutions is fun, no matter whether your goal is improving your body or mind.\n\nBut there is one resolution we\u2019d like to suggest for everyone. Be a little kinder to yourself and everyone around you. It\u2019s the first step on the road to making a better world.\n\nREAD MORE: SilverStar to ring in new year with a pow\n\nREAD MORE: B.C.\u2019s top local news stories of 2019\n\n@VernonNews\n\nletters@vernonmorningstar.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["KIJHL", "North Okanagan Knights", "Celebrations Of Life", "Vernon Vipers", "BCHL"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 10:30:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "What\u2019s your New Year\u2019s resolution?", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://1vuk5m2wsimz2ybwqoijiecq-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/BlackPress/assets/images/icons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "gpsid": 19933109, "generator": "AMP for WP 0.9.98.2", "og": {"locale": "en_CA", "site_name": "Vernon Morning Star", "url": "https://www.vernonmorningstar.com/opinion/editorial-resolving-for-change/", "title": "Editorial: Resolving for change - Vernon Morning Star", "description": "What\u2019s your New Year\u2019s resolution?", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.vernonmorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19933109_web1_191218-SNM-M-happy-new-year-2020-greeting-card-with-fireworks-vector-26362982-1024x683.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 683}, "secure_url": "https://www.vernonmorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19933109_web1_191218-SNM-M-happy-new-year-2020-greeting-card-with-fireworks-vector-26362982-1024x683.jpg"}, "description": "What\u2019s your New Year\u2019s resolution?", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2020-01-01T10:30:00-08:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Editorial: Resolving for change - Vernon Morning Star", "description": "What\u2019s your New Year\u2019s resolution?", "image": "https://www.vernonmorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19933109_web1_191218-SNM-M-happy-new-year-2020-greeting-card-with-fireworks-vector-26362982-1024x683.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 172407059517601}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.vernonmorningstar.com/opinion/editorial-resolving-for-change/"}
