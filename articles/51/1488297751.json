The two officials stressed that talks with the Iraqi government on a continuation of the mission to train Iraqi troops would go on.\n\nGermany has some 120 soldiers in Iraq, though the majority of them are not stationed in Taji and Baghdad but elsewhere in Iraq. The two ministers, speaking about those two locations, said that \u201cthe soldiers deployed there will promptly be moved to Jordan and Kuwait\u201d and can be moved back if training resumes.\n\nGermany had already ordered its soldiers in Taji and Baghdad not to leave their bases after the killing of Soleimani last week near the Baghdad airport.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["smg2_world", "smg_europe", "smg2_news"], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "publish_date": "Tue Jan  7 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "BERLIN - Germany plans to move some of its small troop contingent in Iraq to neighbouring Jordan and Kuwait amid tensions over the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general in an airstrike in Baghdad last week, the news agency dpa reported on Tuesday.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon-thestar.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicon-thestar-144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicon-thestar-70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicon-thestar-150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicon-thestar-310.png", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=379481068", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "thestar.com", "application-name": "thestar.com", "fb": {"pages": 134392236659479}, "storyuuid": "6ae207e74413146f2efd7977de4a8afa", "description": "BERLIN - Germany plans to move some of its small troop contingent in Iraq to neighbouring Jordan and Kuwait amid tensions over the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general in an airstrike in Baghdad last week, the news agency dpa reported on Tuesday.", "keywords": "smg2_world,smg_europe,smg2_news", "news_keywords": "smg2_world,smg_europe,smg2_news", "article": {"published": "2020-01-07", "modified": "2020-01-07", "section": "Europe", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/torontostar"}, "thumbnail": "https://www.thestar.com/assets/img/thestar-ribbon.png", "og": {"title": "Germany to move some troops from Iraq to Jordan, Kuwait | The Star", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/europe/2020/01/07/germany-to-move-some-troops-from-iraq-to-jordan-kuwait.html", "site_name": "thestar.com", "description": "BERLIN - Germany plans to move some of its small troop contingent in Iraq to neighbouring Jordan and Kuwait amid tensions over the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general in an airstrike in Baghdad last week, the news agency dpa reported on Tuesday.", "image": "https://www.thestar.com/assets/img/thestar-ribbon.png"}, "bt": {"url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/europe/2020/01/07/germany-to-move-some-troops-from-iraq-to-jordan-kuwait.html", "id": "6ae207e74413146f2efd7977de4a8afa", "pubDate": 1578378501000, "modDate": 1578378633103, "type": "Story", "dateDisplay": "1:30 AM, Tues., Jan. 7, 2020"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@TorontoStar", "title": "Germany to move some troops from Iraq to Jordan, Kuwait | The Star", "description": "BERLIN - Germany plans to move some of its small troop contingent in Iraq to neighbouring Jordan and Kuwait amid tensions over the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general in an airstrike in Baghdad last week, the news agency dpa reported on Tuesday.", "image": "https://www.thestar.com/assets/img/thestar-ribbon.png"}, "parsely-title": "Germany to move some troops from Iraq to Jordan, Kuwait", "parsely-link": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/europe/2020/01/07/germany-to-move-some-troops-from-iraq-to-jordan-kuwait.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://www.thestar.com/assets/img/thestar-ribbon.png", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-01-07T06:28:21.000Z", "parsely-section": "Europe", "parsely-tags": "smg2_world, smg_europe, smg2_news, word count: <350 words", "parsely-metadata": "{\"storyuuid\": \"6ae207e74413146f2efd7977de4a8afa\"}"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/europe/2020/01/07/germany-to-move-some-troops-from-iraq-to-jordan-kuwait.html"}
