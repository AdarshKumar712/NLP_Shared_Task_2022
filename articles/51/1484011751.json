previous one, The Red Web, I feel like being at the Olympics - you get the best of the best.\n\nThe book is an interesting read, even for someone like me, with knowledge of the Soviet and Russian intelligence services operations abroad. The facts I knew from my work and upbringing in the Soviet system are correctly conveyed, and those I didn't know, are interesting and - in many cases - intriguing.\n\nWhether the reader is in the USA, or the UK, or anywhere, they might realize that the authors cover a huge and wide net, spread around the globe.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting parts are those, which provide information, discovered or put together by the authors - that's where they are the strongest narrators.\n\nThe Western reader might be more interested in the last chapters of the book, which cover the time after 1999, when Mr. Putin came to power, but I can assure you - the others are also quite interesting, *and* they provide the background for better understanding of today's Russia and Mr. Putin's policies.\n\nEspecially of interest for the American readers, in my humble opinion, might be the episodes, describing the financial flows between Russia and the US.\n\nAll over the book, and sometimes even between the lines, one could start seeing the origins of the power of today's ruling elite, and the connections it has built with the West.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion - a must read, definitely would recommend it to friends and colleagues!", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Andrei Soldatov", "Irina Borogan", "Follow The Authors", "Abqa"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Compatriots: The Brutal and Chaotic History of Russia's Exiles, \u00c9migr\u00e9s, and Agents Abroad [Soldatov, Andrei, Borogan, Irina] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers.
