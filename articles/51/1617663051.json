The vote is not expected to take place unless the EU has signed off on the rescue deal.\n\nThe European Commission has asked Lufthansa to waive landing rights for 6 out of 300 planes in total at Frankfurt and Munich airports, where Lufthansa has a two-thirds market share.\n\nThe number of planes and corresponding numbers of airport slots can differ as planes on short-haul flights may have 5-6 slots a day compared to just one for planes on long-haul.\n\nLufthansa has 760 aircraft, although Chief Executive Carsten Spohr has said that 100 will remain grounded due to lower demand following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGermany still hesitating to link stimulus packages with climate targets France, the Netherlands and Austria want to put environmentally friendly conditions on aid for corporations. In Germany, companies themselves are calling for a climate stimulus package, yet Economy Minister Peter Altmaier is hesitating. EURACTIV Germany reports.\n\nNordLB analyst Wolfgang Donie said giving up slots amounting to 3 planes per hub would be manageable.\n\nThe slots could then be given to rivals, increasing competition, which the EU does not want to be compromised by state bailouts.\n\n\u201cState aid rules do allow support for the aviation sector while ensuring that competition and consumers are not at a disadvantage\u201d, a European Commission spokeswoman said, declining to comment on details of the Lufthansa case.\n\nLufthansa called for fair treatment compared with other bailed-out peers and also declined to comment on specifics.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryanair\u2019s O\u2019Leary fumed at the German government\u2019s attitude to state aid.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply ironic that the German government, which lectures all other EU countries about respecting EU rules, has no difficulty breaking the State Aid rules when it comes to Lufthansa,\u201d he said in a statement.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed May 27 07:43:04 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Low-cost carrier Ryanair challenged Germany's \u20ac9 billion rescue package for Lufthansa on Tuesday (26 May), saying it distorted competition, while the German carrier moves towards finalising the deal next month.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/themes/euractiv_com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 5.4.1", "wp-parsely_version": "2.0", "robots": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot-news": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Low-cost carrier Ryanair challenged Germany's \u20ac9 billion rescue package for Lufthansa on Tuesday (26 May), saying it distorted competition, while the German carrier moves towards finalising the deal next month.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ryanair challenges Lufthansa's bailout package", "description": "Low-cost carrier Ryanair challenged Germany's \u20ac9 billion rescue package for Lufthansa on Tuesday (26 May), saying it distorted competition, while the German carrier moves towards finalising the deal next month.", "image": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/Ryanair_Lufthansa-800x450.jpg"}, "og": {"title": "Ryanair challenges Lufthansa's bailout package", "url": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/aviation/news/ryanair-challenges-lufthansas-bailout-package/", "type": "article", "site_name": "www.euractiv.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/Ryanair_Lufthansa-800x450.jpg", "alt": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/aviation/news/ryanair-challenges-lufthansas-bailout-package/"}, "description": "Low-cost carrier Ryanair challenged Germany's \u20ac9 billion rescue package for Lufthansa on Tuesday (26 May), saying it distorted competition, while the German carrier moves towards finalising the deal next month."}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-05-27 07:43:04", "section": "Transport", "tag": "State aid"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/ea_favicon_16x16.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/aviation/news/ryanair-challenges-lufthansas-bailout-package/"}
