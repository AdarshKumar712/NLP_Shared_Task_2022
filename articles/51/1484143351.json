Since Monday, seven people have died as destructive wildfires tore through communities in New South Wales and Victoria on Australia's southeast coast.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, 4,000 people in the coastal town of Mallacoota fled to the shore as winds pushed a fire toward their homes under a sky darkened by smoke and turned blood-red by flames. Stranded residents and vacationers slept in their cars, and gas stations and surf clubs transformed into evacuation areas. Dozens of homes burned before winds changed direction late Tuesday, sparing the rest of the town.\n\nVictoria Emergency Commissioner Andrew Crisp told reporters the Australian Defense Force was moving naval assets to Mallacoota on a supply mission that would last two weeks and helicopters would also fly in more firefighters since roads were inaccessible.\n\nConditions cooled Wednesday, but the fire danger remained very high across the state, where four people are missing.\n\n\"We have three months of hot weather to come. We do have a dynamic and a dangerous fire situation across the state,\" Crisp said.\n\nIn the New South Wales town of Conjola Park, 50 properties were confirmed destroyed and cars were melted by Tuesday's fires. More than 100 fires were still burning in the state Wednesday, though none were at an emergency level. Seven people have died this week, including a volunteer firefighter, a man found in a burned-out car and a father and son who died in their house. Two people in New South Wales are missing.\n\nNew South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said firefighting crews would take advantage of easing conditions Wednesday to restore power to critical infrastructure and conduct some back burning.\n\nClimate change debate\n\nThe early and devastating start to Australia's summer wildfires has led authorities to call this season the worst on record and reignited debate about whether Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative government has taken enough action on climate change. Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas, but Morrison rejected calls last month to downsize Australia's lucrative coal industry.\n\nMorrison won a surprise third term in May. Among his government's pledges was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030, a modest figure compared to the center-left opposition Labor party's pledge of 45%.\n\nThe leader of the minor Australian Greens party, Richard Di Natale, demanded a royal commission, the nation's highest form of inquiry, on the wildfire crisis.\n\n\"If he (Morrison) refuses to do so, we will be moving for a parliamentary commission of inquiry with royal commissionlike powers as soon as parliament returns,\" Di Natale said in a statement.\n\nAbout 5 million hectares (12.35 million acres) of land have burned nationwide over the past few months, with 15 people confirmed dead and more than 1,000 homes destroyed.\n\nFireworks go on\n\nSome communities canceled New Year's fireworks celebrations, but Sydney's popular display over its iconic harbor controversially went ahead in front of more than a million revelers. The city was granted an exemption to a total fireworks ban in place there and elsewhere to prevent new wildfires.\n\nSmoke from the wildfires meant Canberra, the nation's capital, Wednesday had air quality more than 21 times the hazardous rating to be reportedly the worst in the world.\n\nThe smoke has also wafted across the Tasman Sea and into New Zealand.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["UK Business News", "australia"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Australia deployed military ships and aircraft Wednesday to help communities ravaged by apocalyptic wildfir", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.themainstreammedia.com/web/newsnet/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Military ships and aircraft deployed to fight raging Australian fires", "description": "Australia deployed military ships and aircraft Wednesday to help communities ravaged by apocalyptic wildfir", "keywords": "UK Business News, australia", "news_keywords": "UK Business News, australia", "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "1 Day", "og": {"title": "Military ships and aircraft deployed to fight raging Australian fires", "site_name": "Asia Pacific News", "url": "https://www.asiapacificnews.net/news/263577355/military-ships-and-aircraft-deployed-to-fight-raging-australian-fires", "description": "Australia deployed military ships and aircraft Wednesday to help communities ravaged by apocalyptic wildfir", "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/cus1577902777653.jpg", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@asiapacificnow", "title": "Military ships and aircraft deployed to fight raging Australian fires", "description": "Australia deployed military ships and aircraft Wednesday to help communities ravaged by apocalyptic wildfir", "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/cus1577902777653.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/263577355/bushfires-in-australia-continue-to-rage-military-now-involved"}
