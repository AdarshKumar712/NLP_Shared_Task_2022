Spahn comes from the conservative wing of the party, and together, this duo aims to unite the CDU\u2019s two main factions.\n\nFriedrich Merz, an outspoken opponent of Merkel, announced his candidacy alone, calling the election a \u201cdirectional decision for the CDU.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs of today we have the alternative between continuity and departure and renewal. I stand for renewal,\u201d said Merz.\n\nAfter the news of Laschet having Spahn as his running mate broke, R\u00f6ttgen, who also formally announced his candidacy last week, told the press that he plans to put forward a woman as his deputy.
