Mr Mesa said the result was fraudulent and election observers from the OAS also expressed their concerns.\n\nThe following 10 days were marred by mass protests, strikes, blockades and clashes between those backing Mr Morales and those behind Mr Mesa.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Miners marched in support of President Morales on Tuesday...\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ...while supporters of Mr Mesa also took to the streets\n\nInterior Minister Carlos Romero said that two men had been killed in Montero and six injured. He said there would be an investigation into the deaths. Local media has reported that one of the two victims was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds.\n\n'Coup d'\u00e9tat'\n\nMr Morales says that the protests amount to a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\". Mr Mesa and his supporters argue that Mr Morales, who has governed Bolivia since January 2006, is trying to stay in power by rigging the election result.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Morales' Mas party agreed to a binding audit of the results by the OAS. But Mr Mesa, who had previously backed the idea of an audit, said that he now rejected it, arguing that because it had been agreed \"unilaterally\" between the OAS and Mas, he did not trust it.\n\n\"The audit between the OAS and the Mas candidate was agreed without any consultation with the country,\" he said in a video message posted on Twitter [in Spanish].\n\nHe demanded that representatives from Bolivia's civil society be represented.\n\nThe OAS said the audit would take between 10 to 12 days to complete and Foreign Minister Diego Pary added that the Bolivian government had also invited observers from Mexico, Paraguay and Spain to monitor it.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Supporters and opponents of incumbent President Evo Morales dispute the result of the vote.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://web.archive.org/web/20191101002823im_/https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.298.03469/apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Supporters and opponents of incumbent President Evo Morales dispute the result of the vote.", "x-country": "us", "x-audience": "Domestic", "CPS_AUDIENCE": "Domestic", "CPS_CHANGEQUEUEID": 148237630, "og": {"title": "Bolivia post-election clashes turn deadly", "type": "article", "description": "Supporters and opponents of incumbent President Evo Morales dispute the result of the vote.", "site_name": "BBC News", "locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20191101002823/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50248739", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20191101002823im_/https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/32A7/production/_109476921_d51e9117-4bb9-4f8d-a4cc-c06e92664c1e.jpg", "alt": "BBC News.
