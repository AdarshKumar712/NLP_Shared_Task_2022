Media reports said, citing sources from the Pentagon, that Washington was preparing to urgently deploy up to 4,000 troops to the region.\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry on the same day dismissed the \"empty\" accusations coming out of Washington about Iran allegedly orchestrating attacks on the US Embassy in Iraq.\n\nThe Pentagon targeted facilities of Kataib Hezbollah, part of Hashd al-Shabi, in Iraq and Syria over the weekend for allegedly launching a rocket attack on a base in Kirkuk that killed a US contractor. Hashd al-Shabi, also known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces, said dozens of its fighters had been killed in the US strikes.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Iranian supreme leader", "Iraqi protesters", "US embassy", "US airstrikes"], "tags": ["Iraq", "United States", "protests", "Airstrikes", "Iran"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Iraqi protesters on 31 December stormed the US Embassy in Baghdad and torched its outer fence in protest against recent US airstrikes targeting Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah Shiite militants in Iraq and Syria.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/i/sputnik.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Iraqi protesters on 31 December stormed the US Embassy in Baghdad and torched its outer fence in protest against recent US airstrikes targeting Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah Shiite militants in Iraq and Syria.", "keywords": "Iranian supreme leader, Iraqi protesters, US embassy, US airstrikes", "news_keywords": "Iranian supreme leader, Iraqi protesters, US embassy, US airstrikes", "robots": "all", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "ahrefs-site-verification": "ahrefs-site-verification_899ad24abeb428773ae480d902877f72151b81b12d4b7293cbfa1c452c76adcd", "analytics": {"site_domain": "sputniknews.com", "article_id": 1077915586, "p_ts": 1577872312, "rubric": "middleeast", "tags": "Iranian supreme leader, Iraqi protesters, US embassy, US airstrikes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SputnikInt", "url": "https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/202001011077915586-irans-supreme-leader-if-anyone-threatens-us-we-will-confront-them/", "title": "Iran's Supreme Leader: 'If Anyone Threatens Us, We Will Unhesitatingly Confront and Strike Them'", "description": "Iraqi protesters on 31 December stormed the US Embassy in Baghdad and torched its outer fence in protest against recent US airstrikes targeting Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah Shiite militants in Iraq and Syria.", "image": "https://sputniknews.com/sharing_snippet/1077915586.png?1577872312"}, "fb": {"app_id": 799135720145118, "pages": 357990416180}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=969452947, app-argument=com.sputniknews://article?issuer_id=17&issuer_article_id=1077915586", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.sputniknews.sputnik", "og": {"title": "Iran's Supreme Leader: 'If Anyone Threatens Us, We Will Unhesitatingly Confront and Strike Them'", "url": "https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/202001011077915586-irans-supreme-leader-if-anyone-threatens-us-we-will-confront-them/", "type": "website", "description": "Iraqi protesters on 31 December stormed the US Embassy in Baghdad and torched its outer fence in protest against recent US airstrikes targeting Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah Shiite militants in Iraq and Syria.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn4.img.sputniknews.com/images/107683/96/1076839645.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 440}}, "lastmod": "2020-01-01T13:19:16Z", "pubdate": "2020-01-01T12:51:52Z", "url_type": "usual"}, "canonical_link": "https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/202001011077915586-irans-supreme-leader-if-anyone-threatens-us-we-will-confront-them/"}
