I was looking to get into something that would give me a good workout, and once I got into MMA, I realized I really like it. And once I started fighting, I realized I was pretty good. I kept going and fell in love with the sport.\"\n\n\n\nHe is coached by Jose Burgos, who has been training fighters part time for nearly six years. He has a training facility (Common Grounds Grappling Club) in Nashville, Ohio. Triway graduate Eddie Flinner is another fighter with local roots, fighting out of club.\n\n\n\n\"Lucas is an all-around mixed martial artists,\" Burgos said. \"He is good everywhere the fight goes. One area he is particularly slick is with his hands. He has good movement and footwork, and because of that he can really sit down on his punches.\"\n\n\n\nMast is 7-1 in his young career, but the event at Harvest Ridge marks his professional debut.\n\n\n\nBurgos and Mast came together sort of by accident.\n\n\n\n\"I came into his barbershop in Berlin looking for a job as a barber,\" Burgos said. \"He found out that I fight and was a teacher, and I found out he wanted to fight.\"\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s how things started.\n\n\n\n\"He asked if I thought he\u2019d be any good, and I told him if he trains hard and does what I tell him to do, I can get him to a certain point,\" Burgos said. \"He\u2019s done that.\"\n\n\n\nThe Honor Fighting Championship was founded in 2017. Event promoter Jeremy Caudill and Melanie Lockard, who lost a battle with cancer in October, were introduced to Michelle Kring and Scott Corbin, who have been in the MMA world for over 10 years. They came up with Honor Fighting Championship, a platform for fighters to showcase their skills.\n\n\n\n\"Lucas is a fighter I have personally watched closely because he has heart and what it takes to take him all the way,\" Caudill said. \"He is a business man; very smart. He is young and he knows what he wants and goes and gets it.\"\n\n\n\nCaudill said he wanted to have a military theme with Honor Fighting Championship to honor all military people past, present and future.\n\n\n\n\"We have signed with Vet Tix to give vets free tickets to our show,\" he said. \"Honor Fighting Championship quickly became a big deal in the MMA world in Ohio.\"\n\n\n\nCaudill brought showman skills to the show, adding lights, music and a certain element that made Honor the place to fight.\n\n\n\n\"Within our first year of business we were already planning on doing a big show at Cleveland Nautica's Jacobs Pavilion,\" he said. \"That show was a big success. Honor did a show in Millersburg last May, and that show was a great turnout. The town welcomed us with open arms.\"\n\n\n\nHe is looking forward to a triumphant return.\n\n\n\nThe Honor Fighting Championship event at Harvest Ridge Event Center, 8880 state Route 39, gets under way at 5:30 p.m.\n\n\n\nRing of Honor seats are $80. Circle of Honor are $60. General admission tickets are $30.
