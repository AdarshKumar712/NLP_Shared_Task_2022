Bernie Sanders at 15 percent, Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 14 percent and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg with 7 percent.\n\nThe remaining Democratic primary candidates had 6 percent or less support in the poll.\n\nF&M College\u2019s October poll had Biden with 30 percent, leading Warren, who had 18 percent, and Sanders at 12 percent. Bloomberg had not yet entered the race when that poll was taken.\n\nWhen asked who their second choice for president would be, 26 percent of Democrats said Warren, followed by Sanders and Biden tied at 18 percent each, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 11 percent.\n\nA statement from F&M College pollsters said the contest between Biden, Warren and Sanders \"is driven by ideology\" with 72 percent of Sanders voters and 73 percent of Warren supporters identifying themselves as liberal, compared to just 40 percent of Biden supporters.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s primary is on April 28.\n\nTwenty percent of Democrats said healthcare is their top issue in picking a candidate and 42 percent said honesty is the quality they want most in one.\n\nTrump\u2019s numbers remain worrisome for Republicans, but while only 41 percent said he deserves re-election that is up from October when 37 percent said he did. Fifty-seven percent said it is time for a change in the White House, compared to 59 percent in October.\n\nAsked to rate Trump\u2019s job performance, 21 percent rated it as excellent, 17 percent as good, 12 percent as fair and 49 percent as poor.\n\nOf the respondents supporting Trump, 83 percent said they would vote for him no matter who ran against him, while 87 percent of people opposing him said they would vote against him regardless of which Democrat challenges him.\n\nTrump and the top three Democratic candidates are all underwater when it comes to their favorable/unfavorable ratings. F&M College found that Trump was at 41 percent/55 percent, Biden was at 43 percent/47 percent, Sanders was at 39 percent/54 percent and Warren was at 37 percent/46 percent.\n\nRegionally, 51 percent of respondents from southwestern Pennsylvania said Trump should not be voted out while 33 percent said it is time for a change.\n\nAmong the Democratic candidates, 22 percent of southwestern Pennsylvania voters chose \"other\" and 31 percent said they had no preferred candidate, while 15 percent picked Sanders, 14 percent went with Biden and Bloomberg, and Warren received no votes.\n\nNatural gas fracking has become an issue in the race with several Democratic candidates promising to ban the controversial extraction practice. Fifty-five percent of southwestern Pennsylvania respondents oppose a fracking ban and 28 percent support one.\n\nPhiladelphia (67 percent) and Allegheny County (61 percent) had the strongest support for a fracking ban while southwestern and central Pennsylvania (47 percent) had the strongest opposition to a ban.\n\nOverall, state voters support fracking 48 percent to 44 percent.\n\nThe F&M College poll surveyed 628 registered voters between Jan. 20 and 26. The margin of error is plus or minus 6.2 percentage points for the poll and plus or minus 9 percentage points for questions to 292 registered Democrats.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["J.D.
