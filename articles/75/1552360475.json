That means, whether voluntarily, preemptively or under direction, major events like the Flying Pig Marathon, Ohio\u2019s primary election and even Sunday mass have been rescheduled or suspended; orders have been issued requiring social distancing in public; bars and restaurants have had to shut their dining rooms and shared spaces; live music events and theater runs have been canceled \u2014 basically, regular life is on hold as we deal with COVID-19.\n\nAnd the effect of all of the above has had a direct impact on us here at the paper.\n\nThe reality is CityBeat is and always has been a free publication, both in print and online \u2014 there\u2019s no subscription fee and no paywall, which means our revenue relies 100 percent on Cincinnatians being able to gather at concerts, theaters, restaurants, bars, museums, festivals and even our own events. As advertisers have had to make tough decisions and cut their budgets to weather the quarantine, we are asking for your support.\n\nWe have no idea how this pandemic is going to affect us long-term, and everyone will need as much information as they can get.Our small but mighty local team works tirelessly to cover issues that matter to the community, and to spotlight Cincinnati businesses and the city's active cultural scene.
