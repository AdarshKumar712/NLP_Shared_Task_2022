Some parents\u2019 imaginations are no match for the current dark, snowless conditions, however.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t let that get you down, says Panu K\u00f6n\u00f6nen, marketing and communications manager of the Outdoor Association of Finland, as woodlands are often close at hand and they offer many options for impromptu outings.\n\nIf you\u2019re running out of ideas for activities for your youngsters, try a few of these tips.\n\n1. A forest trek\n\nPlan a walk to a nearby campfire, camping hut or lean-to. Make sure to pack enough snacks and a thermos with warm juice or cocoa. Building a fire and enjoying a bite in a darkening forest is an experience in itself.\n\nStory continues after photo.\n\nImage: Timo Sipola / Yle\n\nYou can also incorporate a theme or story for the trip if the prospect of a hike might otherwise seem dull. Suggest a search for a troll forest or examine the different kinds of leaves or animals you can find in the woods.\n\n2. Touch and tell\n\nPunch holes in the sides of a cardboard box. Place different objects in the box so your kids can touch them and guess what they are. You can help out by providing clues. The greater the variety of objects you put in the box, the more fun for everyone!\n\nThe box can do double duty as a makeshift picnic hamper.\n\n3. Create an outdoor gym\n\nWho needs a pricey gym when you can use the forest or even your backyard for a fun workout? Adults and youngsters can do pushups against trees or you can hang from a sturdy branch to develop upper body strength.\n\nDon\u2019t forget piggyback, an old favourite for the young and not-so-young. Encourage the kids to use their imagination and develop power moves for the entire family.\n\nIf you run out of ideas, you can consult the Outdoor Association of Finland\u2019s website for more outdoor activity suggestions (in Finnish).\n\n\n\n4. A reflector trail\n\nCreate a reflector trail in your nearby forest or backyard by hanging safety reflectors from trees and shrubs. Have the entire family use flashlights to follow the trail and find all of the reflectors.\n\nStory continues after photo.\n\nImage: Tarja Hiltunen / Yle\n\nThe trail can be incorporated into a treasure hunt or it can lead to a campfire. You can also stash treats such as small toys or plush animals along the way.\n\n5. A treasure hunt\n\nPlace a small LED light inside the small yellow box that comes in chocolate eggs. Or you can use some other glass or plastic container to create a magical effect with the light. Hide the containers in the nearby forest or your backyard so children can look for the hidden treasure.\n\n6. Stage an animal rescue\n\nA variation of the treasure hunt, this activity calls for a Bluetooth speaker, a smartphone and a stuffed toy.\n\nStory continues after photo.\n\nImage: Meeri M\u00e4nnikk\u00f6 / Yle\n\nFirst, hide the plush toy and the speaker in the same place. Make sure the connection between the phone and speaker is activated and working so you can play animal sounds.\n\nParticipants try to track the animal (plushie) \u2013 for example a lion \u2013 by following the roaring sound. This activity is suitable for indoors as well as outdoors.\n\n7. Cops and robbers in the dark\n\nForm players into two teams. One team represents the police and is armed with flashlights. The other team is the robbers, who then try to get to their hideout without being caught by police.\n\nThe game begins when the robbers shout, \"This is a hold-up!\" If a police officer shines the light on a robber and shouts his name, the robber must freeze. Another robber can rescue her frozen partner in crime by crawling between his legs.\n\nThe game ends when all the robbers have either safely made it to the hideout or have been rounded up by police.\n\n8. Upside down day\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love a chance to disregard norms and turn things topsy turvy? On upside down day, your family can have dinner for breakfast and wish each other \"Good night\" instead of \"Good morning\".\n\nTake it all one step further by wearing your clothes on the wrong side and walking backwards!\n\nSuggested activities were provided by the Outdoor Association of Finland and the Mannerheim League for Child Welfare.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Who needs a pricey gym when you can use the forest or even your backyard for a fun workout?", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//yle.fi/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "Who needs a pricey gym when you can use the forest or even your backyard for a fun workout?", "og": {"description": "Who needs a pricey gym when you can use the forest or even your backyard for a fun workout?", "type": "article", "title": "No snow?
