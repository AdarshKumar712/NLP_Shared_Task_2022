Dr. Nisha Thampi and colleagues adapted the tune of the song Brother John, also known as Frere Jacques, replacing its lyrics with a six-step handwash practice prescribed by World Health Organization.

They wrote the lyrics with the help of schoolchildren. \u201cTo get my own children to wash their hands with the proper technique, I played with each step until it fell into a song pattern that flowed nicely to the tune of Brother John,\u201d Thampi said.\n\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The Brother John lyrics: \u201cAre you sleeping, are you sleeping, Brother John, Brother John, Morning bells are ringing, morning bells are ringing, Ding, ding, dong; ding, ding, dong\u201d . . . were replaced with: \u201cScrub your palms, between the fingers Wash the back (one hand), wash the back (other hand) Twirl the tips (one hand) around (other hand) Scrub them upside down Thumb attack (one thumb)! Thumb attack (other thumb)!\u201d Thampi then used her 8-year-old daughter as a test case. \u201cShe heard the first version of the song and helped revise it to have better flow. She demonstrated it to her friends and classmates,\u201d Thampi said. To test whether the routine would be effective in removing germs, the researchers applied fluorescent markings on the hands of the children, who were between 6 and 9 years old, before they washed with soap and water while singing the song. After the routine, there was a significant reduction in the markings, according to a report in The BMJ.\n\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cThis song is a fun way to teach children how to wash their hands and has the potential to decrease the burden of germs on hands, a very common way of catching an infection,\u201d Thampi told Reuters Health. She said her daughter also taught the song and technique to Thampi\u2019s 4-year-old son. To be effective, the technique should ideally be implemented early in life, used regularly and embedded into the national curriculum in schools, said Nicky Milner, director of medical education at the School of Medicine, Anglia Ruskin University, in Chelmsford, UK. Involving schoolchildren in the design of actions and choice of song was also key to the technique\u2019s effectiveness, she added. \u201cWe know children enjoy learning through the use of songs that are easily remembered and accompanied by simple actions,\u201d Milner said in an email.\n\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content There is potential for the technique to be used internationally, if the song choice reflects local songs in different countries, she noted. \u201cThis approach may help reduce the global burden of infections that are spread by poor hand hygiene,\u201d she said. Thampi\u2019s team hopes to validate their findings in larger school settings and demonstrate that the song is effective in reducing respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses, and school absenteeism. \u201cWe are also in the process of translating the mnemonic into other languages so the song and video can be easily adopted across the globe,\u201d she said.
