profit plunge in the first quarter as the coronavirus outbreak closed dealerships and halted production.\n\nGlobal sales fell 23% to 2.0 million vehicles in the first three months of the year, from 2.6 million in the year-earlier quarter, the company said Wednesday. Operating earnings excluding financial items such as interest and taxes shrank by 81% to 0.9 billion euros from 4.8 billion euros ($5.2 billion) a year earlier.\n\nThe company said Wednesday that despite the disruption from the virus it remained financially strong with what it termed a \u201crobust\u201d cash pile of 17.8 billion euros (%19 billion). Sales revenue fell by 8.3% to 55.1 billion euros.\n\nChief financial officer Frank Witter said in a statement that \u201cthe global COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted our business in the first quarter. We\u2019ve taken numerous countermeasures to cut costs and ensure liquidity and we continue to be robustly positioned financially. The Volkswagen Group is steering through this unprecedented crisis with focus and determination.\u201d\n\nThe quarter was marked by the shutdown of the company\u2019s plants due to the virus outbreak. Production has re-started in China and is being brought back online in Europe. Auto dealerships have reopened in major markets China and Germany.\n\nThe company said it still expected to make an operating profit for the year but that earnings would be \u201cseverely below\u201d last year\u2019s.\n\nVolkswagen, headquartered in Wolfsburg, Germany, makes cars under brands including Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, SEAT, Skoda and Lamborghini.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Associated Press.
