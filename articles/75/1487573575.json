This data provides the ability to see information such as daily jail population, monthly jail population and demographical data such as race, ethnicity, gender, age, felony or misdemeanor charges, as well as if an inmate is being held because of pretrial requirements, a judge-ordered sentence or through a contract for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.\n\nAdditionally, large data sets will be broken down for internal analysis to help community stakeholders identify trends in jail population, according to the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nThis initiative was undertaken after listening to input from the public and external community partners, including the recently created Lake County Criminal Justice Citizen\u2019s Council, the sheriff\u2019s office stated. Sharing jail population data is being billed as a way to increase transparency, reduce the amount of Freedom of Information Act and other requests, and provide vital information to government and community organizations to try to identify solutions to reduce recidivism.\n\n\u201cMaking this data available to the public is another step in opening our doors and being transparent,\u201d Sheriff John Idleburg said. \u201cThe community has been asking for these data sets for years, and I am happy to make it happen. While we are not responsible for the charges many of our inmates are being held on, I believe the community should have the demographical information about who is being held in custody and why.\u201d\n\nTo access the data, visit http://www.lakecountyil.gov/sheriff or https://public.tableau.com/profile/loyola.lake.county#!/vizhome/LakeCountyJailDashboardVersion/Dashboard2.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Lake County Sheriff's Office", "Lake County Jail", "Loyola University Chicago", "jail demographics", "U.S. Bureau of Prisons", "Sheriff John Idleburg"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office in December launched a new initiative to share demographic information from the Lake County Jail with the community.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/(cache-forever,mtime=1381862774)/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office launches online method to share jail population data", "description": "The Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office in December launched a new initiative to share demographic information from the Lake County Jail with the community.", "image": "https://www.lakecountyjournal.com/articles/2019/12/28/908415f2bf774d8285e8e98e402f4c5c/46094444-9578-4b81-b8c3-c12b24795a74/image-pv_web.jpg", "site": "@lakectyjournal"}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.lakecountyjournal.com/2019/12/28/lake-county-sheriffs-office-launches-online-method-to-share-jail-population-data/a8e1wgr/", "title": "Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office launches online method to share jail population data", "description": "The Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office in December launched a new initiative to share demographic information from the Lake County Jail with the community.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.lakecountyjournal.com/_internal/cimg!0/3idemkcbz66vbfd4wc4ufeip5m2w1pr", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 451, "height": 333}}, "description": "The Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office in December launched a new initiative to share demographic information from the Lake County Jail with the community.", "keywords": "Lake County Sheriff's Office, Lake County Jail, Loyola University Chicago, jail demographics, U.S. Bureau of Prisons, Sheriff John Idleburg", "fb": {"app_id": 1388278471211028}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "cf4700a7-1439-47d0-b0ba-003aac702dd5"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.lakecountyjournal.com/2019/12/28/lake-county-sheriffs-office-launches-online-method-to-share-jail-population-data/a8e1wgr/"}
