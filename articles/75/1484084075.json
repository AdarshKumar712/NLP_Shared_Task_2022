The administration needs our support.\n\n\u201cA great leader takes people to where they ought to be and not where they want to be. It may look difficult now but we shall all smile at the end of the day,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former governor thanked APC members at the state level for their patience and support.\n\n\u201d Our reconciliation is still ongoing and positive steps have been made. We should eschew the bitterness of the past and forgive.\u201d\n\nAjimobi reiterated his commitment and support for the party, noting that \u201d as humans, we are bound to offend one another.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people offended me and I offended some people too. But in the spirit of true reconciliation, we should forgive one another and allow the past to end with 2019.\n\n\u201cLet us chart a new course of love and reconciliation for ourselves and the party in 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll our actions and activities should be geared toward strengthening our party.\u201d\n\n...", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Francelet Saint-Val"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 13:37:36 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://nigerianobservernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/favicon2.ico?189db0&189db0", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "New Year: Ajimobi rallies support for Buhari, APC", "type": "article", "description": "IBADAN \u2013 Former Gov.Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo State has called on Nigerians to keep hope alive and support President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration and the All Progressives Congress (APC).
