He also appeared to leave the door open for eventual negotiations with the U.S.\n\nKim has used the diplomatic stalemate to expand his military capabilities by intensifying tests of shorter-range weapons. His arsenal is now estimated to include 40 to 50 nuclear bombs and various delivery systems, including solid-fuel missiles designed to beat missile-defense systems and developmental ICBMs potentially capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.\n\nKim has also strengthened his negotiating position, moving the diplomacy closer to an arms reduction negotiation between nuclear states rather than talks that would culminate in a unilateral surrender of the weapons he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.\n\nHARRY KAZIANIS: NORTH KOREA\u2019S KIM HAS THIS GOAL IN MIND (NO, HE\u2019S NOT CRAZY). HERE\u2019S HOW TRUMP SHOULD RESPOND\n\nLee Sang-min, a spokesman for South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, said North Korea carrying out its threat to showcase a new strategic weapon would be unhelpful for diplomacy.\n\nKim\u2019s comments published in state media Wednesday were made at a key, four-day meeting of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s Central Committee as talks between Washington and Pyongyang have faltered over disagreements on disarmament steps and the removal of sanctions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he had a good relationship with Kim and thought the North Korean leader would keep his word, Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cHe likes me, I like him. We get along. He\u2019s representing his country, I\u2019m representing my country. We have to do what we have to do.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cBut he did sign a contract, he did sign an agreement talking about denuclearization,\u201d Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Dictator Kim Jong Un said North Korea was no longer obligated to comply with a self-imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and intercontinental", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://590kid.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-512_KID-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Dictator Kim Jong Un said North Korea was no longer obligated to comply with a self-imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and intercontinental", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "generator": "Feed to Post 3.10", "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "http://590kid.com", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://590kid.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-512_KID-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "http://590kid.com/kim-jong-un-threatens-to-renew-testing-nuclear-weapons-long-range-missiles/"}
