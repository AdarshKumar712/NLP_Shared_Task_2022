Despite this good news, thousands of residents and tourists are in need of food, water and medicine \u2013 and with fires still making road access difficult, the Navy is sending ships to aid the evacuation effort, while heavy-lift helicopters are being deployed to evacuate the most vulnerable. A joint task force from the Navy and Air Force has been established to co-ordinate the rescue effort. Defence Minister Linda Reynolds authorized the deployment of four helicopters, one fixed-wing aircraft and two ships. The helicopters include one Chinook, two Black Hawks and one Taipan naval chopper. Two C-27J Spartan battlefield airlifters from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base at East Sale will also be available for support efforts. RAAF bases are currently being used as SAR bases, providing meals to firefighters, accommodation to volunteers and assisting in fire mapping.\n\nAdditional aerial firefighting resources \u2013 including personnel and aircraft \u2013 have been requested from the US and Canada.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Editorial Team", "Mandy Langfield"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Ships and helicopters from the Australian Defence Force have been deployed to East Gippsland in an effort to rescue thousands of people who have been stranded on a beach by out of control bushfires.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/themes/custom/voyageur_amr/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"title": "Military assets deployed in Australian bushfire emergency | AirMed&Rescue", "og": {"determiner": "Automatic", "site_name": "AirMed&Rescue", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.airmedandrescue.com/latest/news/military-assets-deployed-australian-bushfire-emergency", "title": "Military assets deployed in Australian bushfire emergency", "description": "Ships and helicopters from the Australian Defence Force have been deployed to East Gippsland in an effort to rescue thousands of people who have been stranded on a beach by out of control bushfires.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.airmedandrescue.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2019-12/fire-australia.jpg?h=b1f65f60&itok=ldAh4suT", "url": "https://www.airmedandrescue.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2019-12/fire-australia.jpg?h=b1f65f60&itok=ldAh4suT", "secure_url": "https://www.airmedandrescue.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2019-12/fire-australia.jpg?h=b1f65f60&itok=ldAh4suT", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2019-12-31T09:24:33+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Military assets deployed in Australian bushfire emergency", "description": "Ships and helicopters from the Australian Defence Force have been deployed to East Gippsland in an effort to rescue thousands of people who have been stranded on a beach by out of control bushfires.", "site": {"identifier": "@airmedandrescue", "id": 299551909}, "url": "https://www.airmedandrescue.com/latest/news/military-assets-deployed-australian-bushfire-emergency", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.airmedandrescue.com/sites/default/files/styles/twitter_card/public/2019-12/fire-australia.jpg?itok=jDrQ1pKI", "height": 512, "width": 1024}}, "robots": "index, follow", "dcterms.title": "Military assets deployed in Australian bushfire emergency", "description": "Ships and helicopters from the Australian Defence Force have been deployed to East Gippsland in an effort to rescue thousands of people who have been stranded on a beach by out of control bushfires.", "original-source": "https://www.airmedandrescue.com/latest/news/military-assets-deployed-australian-bushfire-emergency", "dcterms.contributor": "Editorial Team", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-config": "/themes/custom/voyageur_amr/favicons/browserconfig.xml"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.airmedandrescue.com/latest/news/military-assets-deployed-australian-bushfire-emergency"}
