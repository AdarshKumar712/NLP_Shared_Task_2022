There are few other countries with our diversity of race, culture and religion.\n\nWe have Malays, Chinese, Indians and many other races living in harmony. Sometimes, this harmony and our unity are challenged. But because of mutual respect, we always come together as one.\n\nForeigners are often surprised at how open and friendly we are, making them feel at home. This is because we are not a homogenous society and our diversity makes us tolerant of each other as we are exposed to other races and cultures on a daily basis.\n\nOne obvious benefit is that it allows Malaysians to be comfortable when conducting ourselves globally, whether it is in business or other endeavours.\n\nA second obvious benefit is in our language. Many Malaysians are either bilingual or trilingual. Or even if we are not fluent in a second language, we do at least know a smattering of its words.\n\nAnd it is not unusual for us to use words from two or more languages in a conversation. This makes for a richer, more interesting Malaysian culture.\n\nAnd third, and perhaps the most obvious benefit, is our delicious food.\n\nWe not only have many different cuisines, but we have also been able to fuse them to create a foodie paradise in Malaysia.\n\nUnfortunately, this diversity in race, religion and culture is also our weakness. Our diversity means that we, as a society, can be easily divided. It doesn\u2019t take much to do this.\n\nAll one needs is to find a cause that champions one race, whether culturally or religiously, at the expense of another. This will cause division. We have seen this happen from time to time.\n\nIt is almost an inevitable part of life in our nation. This is most unfortunate because most Malaysians want to live in a harmonious rather than a disharmonious society.\n\nWe want to live in peace with all races and religions so that we can all prosper, be happy and healthy together. Disunity will destroy that.\n\nSo to whose advantage is it to sow the seeds of discord, division and disunity?\n\nWithout too much speculation, it would appear to be those who harbour a political agenda.\n\nThey yearn to be noticed so that they may climb up the political ladder, whether in opposition or in government. They may raise or champion a cause even though such a cause ultimately benefits no one.\n\nYet they do not realise that even though they may have achieved something politically, our Malaysian society is the ultimate loser.\n\nThey have succeeded in driving a wedge between fellow Malaysians, causing fear and disharmony. This is not a Malaysia we want to live in.\n\nSo as we step into a new decade, we should recognise that our diversity is both our strength and our weakness. If our aim was to be become a developed nation in 2020, we should also recognise that we should want Malaysia to develop not only economically, but also as a society.\n\nDeveloping as a society means promoting the causes of unity and harmony and celebrating our very diversity.\n\nTUNKU HALIM\n\nPetaling jaya, Selangor\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect those of the New Straits Times", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sun Jan  5 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "LETTERS:MALAYSIA is one of the most unique countries in the world.
