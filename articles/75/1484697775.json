Dr Keith Jarrett and Dr James Ashby heard the news on December 18 that they had passed, which Dr Ashby said was a \"big relief\". \"I've been doing exams for the last 15 years and that should be it now,\" he said. Port Lincoln GP Dr David Lam said the two doctors staying in Port Lincoln was a \"big win\" for the Eyre Peninsula. \"This is a big win for the region as more and more we're struggling to recruit and retain young doctors because of how hard the job is out here compared to in the city,\" Dr Lam said. \"Sadly, it is rare that GPs-in-training stay in Lincoln more than 12 months so these guys have done well and are the first doctors for years now to stay beyond 12 months and complete their final exams.\" Dr Ashby said he came to Port Lincoln \"by accident\" and liked it so stayed. \"I have chosen to stay in Port Lincoln because the staff and other doctors at Lincoln Medical Centre have been so supportive and easy to work with - the friendly community has also helped,\" he said. \"It is vital that we continue to promote rural general practice and recruit doctors to fill the gaps left by those retiring...I think in Port Lincoln we are very lucky with the medical care we have. \"I hope that by advocating for the local area and showing visiting medical students and registrars the great parts of working in Port Lincoln that we can attract more of them to stay and work in the area longer term.\" In addition to the two fully accredited GPs, eight fifth-year medical students who were on rural placement last year in Port Lincoln have also passed their final exams to become doctors, with one, Sarah Jones staying on after her exams to December 20. \"It is a wonderful (if not a bit surreal) feeling to have passed my final medical school exams, along with the seven other students who studied in Port Lincoln this year,\" she said. \"Living and studying in Port Lincoln exceeded all of my expectations and has been the best year of my medical degree so far. \"I am so thankful to the doctors and wider community for being so welcoming...during the year I have enjoyed many community activities including playing netball for Wanilla, sailing at the Coffin Bay Yacht Club and attending lots of local markets. \"It is disappointing that we still have so far to go in terms of removing location as a variable for health equity...I would love to see the rural internship pathway expanded in SA. \"I am excited to see what the future holds and would be very pleased to live and work in Port Lincoln again in the future.\"\n\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/Lauren.dinning/5b2b093e-2dd8-488b-ae0e-be681932b514.jpg/r0_183_3798_2329_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Lauren Fitzgerald"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 13:43:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Dr Keith Jarrett and Dr James Ashby heard the news on December 18 that they were fully accredited, which Dr Ashby said was a \"big relief\".", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//nnstatic-a.akamaihd.net/s/1576119584/sites/port-lincoln-times/ico/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "title": "Two local doctors pass final GP exams", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Dr Keith Jarrett and Dr James Ashby heard the news on December 18 that they were fully accredited, which Dr Ashby said was a \"big relief\".", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/portlincolntimes/", "published_time": "2020-01-02T13:43:00+10:30"}, "og": {"title": "Doctors pass final GP exams", "url": "https://www.portlincolntimes.com.au/story/6564153/doctors-pass-final-gp-exams/", "site_name": "Port Lincoln Times", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/Lauren.dinning/5b2b093e-2dd8-488b-ae0e-be681932b514.jpg/r0_183_3798_2329_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "secure_url": "https://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/Lauren.dinning/5b2b093e-2dd8-488b-ae0e-be681932b514.jpg/r0_183_3798_2329_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 678, "width": 1200}, "description": "Dr Keith Jarrett and Dr James Ashby heard the news on December 18 that they were fully accredited, which Dr Ashby said was a \"big relief\"."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ptlincolntimes", "title": "Doctors pass final GP exams", "description": "Dr Keith Jarrett and Dr James Ashby heard the news on December 18 that they were fully accredited, which Dr Ashby said was a \"big relief\".", "image": "https://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/Lauren.dinning/5b2b093e-2dd8-488b-ae0e-be681932b514.jpg/r0_183_3798_2329_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}, "news_keywords": "news, local-news,", "author": "Lauren Fitzgerald", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msvalidate.01": "F29B95B17E7034DD0832B3DBEF37C0F2"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.portlincolntimes.com.au/story/6564153/doctors-pass-final-gp-exams/"}
