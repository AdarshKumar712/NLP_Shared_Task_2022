For instance, he\u2019s so deeply lost in a haze of projection that whenever he randomly accuses an adversary of something awful, it usually turns out Trump himself is guilty of that same exact thing.\n\nThat brings us to Donald Trump\u2019s behavior over the past few days. For instance, Trump just said that he doesn\u2019t think Joe Biden can remember what he said or did yesterday. If you follow Biden, you know that he gets roughly as tongue-tied these days as he did in his youth, but he\u2019s still plenty sharp. Trump\u2019s false assertion that Biden is so far gone he can\u2019t remember what he was doing yesterday? That sounds like Trump admitting that he can\u2019t remember what he was doing yesterday \u2013 and if you follow Trump\u2019s behavior, it\u2019s pretty clear that he\u2019s in severe cognitive decline.\n\nIn another disturbing example, Trump tripled down last night on his insistence that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough once murdered an intern. This is absolutely not the case, and Trump is certainly not helping his cause by continuing to make this false accusation. But considering Trump\u2019s sense of projection, it does make you wonder if Trump has gotten violent with his own female employees in the past, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s so obsessively trying to pin this same crime on Scarborough.\n\nThe point of projection is to try to steer blame and attention away from yourself by pinning your failings on others. But Donald Trump keeps getting worse at this. At this point he\u2019s being so blatant and oddly specific about it, he\u2019s practically telegraphing what we should go digging for in his past, in his medical records, and so on. Trump can\u2019t even do projection right anymore. His mind really does seem to be failing \u2013 as he seemed to acknowledge when when he essentially admitted that he can no longer remember what he\u2019s doing from one day to the next.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Bill Palmer"], "publish_date": "Sun May 24 09:09:25 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/apple-touch-icon.png?v=yyawbbNr0G", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Donald Trump's projection is showing - Palmer Report", "description": "...", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.palmerreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/donald-trump-6.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 707}, "url": "http://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/projection-is-showing-donald-trump/28984/", "site_name": "Palmer Report", "updated_time": "2020-05-23T22:54:11-04:00", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"author": "http://facebook.com/palmerreport", "published_time": "2020-05-24T13:09:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-05-24T02:54:11+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thebillpalmer"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s projection is showing", "description": "...", "image": "https://www.palmerreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/donald-trump-6.jpg", "site": "@dailynewsbin", "creator": "@palmerreport", "partner": "tfwp"}, "description": "...", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "generator": "WordPress 5.4.1", "msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml?v=yyawbbNr0G", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 1384489154966201}, "google-site-verification": "oI6DAt_bQaOSlXJmHhN8cZFU9F36Mm2hyjmSqGH_JFU"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/projection-is-showing-donald-trump/28984/"}
