Water and wastewater rates will go up by 4.1 per cent.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nREAD MORE: 2019 carbon tax rebate decreases in Saskatchewan\n\nAn increase in the federal carbon tax, which takes place on April 1, will affect SaskEnergy and Saskatoon Light and Power rates, the former of which is expected to increase by six per cent, according to SaskEnergy.
