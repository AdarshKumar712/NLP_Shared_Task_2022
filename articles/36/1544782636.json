In this, with the votes of first preference, the Congress and BJP are fixed as one seat each and the fight is on for the third seat.\n\nAccording to sources, the Congress refused to give Mr Scindia a first preference seat that would secure his nomination.\n\nMr Scindia, a key Madhya Pradesh leader considered instrumental in the Congress's victory in the state election in December 2018, had to step back as Kamal Nath was made Chief Minister.\n\nOver the past year, Mr Scindia, who also lost last year's parliamentary election, felt slighted and undermined in the Congress.\n\nSources say a Rajya Sabha nomination for him was strongly opposed by Kamal Nath. By the time he came around, Mr Scindia's talks with the BJP leadership, especially Amit Shah, had gone far.\n\nThe BJP sensed an opportunity to pull in Mr Scindia when he was denied a Rajya Sabha seat by the Congress six months ago, according to sources. That was the time he received the first feelers from the BJP.\n\nThere were several secret meetings over the next few months, according to sources.\n\nMr Scindia was 31 when he was first elected to parliament from Guna in Madhya Pradesh in 2002, as he won a by-election held following his father Madhavrao Scindia's death.\n\nHe subsequently served as union minister in different Congress governments.\n\n\"Scindia could have been Congress nominee to Rajya Sabha but only Modi-Shah can give cabinet post to the over-ambitious leader,\" said Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, one of Mr Scindia's rivals.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Jyotiraditya Scindia", "Madhya Pradesh", "BJP", "Congress"], "tags": ["Deepshikha Ghosh", "Madhya Pradesh", "BJP", "Jyotiraditya Scindia"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Jyotiraditya Scindia is among the two candidates named by the BJP for the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.ndtv.com/static/images/logo_ndtv_touch_icon.png", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "Jyotiraditya Scindia,Madhya Pradesh,BJP,Congress", "description": "Jyotiraditya Scindia is among the two candidates named by the BJP for the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh.", "publish-date": "Wed, 11 Mar 2020 17:11:40 +0530", "created-date": "Wed, 11 Mar 2020 17:11:40 +0530", "modified-date": "Wed, 11 Mar 2020 17:11:47 +0530", "section": "india", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjp-names-jyotiraditya-scindia-for-rajya-sabha-shortly-after-he-joins-party-2193210", "keywords": "Jyotiraditya Scindia,Madhya Pradesh,BJP,Congress", "og": {"title": "BJP Names Jyotiraditya Scindia For Rajya Sabha Shortly After He Joins Party", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-03/sp5e5t8o_jyotiraditya-scindia-650-pti-new_650x400_10_March_20.jpg", "secure_url": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-03/sp5e5t8o_jyotiraditya-scindia-650-pti-new_650x400_10_March_20.jpg", "width": 630, "height": 473}, "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjp-names-jyotiraditya-scindia-for-rajya-sabha-shortly-after-he-joins-party-2193210", "site_name": "NDTV.com", "description": "Jyotiraditya Scindia is among the two candidates named by the BJP for the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh."}, "fb": {"app_id": 213741912058651}, "al": {"android": {"url": "ndtvSocial://com.july.ndtv/ndtv/ndtv.android/type=news/id=2193210/category=india-news", "package": "com.july.ndtv", "app_name": "NDTV"}, "ios": {"url": "ndtv://news/ndtv.com/news/view/ndtv/2193210/site=classic/", "app_store_id": 377869410, "app_name": "NDTV"}, "ipad": {"url": "ndtvhd://news/ndtv.com/news/view/ndtv/2193210/site=classic/", "app_store_id": 390847563, "app_name": "NDTV HD"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ndtv", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjp-names-jyotiraditya-scindia-for-rajya-sabha-shortly-after-he-joins-party-2193210", "title": "BJP Names Jyotiraditya Scindia For Rajya Sabha Shortly After He Joins Party", "description": "Jyotiraditya Scindia is among the two candidates named by the BJP for the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh.", "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-03/sp5e5t8o_jyotiraditya-scindia-650-pti-new_650x400_10_March_20.jpg?ver-20200203.4", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "ndtv://news/ndtv.com/news/view/ndtv/2193210/site=classic/", "googleplay": "ndtvnews://www.ndtv.com/type=news/id=2193210/category=india-news"}, "name": {"iphone": "NDTV", "ipad": "NDTV HD", "googleplay": "NDTV"}, "id": {"iphone": 377869410, "googleplay": "com.july.ndtv"}}}, "category": "News", "theme-color": "#e3eef9", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=377869410 , app-argument=ndtv://news/ndtv.com/news/view/ndtv/2193210/site=classic/", "taboola": {"title": "BJP Names Jyotiraditya Scindia For Rajya Sabha Shortly After He Joins Party"}, "oovvuu_article_id": 2193210}, "canonical_link": "https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjp-names-jyotiraditya-scindia-for-rajya-sabha-shortly-after-he-joins-party-2193210"}
