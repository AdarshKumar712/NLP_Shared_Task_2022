Residents and businesses in those counties can apply for low-interest disaster loans from SBA.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe historic flooding we experienced in February was more than anyone anticipated\u2014and more than anyone should have to recover from alone. The people and businesses in the path of the Pearl River are still recovering from the recent devastation and deserve a helping hand. Working with the U.S. Small Business Administration, I am committed to helping Mississippi businesses and communities get back on their feet and thrive,\u201d said Governor Tate Reeves.\n\nFor small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives, small businesses engaged in aquaculture and most private nonprofit organizations, the SBA offers Economic Injury Disaster Loans to help meet working capital needs caused by the disaster. Economic Injury Disaster Loan assistance is available regardless of whether the business suffered any physical property damage.\n\nApplicants may apply online using the Electronic Loan Application (ELA) via SBA\u2019s secure website at Disasterloan.sba.gov. Anyone applying through the website can also receive one-on-one assistance by calling the SBA helpdesk and speaking with a customer service representative.\n\nBusinesses and individuals may also obtain information and loan applications by calling the SBA\u2019s Customer Service Center at 1-800-659-2955 (1-800-877-8339 for the deaf and hard-of-hearing), or by emailing disastercustomerservice@sba.gov. Loan applications can also be downloaded at www.sba.gov.
