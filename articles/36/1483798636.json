was a kid, New Year\u2019s Eve night was one of my favorites. My parents and I would gather with one or two of my uncle\u2019s families. It was the only night of the year we could hang out until midnight. The evening was spent making confetti out of colored paper, getting our homemade noise-makers of pans and wooden ladles ready, and setting the stage so we could scream and yell the New Year into existence.\n\nThe television was always on, of course, bouncing between the various New Year\u2019s celebrations being covered on the networks. Anyone who was doing the same thing with their family this year may have been treated to Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen discussing a story about Cooper\u2019s mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, wondering if she was going to be asked who had the largest \u201ccock\u201d in Hollywood.\n\nOf course Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen are talking about \"who has the biggest cock in Hollywood\" live on #CNNNYE pic.twitter.com/7cwaMGBQ3W \u2014 Mark Dice (@MarkDice) January 1, 2020\n\nNo big deal, right? It\u2019s 2020. Old sensibilities are out and penis stories are in. Sorry, but no. That\u2019s not how this works. The constant virtue signaling by mainstream media prohibits us from dismissing when they decide inappropriate things are suddenly appropriate.\n\nAs Twitter celebrity Carpe Donktum noted, the hypocrisy at CNN, Cooper\u2019s home network, is thick.\n\nCNN: DECENCY IS UNDER ATTACK IN TRUMP'S AMERICA!! HIS VULGAR TWEETS ARE HURTING OUR CHILDREN. Also CNN: Let's swap cock stories on live television during New Years! \u2014 Carpe Donktum\ud83d\udd39 (@CarpeDonktum) January 1, 2020\n\nOne of the biggest threats of Cultural Marxism is taking things that are rightly considered inappropriate and normalizing them for children in modern society. Have most kids heard worse than, \u201cHe\u2019s not going to ask me who has the biggest cock in Hollywood, is he?\u201d Yes. Does that make it okay for Anderson Cooper to ask it live on CNN on New Year\u2019s Eve night. No. When we accept such things without objection, we\u2019re acknowledging that the Cultural Marxists have already won.\n\nRevelry is no excuse for retelling of adult stories on live television. Anderson Cooper stepped in it on this one, but we shouldn\u2019t expect anything from CNN. Not an apology. Not even an acknowledgement. We need to set a better tone for 2020.\n\nWe are currently forming the American Conservative Movement.
