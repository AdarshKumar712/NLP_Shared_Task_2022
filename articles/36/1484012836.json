I play guitar, keyboard, different percussion instruments including talking drum, \u201cSakara\u201d, \u201cOmele\u2019, \u201cKonga\u201d;. all these make African music stand out.\n\n\u201cI have passion for guitar, I see it as my baby and I cannot do without it.\n\n\u201cCouple of years ago, I was rated 69th best guitarists in the whole world,\u201d KSA, with original name, Chief Sunday Adeniyi Adegeye said\n\nHe continued: \u201cI decided to learn how to play guitar on my own and I bought my first guitar when I was 16 years old.\n\n\u201cI saved money and bought the guitar for myself.\n\n\u201cAll my family members did not want me to play music because they believed that musicians at that time were not serious people.\n\n\u201cEventually, when I bought the guitar I hid it under the staircase.\n\n\u201cI was afraid to tell anybody that I wanted to go into the city for music training where I would be exposed.\n\nLuckily for me, I chose my keys and my style of music which is known as \u201cJuju\u201d.\n\nJuju music is a fusion of traditional Yoruba vocal forms and percussion with Western rock and roll and KSA is acclaimed to be in the vanguard of the development and international popularisation of the genre.\n\nThe internationally renowned musician recalled how he played music with the late comedian, dramatist and actor, Moses Olaiya, popularly known by his stage name, \u201cBaba Sala\u201d.\n\n\u201cHardly do people know that Baba Sala was a musician. He played guitar, talking drum and his music was like that of IK Dairo.\n\n\u201cWhen he floated the Baba Sala Travelling Theatre, I was the one in charge of the music section,\u201d he said.\n\nKSA who disclosed that he had composed more than 3, 000 songs said all his songs were his favourite because \u201ceach of them serves a purpose\u201d.\n\nOn retirement, the Juju music maestro said he would play music till his death.\n\n\u201cI wanted to retire sometime ago, but my fans all over the world did not allow me.\n\n\u201cThey said if I retire, what will I be doing.\n\n\u201cJuju music is in my blood, I cannot retire from music, I can only retire from stage.\n\n\u201cEven at 100 years, God willing, I will still be singing,\u201d he said.\n\nKSA disclosed that he was working on a project of building a standard music school and a museum to document and preserve all genres of music, particularly the early ones.\n\n\u201cI have started building my own school and by the grace of God in few years, there will be something on ground for people to see.\n\n\u201cI did not study music anywhere and was not trained by anybody but I have passion for music.\n\n\u201cI look around the entire nation; we do not have a standard music school.\n\n\u201cMost of the Nigerian musicians of note are self made.\u201d\n\nKSA said the museum would archive all genres of Nigerian early music, images and relics of musicians for young ones like Onafuye to visit and study.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["guitar", "King Sunny Ade", "Temidara Onafuye"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 13:33:50 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/TEO-icon-55x55.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "theme-color": "#cc0000", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#cc0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "#cc0000", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "How I bought my first guitar at 16 \u2013 Sunny Ade", "site_name": "The Eagle Online", "description": "King Sunny Ade said he bought his first guitar when he was 16 years old with personal savings and hid", "url": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/how-i-bought-my-first-guitar-at-16-sunny-ade/", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_1718-1024x886-e1577885492692.jpg", "height": 519, "width": 600}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T13:33:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T13:33:50+00:00", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "Temidara Onafuye"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How I bought my first guitar at 16 \u2013 Sunny Ade", "description": "King Sunny Ade said he bought his first guitar when he was 16 years old with personal savings and hid", "url": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/how-i-bought-my-first-guitar-at-16-sunny-ade/", "image": {"src": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_1718-1024x886-e1577885492692.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 519}}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "fb": {"pages": 245777418823519}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/TEO-icon.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng"}
