You have woken up the entire country. We are here to thank you,\" Bhasker said and termed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act a \"targeted\" law.\n\nWhile Ayyub raised slogans 'Hum EK Hain' and 'Inquilab Zindabad', Bhasker recited lyricist Varun Grover's poem against the citizenship law which has the punchline 'Hum kaagaz nahi dikhayenge (We won't show documents)'.\n\nFollowing the public meeting, a candlelight march was organised by the alumni association of the university outside gate number 7, which has become a protest site after the December 15 violence. The students of Jamia welcomed the New year with cries of 'Inquilab Zindabad' and 'Azaadi'.\n\nThe sit-in protest by women at Shaheen Bagh continued after a night where they welcomed the new year by singing the national anthem and raising the slogan 'Azaadi'. Bhasker visited the protest site after addressing the gathering at Jamia Millia Islamia.\n\nAlmost 11 kilometres away at India Gate, slogans such as \"Hum kaagaz nahi dikhayenge\" and \"tanashahi nahin chalegi\" rent the air.\n\nThe number of protesters as well as visitors, who were out to celebrate the New Year on a sunny day, swelled around the iconic monument causing the traffic to virtually crawl in adjoining areas.\n\nCelebrating the new year by \"reading the preamble\", the protesters, including students from various universities, then took a pledge that they will \"not show any document\", referring to the planned National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).\n\nSeveral activists and artistes gathered at the Constitution Club of India under the aegis of Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (SAHMAT) and recited poems, sang songs and took part in plays to express their solidarity with people protesting the amended citizenship law.\n\nPinjraTod, a women's collective of students and alumni of colleges across Delhi, alleged that a march being carried out by women in Jaffrabad was halted by the police and RAF personnel, who even demanded their address proof.\n\nA senior police officer said the women were not halted or threatened but were told that prohibitory orders, banning the assembly of four or more persons, were in place following which they left the area.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Indian Muslims", "Universities in India", "Shaheen Bagh", "Jamia Millia Islamia", "Universities and colleges in India", "Delhi", "Okhla", "jamia millia islamia", "New Year's Day", "Varun Grover", "protest site", "lyricist", "civil society", "Swara Bhasker", "Nuclear Regulatory"], "tags": ["Social Issues"], "authors": ["Press Trust Of India"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Read more about Anti-CAA stir continues in Delhi on new year day; Swara Bhasker attends protest at Jamia on Business Standard.
