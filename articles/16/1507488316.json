Mr. Ghosn, who has denied the allegations, fled Japan on Dec. 29 and appeared before reporters in Lebanon on Jan. 8.\n\nMr. de Meo takes over after a tumultuous year at Renault that included an attempt to merge with Fiat Chrysler. The deal fell apart at the last minute. Fiat Chrysler has since agreed to merge with PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn cars.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jack Ewing", "Liz Alderman"], "publish_date": "Tue Jan 28 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Luca de Meo, a marketing specialist, will need to repair the French carmaker\u2019s troubled alliance with Nissan.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/vi-assets/static-assets/favicon-4bf96cb6a1093748bf5b3c429accb9b4.ico", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2020-01-28T17:40:20.307Z", "modified": "2020-01-28T17:40:20.307Z", "section": "Business", "tag": "France", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000006879307, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/1ce354cd-3204-56ab-a678-f5aaad9a3ecf", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/2754f9fc7ba641189af15380b971b290", "description": "Luca de Meo, a marketing specialist, will need to repair the French carmaker\u2019s troubled alliance with Nissan.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/14/business/00renaultceo/00renaultceo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Jack Ewing and Liz Alderman", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/14/business/00renaultceo/00renaultceo-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Cars,Appointments and Executive Changes,Nissan Motor,Renault,Volkswagen,,Jean-Dominique Senard,France", "pdate": 20200128, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/business/renault-ceo-luca-de-meo.html", "type": "article", "title": "Renault Chooses Volkswagen Executive as New C.E.O.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/14/business/00renaultceo/00renaultceo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Luca de Meo\u00a0recently stepped down as the president of SEAT, a Volkswagen division."}, "description": "Luca de Meo, a marketing specialist, will need to repair the French carmaker\u2019s troubled alliance with Nissan."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/business/renault-ceo-luca-de-meo.html", "title": "Renault Chooses Volkswagen Executive as New C.E.O.", "description": "Luca de Meo, a marketing specialist, will need to repair the French carmaker\u2019s troubled alliance with Nissan.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/14/business/00renaultceo/00renaultceo-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Luca de Meo\u00a0recently stepped down as the president of SEAT, a Volkswagen division."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/1ce354cd-3204-56ab-a678-f5aaad9a3ecf"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "business", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/business/renault-ceo-luca-de-meo.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/1ce354cd-3204-56ab-a678-f5aaad9a3ecf", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/business/renault-ceo-luca-de-meo.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/business/renault-ceo-luca-de-meo.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/business/renault-ceo-luca-de-meo.html"}
