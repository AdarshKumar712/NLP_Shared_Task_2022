parties to show leadership and generosity when talks to restore powersharing resume.\n\nSimon Coveney said the new year offered a chance for a new beginning and urged all sides not to disappoint the public again.\n\nNegotiations formally resume on Thursday after a pause for the festive period.\n\nMr Coveney and Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith were in Belfast on New Year\u2019s Day for pre-talks discussions ahead of the resumption of exchanges with the political parties on Thursday morning.\n\nThe parties have until a January 13 deadline to strike a deal to revive devolution.\n\nOn that date, legislation to give civil servants additional powers to run Northern Ireland\u2019s struggling public services expires and Mr Smith will assume a legal obligation to call a snap Assembly election.\n\nSimon Coveney (left) during a meeting with Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith last year (NIO/PA)\n\nOn the journey up to Belfast ahead of the new round of talks, Mr Coveney reflected on the importance of the coming fortnight.\n\nHe tweeted: \u201c2020 can be a new beginning for politics in NI with leadership & generosity from all sides \u2013 we\u2019ve got less than 2 weeks \u2013 let\u2019s not disappoint again! NEW YEAR, NEW BEGINNING!\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent New Year\u2019s Day video posted by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar outlining his government\u2019s priorities for 2020, Mr Coveney added: \u201cWe are determined to work with all of the parties in Northern Ireland to get the devolved government back up and running again, to get the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement functioning again, to bring communities together and to ensure that Northern Ireland can make decisions for itself.\u201d\n\nThe latest push to restore powersharing broke up the week before Christmas, with UK and Irish governments singling out the DUP as the party standing in the way of a deal.\n\nThe party rejected the claims, insisting it would not be \u201cbounced\u201d into a \u201cquick fix\u201d that falls apart when tested.\n\nDevolution can only be restored once the DUP and Sinn Fein \u2013 the region\u2019s two largest parties \u2013 agree terms to re-enter a mandatory coalition executive in Belfast.\n\nThe other three main parties \u2013 the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance \u2013 are also involved in the talks process convened by the UK and Irish governments.\n\nWhile they could take positions in any new executive, their sign-off on a deal is not essential and a government could be formed in their absence, with those parties having the option of going into opposition.\n\nQuiet road, on way back to #Belfast early morning for talks to get #Stormont working again. 2020 can be a new beginning for politics in NI with leadership & generosity from all sides - we\u2019ve got less than 2 weeks - let\u2019s not disappoint again! NEW YEAR, NEW BEGINNING! pic.twitter.com/FlYzoJ6X1W January 1, 2020\n\nExpectations of a breakthrough in the three-year powersharing impasse rose after the general election.\n\nThe DUP and Sinn Fein both suffered bruising results, with many interpreting the outcome as the public passing judgment on their failure to do a deal and providing a fresh incentive to do business.\n\nHowever, proposals to reform a contentious cross-community voting mechanism in the Assembly have emerged as a key sticking point in efforts to finalise an agreement, with the DUP unhappy about what is being countenanced.\n\nThe DUP is also seeking changes to ensure the devolved institutions are more stable in future and cannot be readily pulled down.\n\nProposed legislative protections for Irish language speakers are another crucial element of the negotiations.\n\nThe Stormont parties are also seeking a firm commitment from the UK government on a financial package to accompany the return of devolution \u2013 money that would likely be targeted at the region\u2019s crisis-hit health service.\n\nThe leaders of the DUP and Sinn Fein used their respective New Year messages to restate a desire to return to government.\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster has insisted her party is up for a \u201cfair and balanced deal\u201d (Liam McBurney/PA)\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster said it must be a decade of \u201cdecision rather than dithering\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe talks will recommence on Thursday,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe will be there and stand ready to restore devolution through a fair and balanced deal. A Northern Ireland that is going to keeping moving forward must be one where everyone feels at home but must also be one where no-one feels their culture is being marginalised.\u201d\n\nWhile Ms Foster warned that a focus on a potential border poll would lead to a \u201cwasted decade\u201d, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald insisted a united Ireland was within reach.\n\nBut the republican leader added: \u201cThere is no contradiction in working for Irish unity and working for the restoration of the Executive and Assembly \u2013 they are all part of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n\u201cWe have spent three years searching for agreement to re-establish the north\u2019s institutions and we got there in February 2018, but the DUP walked away from that deal. We cannot have that scenario again \u2013 the choice is now for agreement, or elections, but the current situation cannot continue.\n\n\u201cIt is in the interests of all our people that we establish good government and real power-sharing based on equality and respect.\n\n\u201cThe outstanding issues can be resolved. The time for acrimony and division is over. The time for slogans and soundbites is over. The test now for every party that has talked up getting back to work is to go back to the Executive table and deliver.\u201d\n\nMary Lou McDonald says the time for \u201cslogans and soundbites is over\u201d (Niall Carson/PA)\n\nStormont imploded three years ago this month when the late Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned in protest at the DUP\u2019s handling of a botched green energy scheme.\n\nThat dispute soon widened to encompass traditional rifts over issues such as the Irish language and the toxic legacy of the Troubles.\n\nA logjam over proposals to reform the petition of concern voting mechanism was one of the main reasons a deal failed to materialise before Christmas.\n\nIt was designed to protect minority rights but politicians have accused each other of misusing it for their own ends.\n\nDiscussions around change surround making it more difficult for one party to use the petition to block controversial legislation.\n\nThe parties are also considering amending Assembly rules to make it harder to collapse the institutions.\n\nPA", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["belfasttelegraph"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Ireland\u2019s deputy premier has urged Stormont\u2019s rowing parties to show leadership and generosity when talks to restore powersharing resume.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn-02.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/static/65878e062b4890b48f61c325264e809c8a5eee53/img/favicon-belfasttelegraph.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "belfasttelegraph", "description": "Ireland\u2019s deputy premier has urged Stormont\u2019s rowing parties to show leadership and generosity when talks to restore powersharing resume.", "news_keywords": "Simon Coveney urges all sides in Stormont talks to show generosity - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk", "og": {"title": "Simon Coveney urges all sides in Stormont talks to show generosity - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk", "site_name": "BelfastTelegraph.co.uk", "description": "Ireland\u2019s deputy premier has urged Stormont\u2019s rowing parties to show leadership and generosity when talks to restore powersharing resume.", "url": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/simon-coveney-urges-all-sides-in-stormont-talks-to-show-generosity-38826946.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/8da34/38826941.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/bpanews_47568884-daa9-4d5a-b55d-e53d797dc62c_1", "width": 608, "height": 342}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@BelTel", "url": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/simon-coveney-urges-all-sides-in-stormont-talks-to-show-generosity-38826946.html", "title": "Simon Coveney urges all sides in Stormont talks to show generosity", "description": "Ireland\u2019s deputy premier has urged Stormont\u2019s rowing parties to show leadership and generosity when talks to restore powersharing resume.", "image": {"src": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/8da34/38826941.ece/ALTERNATES/w135square/bpanews_47568884-daa9-4d5a-b55d-e53d797dc62c_1"}, "domain": "BelfastTelegraph.co.uk"}, "published-date": "Wed, 01 Jan 2020 15:42:36 GMT", "fb": {"app_id": 321217294648139}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1229633020, app-argument=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/simon-coveney-urges-all-sides-in-stormont-talks-to-show-generosity-38826946.html"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/simon-coveney-urges-all-sides-in-stormont-talks-to-show-generosity-38826946.html"}
