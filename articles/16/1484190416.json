glamour in a velvet burgundy gown adorned with diamonds and rubies as she attended her family's traditional New Year reception at Amalienborg Palace in her country's capital.\n\nShe joined her sister-in-law Princess Marie, 43, her aunt-in-law Princess Benedikte, 75, and her mother-in-law Queen Margrethe II, 79, in celebrating the new year.\n\nThe women put on a jaw-dropping display, kitted out in eye-catching diamond tiaras, ruby and pearl necklaces and emerald jewels.\n\nMary's velvet gown, cut with long sleeves to shield the Australian-born princess from the cold, fitted her lean frame perfectly.\n\nWith her usual impeccable taste, Mary paired the stylish gown with lavish jewellery - a ruby necklace and earrings adorned with generous diamond clusters, and a stunning matching tiara and bracelet.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nPrincess Mary looked stunning in a burgundy gown as the Danish royal family hosted their traditional New Year's reception at Amalienborg Palace in

also adorned with a floral brooch with rubies, as was a beautiful ring on her right hand.\n\nAs per tradition, she also sported the Order of the Elephant at the front and centre of the stylish outfit.\n\nThe Order is Denmark\u2019s oldest and most distinguished royal order of chivalry, and can be dated back to 1460.\n\nWhile the length of her gown covered her whole height down to the pavement of the palace, the royal's step revealed she was wearing shoes of the same colour as the gown.\n\nHer red clutch bag added a pop of colour to the eye-catching ensemble as she posed for pictures before retreating inside.\n\nNot one to overdo it, Mary kept her hazelnut locks styled in a simple bun, and sported light makeup that put the emphasis on her deep sea blue eyes with a dash of mascara and dark eye-shadow.\n\nQueen Margrethe II, 79, wore a floral gown in aquamarine and a sumptuous fur thrown over her shoulders. Her emerald jewellery shone as much as she beamed this evening\n\nPrincess Benedikte, 75, the younger sister of the reigning Queen of Denmark, Margrethe II, added some glitz to her purple gown with a pair of heels, and stuck to silver jewellery and pearls\n\nWith her usual impeccable taste, the Danish royal paired her jewellery to her dress, from her beautiful tiara and earrings to her necklace, bracelets and ring (pictured)\n\nMary's sister in law, Princess Marie, the wife of Prince Joachim, 50, also looked a picture in a navy blue number with an empire cut.\n\nAlso sporting the order of the elephant, the royal sported sapphire jewellery which matched her gown perfectly.\n\nQueen Margrethe II, 79, the mother of Mary's husband, Frederik, 51, sported a lovely aquamarine gown with a fur thrown over her shoulders.\n\nShe paired the delightful number with emerald gems on her tiara, necklace and bracelet.\n\nHer younger sister, Princess Benedikte, 75, sporting purple, stuck to silver jewellery adorned with purple to accessorise her outfit.\n\nCrown Princess Mary turned heads in the beautiful gown as its eye-cathing train wrapped her legs in the velvet fabric (pictured)\n\nSequins and pearls!

Princess Marie and Prince Joachim held hands as they stopped for a few moments on the red carpet leading them into the royal party\n\nBoth royals were smiling, wearing their very best ahead of the evening of celebration in Copenhagen. Joachim and Marie (pictured) married in 2008\n\nThe traditional New Year's Eve ball began in 1693 when Christian VII gave the Elephant Order statues to the Danish Ordinances on January 1.\n\nWhile it used to be an exclusive celebration for kings and knights of the day, the circle later extended to include royal ladies, the cabinet's leadership and selected institutions closely related to the empire.\n\nIt has since become a way for the reigning Queen to give a New Year's address to her family and close associates.\n\nPrincess Mary kept her makeup subtle, with a dash of mascara and eyeshadow which put the emphasis on her deep sea blue eyes\n\nQueen Margrethe II (left) beamed in aquamarine as she was joined by her younger sister Benedikte, in purple, (right) for the festivities", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["dailymail", "femail", "Royals"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Claire Toureille", "Claire Toureille For Mailonline"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 20:20:34 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, 47, looked stunning in a burgundy gown as she hosted the Danish royal family's annual New Year reception at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico?v=2", "meta_data": {"keywords": "dailymail,femail,Royals", "news_keywords": "dailymail,femail,Royals", "original-source": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7843289/Crown-Princess-Mary-Denmark-stuns-Danish-royal-family-host-New-Year-reception.html", "description": "Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, 47, looked stunning in a burgundy gown as she hosted the Danish royal family's annual New Year reception at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen.", "channel": "Lifestyle,Femail", "doc-class": "Living Document", "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "twitter": {"account_id": 15438913, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Crown Princess Mary of Denmark hosts royal family New Year reception", "description": "Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, 47, looked stunning in a burgundy gown as she hosted the Danish royal family's annual New Year reception at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7843289/Crown-Princess-Mary-Denmark-stuns-Danish-royal-family-host-New-Year-reception.html", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/01/01/20/22886562-0-image-a-99_1577910688845.jpg", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 384101264, "ipad": 400442503}}}, "articleid": 7843289, "author": "Claire Toureille", "divclasspage": "articlePage", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "googlebot": "max-image-preview:large", "mol": {"headline": "A dazzling trio!
