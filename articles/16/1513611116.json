first time, sending shockwaves to Berlin.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s centre-right CDU party immediately called for fresh regional elections as a way out of the crisis, a call echoed by other mainstream parties.\n\nThomas Kemmerich, a politician from the economically liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), was elected as state premier after lawmakers from the far-right AfD gave him their backing.\n\nAs a result, Kemmerich beat incumbent Bodo Ramelow of the Left party 45 to 44.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in the history of modern Germany that a state premier has been elected with AfD votes,\u201d political scientist Andre Brodocz told broadcaster MDR.\n\nWhile the ballot was secret, Kemmerich must have also had support from CDU MPs, as well as his FDP stablemates.\n\nMedia were quick to describe the event as a \u201cpolitical earthquake\u201d, as mainstream parties had so far refused to countenance working with anti-immigration, anti-minority and anti-EU AfD at any level. \u2014 AFP\n\nRelated", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Feb  5 18:41:10 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description":
