Ward spent all but one season of his 14-year NHL career with Carolina, so the decision to retire with the Hurricanes came as little surprise. While he never was able to become one of the elite goalies like it looked like he\u2019d be following his Conn Smythe-worthy performance in his rookie season to help lead the Hurricanes to the Stanley Cup, he still carved out a solid career for himself, playing in 701 games between Carolina and Chicago. Ward is the franchise leader in several categories for goaltenders (including games played, wins, and saves to name a few) and will continue to hold those marks for a long time to come.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 22:41:02 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "After being unable to find a contract in free agency, veteran goaltender Cam Ward decided to call it a career but only after signing a one-day contract to retire as a member of the Hurricanes.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png?v=2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "After being unable to find a contract in free agency, veteran goaltender Cam Ward decided to call it a career but only after signing a one-day contract to retire as a member of the Hurricanes.", "fb": {"app_id": 125075807517358}, "og": {"title": "2019 year in review: August", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.yardbarker.com/nhl/articles/2019_year_in_review_august/s1_14825_30943364", "image": "https://www.yardbarker.com/media/e/f/efa32ef9f47a246508c9606f99b75404503cab8d/thumb_16x9/13753647.jpg?v=1", "description": "After being unable to find a contract in free agency, veteran goaltender Cam Ward decided to call it a career but only after signing a one-day contract to retire as a member of the Hurricanes.", "site_name": "Yardbarker"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T22:41:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T22:41:02-05:00", "section": "Sports", "tag": "Bill Guerin,Colin White,Edmonton Oilers,Jesse Puljujarvi,Kevin Shattenkirk,Minnesota Wild,Ottawa Senators,Tampa Bay Lightning,NHL"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@yardbarker", "title": "2019 year in review: August", "description": "After being unable to find a contract in free agency, veteran goaltender Cam Ward decided to call it a career but only after signing a one-day contract to retire as a member of the Hurricanes.", "image": "https://www.yardbarker.com/media/e/f/efa32ef9f47a246508c9606f99b75404503cab8d/thumb_16x9/13753647.jpg?v=1"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.prohockeyrumors.com/2020/01/2019-year-in-review-august.html"}
