That\u2019s according to the results of a new study.\n\nBy analysing coronavirus fatalities in 66 administrative regions in Italy, Spain, France and Germany, scientists found that of the 4,443 deaths, 3,487 were in five regions in northern Italy and central Spain.\n\nData shows these regions \u2013 which include the cities of Milan, Bologna, Turin, Venice and Madrid \u2013 are main nitrogen dioxide hotspots over Europe. The combination of pollution, surrounding mountain ranges and weather conditions make it difficult for dirty air to disperse from urban areas.\n\n\u2018Important contributors to fatality\u2019\n\nYaron Ogen, a researcher at the Martin Luther University in Germany, said: \u201cThese results indicate that the long-term exposure to this pollutant may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the COVID-19 virus in these regions and maybe across the whole world.\u201d\n\nEarlier studies showed that exposure to nitrogen dioxide causes inflammation in the lungs. This latest research suggests that topography and atmospheric conditions could also play a part in the death rate.\n\nOgen continued: \u201cPoisoning our environment means poisoning our own body and when it experiences a chronic respiratory stress, its ability to defend itself from infections is limited.\u201d\n\n\u2018This new study is worrying\u2019\n\nJenny Bates, an air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, told the Guardian: \u201cThis new study is worrying. We know nitrogen dioxide is a toxic gas that inflames the lining of the lungs and reduces immunity to lung infections, so it may not be surprising that people who have suffered in areas with high levels of nitrogen dioxide could be more susceptible to coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThis is all the more reason to keep traffic and pollution levels down as much as possible now and get out of this terrible situation with a view to fewer but cleaner vehicles on the road.\u201d\n\nThese findings are backed by similar studies across the world. Research in the United States suggests COVID-19 death rates increase by around 15 percent in areas with even a small increase in fine-particle pollution levels.\n\nAir pollution in the UK has dropped dramatically since lockdown measures were enforced in March. Some cities have seen a 60 percent fall in airborne nitrogen dioxide.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Coronavirus", "Car News", "pollution"], "authors": ["Gavin Braithwaite-Smith"], "publish_date": "Tue Apr 21 09:32:51 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A new study suggests that air pollution \u2018may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the COVID-19\u2018 virus in Europe.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.motoringresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MR-logo-square-minimised.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A new study suggests that air pollution \u2018may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the COVID-19\u2018 virus in Europe.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Air pollution linked to COVID-19 deaths in Europe | Motoring Research", "description": "A new study suggests that air pollution \u2018may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the COVID-19\u2018 virus in Europe.", "url": "https://www.motoringresearch.com/car-news/air-pollution-linked-covid-19-deaths/", "site_name": "Motoring Research", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.motoringresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Air-pollution-in-Turin.jpg", "width": 1920, "height": 1080}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MotoringResearch", "published_time": "2020-04-21T09:32:51+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@majorgav", "site": "@editorial_mr"}, "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.10.0", "google-site-verification": "CCSzTEBc8EePFWyU0SSJ6GLozN-eC49NYqThbYD4cU8", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.motoringresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MR_favicon_96_96.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.motoringresearch.com/car-news/air-pollution-linked-covid-19-deaths/"}
