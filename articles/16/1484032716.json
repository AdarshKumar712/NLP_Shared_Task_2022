Aside from providing support for his center-backs, the 20-year-old was exceptional as an attacking force down the right.\n\nBrighton's Dan Burn will not want to face him too soon having left the pitch holding his arm in the 22nd minute following a collision with the England under-21 player.\n\nThe Blues, however, were as poor as Brighton in attack, and keeper Mat Ryan had less to do than his opposite number. The only time he was called into action in the second half was to make a routine low save from Christian Pulisic.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "http://www.iran-daily.com/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"generator": "Tarnama Portal 4.0"}, "canonical_link": ""}
