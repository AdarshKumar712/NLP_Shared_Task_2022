The technique of creating colorful patterns with a wax resist is called pysanky, and it came to the United States with the \u00e9migr\u00e9s of the Ukraine in the diaspora that began just before WWI. The cultural traditions took root here and in Canada, and were passed through to the current generation.\n\nShannon Wallis is from the Upper Valley, not the Ukraine, but nevertheless enjoys the patterns and colors of the pysanky technique. She often runs into folks who know the history and recognize the regional patterns on her eggs \u2014 the patterns she first used to learn the process.\n\nFind It\n\nshannonwallisdesigns.square.site\n\nfacebook.com/shannonwallisdesigns\n\nInstagram @shannon_w_designs\n\n(603) 306-2281 Instagram @shannon_w_designs(603) 306-2281\n\nAfter eight years of developing her style, Wallis created her own language of design elements that goes beyond the traditional. She sees patterns everywhere \u2014 on someone\u2019s dress, in a Hindi henna tattoo or flowers. Wallis says it\u2019s a challenge creating two-dimensional geometric designs with squares and triangles that skirt a conical egg, but therein lies the satisfaction.\n\nStarting with a raw chicken or duck egg, Wallis draws on the first layer of design with a kistka filled with flowing hot wax. Wallis says the method is like creating a coloring book \u2014 first she draws the lines in wax and then colors in between with dyes. Finally, all the wax is removed with a few seconds in a microwave, and the design is revealed. That is her favorite moment \u2014 is it a masterpiece or a mess? The finished eggs are \u201cblown out\u201d to preserve them.\n\nLately, she has been experimenting with brown eggs that are first \u201cetched\u201d with vinegar in spots to create whites lines, revealed under the brown surface. The colors used may be the only seasonal element to her designs, as she sells the most eggs in December as hanging ornaments.\n\nBut Easter is the traditional time for egg dyeing throughout history and cultures. Wallis may not have a Ukrainian heritage for design inspiration, but she has gathered dozens of \u201cegg friends\u201d all over the world on social media. She\u2019s also been invited to participate in a show at the Pysanka Museum in Kolomyia, Ukraine, in April to bring back to the homeland variations of the technique that took root in America and Canada over the past 100 years. As a side note, she says that the most respected egg artist in the Ukraine is a soldier fighting, at the moment, against the Russian aggression.\n\nWhen Wallis gets around to having her DNA tested, she almost hopes there is a percentage from Eastern Europe. That would explain a lot of things.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Mar 18 19:14:04 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.nhmagazine.com/content/uploads/2018/12/android-chrome-256x256.png", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.nhmagazine.com/content/themes/gtxcel/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "theme-color": "#121212", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Artist Shannon Wallis - New Hampshire Magazine", "description": "Wallis turns eggs into works of art using a hot wax pen and an array of geometric designs.", "url": "https://www.nhmagazine.com/artist-shannon-wallis/", "site_name": "New Hampshire Magazine", "image": {"identifier": "https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.nhmagazine.com/content/uploads/2020/03/artisan-april-1024x1024.jpg", "secure_url": "https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.nhmagazine.com/content/uploads/2020/03/artisan-april-1024x1024.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 1024}}, "article": {"section": "Arts & Shopping", "published_time": "2020-03-18T19:14:04+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Wallis turns eggs into works of art using a hot wax pen and an array of geometric designs.", "title": "Artist Shannon Wallis - New Hampshire Magazine", "image": "https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.nhmagazine.com/content/uploads/2020/03/artisan-april.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 277927835600543}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.nhmagazine.com/artist-shannon-wallis/"}
