U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 21 cents, or 0.3%, at $61.27 per barrel.\n\nOil markets were closed on Wednesday for New Year's Day.\n\nBoth benchmarks ended higher in 2019, posting their biggest annual gains since 2016, buoyed at the end of the year by a thaw in the prolonged trade dispute between the United States and China - the world's two largest economies - and a deeper output cut pledged by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies.\n\n\"Oil remains supported by the back-burner trade truce and the uptick in political unrest in Iraq,\" said Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategist at AxiTrader.\n\nGeopolitical risks remain in the Middle East after U.S air strikes against the Iran-backed Katib Hezbollah militia group over the weekend. Protesters, angry at the air strikes, stormed the U.S.\n\nEmbassy in Baghdad on Wednesday, although they withdrew after U.S. deployed extra troops.\n\nIn 2020, Brent is forecast to average $63.07 a barrel, up from December's estimate of $62.50, while WTI is forecast to average $57.70 a barrel, up from December's estimate of $57.30, as the OPEC-led supply cuts and the expectations of a U.S.-China trade deal boosted analysts' views on the prospects for the year, a Reuters poll showed.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House.\n\nJanuary also marks the start of the deeper output cuts by OPEC and its partners, including Russia.\n\nOPEC and its allies have agreed to cut a further of 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1, on top of their previous cut of 1.2 million bpd that started on Jan. 1 a year ago.\n\nA fall in U.S. crude inventories last week also supported prices. U.S. crude inventories fell by 7.8 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 27, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 3.2 million barrels, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) released on Tuesday.\n\nOfficial data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due on Friday as the release has been delayed by two days by the New Year's holiday. - Reuters", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Local Counsel", "My View", "Policy Matters", "Another Take", "Off The Cuff", "On The Other Hand", "Freespace", "Just Different", "Law Speak", "Speaking From The Heart", "Making Sens"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "SEOUL: Oil prices rose on the first trading day of 2020 as warming trade relations between the United States and China eased demand concerns, and risi...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thesundaily.my/base-portlet/webrsrc/ctxvar/8d59900f-08ec-4018-8768-dc251cb30624.png", "meta_data": {"description": "SEOUL: Oil prices rose on the first trading day of 2020 as warming trade relations between the United States and China eased demand concerns, and risi...", "og": {"title": "Oil climbs on U.S.-China trade optimism, Middle East tensions", "description": "SEOUL: Oil prices rose on the first trading day of 2020 as warming trade relations between the United States and China eased demand concerns, and risi...", "image": "https://www.thesundaily.my/binrepository/480x320/0c35/480d250/none/11808/SFXJ/oil-refinery-reuters_871980_20200102103420.jpg", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.thesundaily.my/business/oil-climbs-on-u-s-china-trade-optimism-middle-east-tensions-DJ1847173", "site_name": "www.thesundaily.my"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "viewport": "width=device-width", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theSundaily"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thesundaily.my/business/oil-climbs-on-u-s-china-trade-optimism-middle-east-tensions-DJ1847173"}
