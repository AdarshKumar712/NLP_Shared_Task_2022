I feel pretty good about it.\u201d\n\nStafford missed his eighth straight game Sunday when the Lions closed the season with a ninth consecutive loss, dropping them to 3-12-1 for their worst season in a decade.\n\nDetroit drafted him No. 1 overall in 2009. After his career began with a pair of injury-shortened seasons, he didn\u2019t miss a game for eighth straight seasons before back and hip ailments limited him to eight games this year.\n\nThe Lions still have a lot invested in Stafford with a $135 million deal that keeps him under contract through 2022 and say they\u2019re very confident he will not have lingering health problems\n\n\u201cNo issues there,\u201d general manager Bob Quinn said.\n\nLET\u2019S MAKE A DEAL\n\nKenny Golladay was a bright spot during a dismal season, leading the league with 11 receiving touchdowns in his third season. The receiver has one year left on his deal and said he\u2019s open to signing a long-term contract extension.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already expressed I\u2019m open to it,\u201d he said.\n\nSTAY OR GO\n\nOffensive guard Graham Glasgow has started 58 games since Detroit drafted him out of Michigan in the third round three years ago. Glasgow may be worth more on the open market as a free agent than the Lions are willing to pay him.\n\n\u201cI would like to feel like I\u2019m wanted,\u201d he acknowledged.\n\nThe Lions will likely want to bring back 34-year-old wide receiver Danny Amendola, who had one of his best seasons, instead of letting him go in free agency. They may let defensive tackle A\u2019Shawn Robinson hit the market because he has not lived up to expectations as the 46th pick overall in 2016.\n\nSEE YA, SNACKS?\n\nDamon \u201cSnacks\u201d Harrison said after Sunday\u2019s 23-20 loss to Green Bay he\u2019s pondering retirement. The 31-year-old defensive tackle expressed frustrations that injuries affected his play. Harrison signed an $11 million, one-year extension last summer, putting him under contract through the 2021 season.\n\nNO REGRETS\n\nQuinn made an in-season trade for the second straight season that did not work out well for the franchise. He sent safety Quandre Diggs, a captain, to Seattle for a fifth-round pick. While Diggs flourished for the Seahawks, the Lions failed to replace him.\n\nDoes Quinn have any regrets about the decision?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he insisted.\n\nLast year, the Lions traded receiver Golden Tate to Philadelphia for a third-round pick. The move appeared to hurt the team\u2019s morale and ability to move the ball on offense.\n\nHOW TO GET IT RIGHT\n\nQuinn and Patricia will be in win-now mode more than ever next year, trying to also stick around for 2021, after ownership decided earlier this month to retain them.\n\n\u201cObviously, we need to win next year,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI understand that.\u201d\n\nEntering his fifth season in charge of the front office, Quinn insisted he won\u2019t sacrifice the future with short-sighted decisions just to improve his job security.\n\n\u201cYou always have to have your lens on the short term and the long term, and that\u2019s not going to change,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Lions can\u2019t miss on a difference-making player, likely on defense, with the No. 3 pick overall. Detroit\u2019s defense dipped to 31st in the NFL this season after ranking 10th overall last year.\n\nDefensive end Trey Flowers proved to be a good free-agent signing, but he needs a lot of help on the defensive line.\n\nIf the team chooses to trade three-time Pro Bowler Darius Slay with one year and $10 million left on his deal instead of giving him a contract extension, it will need to sign a free agent cornerback or invest a high draft pick to bolster the position.\n\nThe Lions will probably want to start the 2020 season with a good option to back up Stafford after finding out they can\u2019t win without him if they\u2019re left with veteran castoffs or a rookie.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Associated Press.
