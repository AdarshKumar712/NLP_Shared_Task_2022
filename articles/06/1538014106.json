(Representational Image)\n\nThe UK government has reiterated its concern over the potential impact of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and said it is continuing to follow the events in India closely.\n\nIn response to an urgent question on \u201cRecent Violence in India\u201d tabled by Pakistani-origin Opposition Labour Party MP Khalid Mahmood in the House of Commons on Tuesday, UK\u2019s Minister of State in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Nigel Adams said the UK engages with India at all levels, including on human rights, and also referred to the country\u2019s \u201cproud history\u201d of inclusive government and religious tolerance.\n\n\u201cThe UK government also have concerns about the potential impact of the legislation (CAA),\u201d said Adams, the Minister for Asia who was standing in for UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is on a visit to Turkey.\n\n\u201cIt is because of our close relationship with the government of India that we are able to discuss difficult issues with them and make clear our concerns where we have them, including on the rights of minorities. We will continue to follow events closely and to raise our concerns when we have with them,\u201d said the minister.\n\nWhile Mahmood, who had tabled the urgent question for an FCO statement, described the government response as \u201cfacile\u201d, another Pakistani-origin MP Nusrat Ghani called on the government to relay the UK Parliament\u2019s concerns to the Indian authorities.\n\nBritish Sikh Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi said the violence had brought back \u201cpainful personal memories\u201d from the 1984 Sikh riots while he was studying in India and fellow Sikh MP Preet Kaur Gill also referenced 1984 in her intervention.\n\nOther MPs sought to highlight the steps taken by the Indian authorities to restore \u201cpeace and tranquillity\u201d in Delhi.\n\n\u201cHe will be aware that it is not just Muslims who have been killed; Hindus have also been killed as part of the riots,\u201d said Conservative Party MP Bob Blackman.\n\nScottish National Party (SNP) MP Alyn Smith sought the UK government\u2019s intervention to share best practice around countering the online disinformation campaign being used in India to \u201cinflame tensions\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are in constant contact on these issues, and we know how important this is to Members of Parliament and their constituents, who may have family in the area,\u201d said Adams, in his response.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
