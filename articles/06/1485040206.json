Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) caused a few chuckles on Thursday when he asked President Donald Trump\u2019s handlers to direct him to an editorial in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn a tweet sent on Thursday morning, Grassley wrote: \u201cWhoever keeps watch on [Donald Trump] at WH have the economist there especially Navarro read WSJ oped by Henninger.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve been preaching to the President for two [years]./President [would] benefit [from] reading it / IN TURN USA BENEFITS.\u201d\n\nWhoever keeps watch on @realDonaldTrump at WH have the economist there especially Navarro read WSJ oped by Henninger This is what I\u2019ve been preaching to the President for two yrs./President wld benefit fr reading it / IN TURN USA BENEFITS \u2014 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) January 2, 2020\n\nGrassley appears to be talking about a column by The Wall Street Journal editorial writer Daniel Henninger.\n\nHenninger\u2019s most recent column, titled \u201cWill the \u201920s Roar Again?\u201d addresses economic issues and praised tax cuts.\n\nIn the piece, Henninger declared that, because of Trump\u2019s tax cuts, \u201cthe consumer is again king.\u201d He also criticized tariffs but, largely, the column spoke on about how wonderful everybody was in the 1920s.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even the first time that Grassley has tweeted at Trump, hoping to get him to read something. In early 2017, he made it a bit of a habit, though, at the time, he wasn\u2019t tagging the president in his tweets.\n\nIn February of 2017, Grassley tweeted at \u201cwhoever monitors twitter at WH for President Trump\u201d and called for the president to \u201cstart declassifying.\u201d\n\nWhoever monitors twitter at WH for Pres Trump get on subject of my immediate tweet and stop overclassification & start declassifying \u2014 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) February 11, 2017\n\nOn the next day, the Iowa senator sent out a tweet asking when the White House would be open for public tours and saying that his wife wanted to know. That was during the usual period just after the inauguration in which the White House is closed to the public.\n\nWhoever monitors twitter at WH for businessman president Trump \"when is WH going to be opened for public tours?\" Mrs G wants to know \u2014 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) February 12, 2017\n\nBut Grassley probably would have had better luck in getting the president\u2019s attention if he appeared on Fox News. On Thursday, around the same time that Grassley was tweeting at him, Trump was tweeting at his favorite network and complaining about impeachment.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Chuck Grassley", "donald trump", "Donald Trump\u2019s"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 18:03:07 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley took his presidential advice to Twitter on Thursday, tweeting at the president in hopes that he would read a WSJ op-ed.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, height=device-height, width=device-width", "description": "Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley took his presidential advice to Twitter on Thursday, tweeting at the president in hopes that he would read a WSJ op-ed.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "GOP Senator Asks Trump\u2019s Handlers to Have Him Read The Wall Street Journal", "description": "Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley took his presidential advice to Twitter on Thursday, tweeting at the president in hopes that he would read a WSJ op-ed.", "url": "https://ijr.com/chuck-grassley-trump-wall-street-journal/", "site_name": "IJR", "updated_time": "2020-01-02T18:03:19+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://mk0independentjhwk3g.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-07-23T143854Z_1_LYNXNPEF6M13V_RTROPTP_4_USA-CONGRESS.jpg", "secure_url": "https://mk0independentjhwk3g.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-07-23T143854Z_1_LYNXNPEF6M13V_RTROPTP_4_USA-CONGRESS.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 800}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theijr", "author": "https://ijr.com/members/alexthomas/", "tag": "donald trump", "section": "IJR", "published_time": "2020-01-02T18:03:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T18:03:19+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1512567669058542, "pages": 211390269351416}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley took his presidential advice to Twitter on Thursday, tweeting at the president in hopes that he would read a WSJ op-ed.", "title": "GOP Senator Asks Trump\u2019s Handlers to Have Him Read The Wall Street Journal", "image": "https://mk0independentjhwk3g.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-07-23T143854Z_1_LYNXNPEF6M13V_RTROPTP_4_USA-CONGRESS.jpg", "creator": "@AlexThomasDC"}, "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:2285ce93e6013b8ea9e99cbff170f96f4d5588f9|ver:2.9.5|site:9968|unit:5573|width:662|height:372|autoplay:0|aspect:1|user_id:11278|default_channel:122|visual:1|ovr_def:1|async_embed:1|player:12036|unit_width:480|unit_height:270|video_image:|widget:1|channels:Array|google_seo:0", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://ijr.com/chuck-grassley-trump-wall-street-journal/?ia_markup=1"}, "google-site-verification": "uXik397WXD1LEh1PR6jecW_xsQ0UGE4Q8uWkQ8TS5P4", "g1": {"switch-skin-css": "https://mk0independentjhwk3g.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/themes/ijr/css/7.6.1/styles/mode-dark.min.css"}}, "canonical_link": "https://ijr.com/chuck-grassley-trump-wall-street-journal/"}
