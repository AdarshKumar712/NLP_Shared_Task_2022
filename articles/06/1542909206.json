Japan also, according to sources, has expressed confidence that India will be able to manage the situation, keeping in mind the strong economic ties and the large presence of Japanese professionals working on projects in India.The Indian embassy in Tokyo , and also the consulate in Osaka , has assured locals that they will continue to facilitate essential visits including those for business and employment through a ``revised visa process\u2019\u2019 made available on its website. In a tweet, the Indian embassy requested understanding of visa seekers, keeping in mind the Covid-19 situation.There are as many as 1441 Japanese countries currently doing business in India. Japan is also India\u2019s most important development partner which continues to contribute enormously to socio-economic development in India.The Indian side too is aware that visa restrictions imposed on Japanese individuals can delay work even on flagship projects like the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train which is currently hard-pressed to meet its 2023 deadline.Japan though has been upset that it was clubbed with countries like South Korea, Iran and Italy by India in cancelling e-visas for people from infected countries. Japan has reported over 1150 cases of Covid-19 but almost 700 of these are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Yokohama. The number of locally infected cases is around 450 only while in Iran, Italy and South Korea it runs into thousands.According to MEA, Japan has been extending bilateral loan and grant assistance to India since 1958 and is the largest bilateral donor for India. Japanese ODA supports India\u2019s efforts for accelerated economic development particularly in priority areas like power, transportation, environmental projects and projects related to basic human needs. Japan\u2019s ODA Commitment in 2018-19 was at an all-time high of JPY 522.405 billion.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["India", "India news", "India news today", "Today news", "Google news", "Breaking news", "Tokyo", "South Korea", "Osaka", "japan", "Italy", "Iran"], "tags": ["Supreme Court", "Osaka", "UIDAI", "ISRO news", "Indian Army", "Lok Sabha", "Congress", "Japan", "BJP news", "Italy", "South Korea", "Tokyo", "Iran"], "authors": ["Tnn"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "India News: After Japan's strong demarche, India has assured Japan that the visa restrictions won't come in the way of essential travels including business-relate.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "India News: After Japan's strong demarche, India has assured Japan that the visa restrictions won't come in the way of essential travels including business-relate.", "keywords": "India, India news, India news today, Today news, Google news, Breaking news,Tokyo,South Korea,Osaka,japan,Italy,Iran", "robots": "NOODP", "og": {"title": "Coronavirus: Visa restrictions not for essential travel, India tells Japan | India News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coronavirus-visa-restrictions-not-for-essential-travel-india-tells-japan/articleshow/74554990.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74554999,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-329154,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "India News: After Japan's strong demarche, India has assured Japan that the visa restrictions won't come in the way of essential travels including business-relate.", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coronavirus-visa-restrictions-not-for-essential-travel-india-tells-japan/articleshow/74554990.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74554999,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-329154,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "Coronavirus: Visa restrictions not for essential travel, India tells Japan | India News - Times of India", "description": "India News: After Japan's strong demarche, India has assured Japan that the visa restrictions won't come in the way of essential travels including business-relate.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "news_keywords": "India, News, Google news, Breaking News, India news, Live News, Latest newsTokyo,South Korea,Osaka,japan,Italy,Iran", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coronavirus-visa-restrictions-not-for-essential-travel-india-tells-japan/articleshow/74554990.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 26781952138, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coronavirus-visa-restrictions-not-for-essential-travel-india-tells-japan/articleshow/74554990.cms"}
