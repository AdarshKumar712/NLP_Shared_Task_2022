Eat better? Drink more water? Get more sleep?\n\nDo you have any resolutions as far as your beauty routine is concerned?\n\nI, personally, don\u2019t take long to get ready. It takes me just a few minutes to put on my make-up. Letting my hair air dry takes the longest. I need to start getting ready a couple of hours before I need to leave if I want to let my hair dry naturally and have my natural wave come through. If I don\u2019t mind not having my natural waves, I can just blow dry my hair.\n\nMy daughter takes FOREVER to get ready. Not only is she very particular about her make-up (she has to have the \u201cperfect\u201d eye), but her hair\u2026 oh my goodness her hair\u2026 that takes the longest. First she needs to take a shower and wash her hair. Then she needs to blow dry her hair. She has very thick hair, so that alone takes a very long time. After her hair is dry, she then has to use the straightener to straighten her hair.\n\nIf only there was a way she could dry and straighten her hair at the same time, but that would not be possible. Or would it?\n\nBelieve it or not, you CAN blow dry your hair AND straighten it at the same time. All you need is a revolutionary product called RevAir.\n\nRevAir is the world\u2019s first and only reverse air dryer. By reverse air, I mean instead of blowing hot air on your hair, RevAir \u201csucks\u201d (for lack of a better description) the wetness from your hair. I liken it to a vaccuum cleaner\u2026 but for your hair.\n\nNot only does RevAir dry your hair 3x faster than conventional hair dryers, it also straightens your hair too.\n\nRevAir is good for all hair types, from fine to thick and from straight to kinky/curly. Anyone could use and enjoy RevAir.\n\nI was sent a unit to review.\n\nI was shocked when I received the package. The brand includes a lot with the unit (depending on the package you purchase). The one I received included a holder, clips and more goodies.\n\nThis is NOT your ordinary hair dryer. It literally looks like a mini-vacuum cleaner. The RevAir has a triangular shaped base, a thick hose and a strangely shaped wand at the end.\n\nThe wand creates a reverse-air tunnel that surrounds your hair from root to tip with heated air to naturally dry and straighten your hair. The high heat setting is half the wattage of a standard blow dryer. There is also a low heat setting and it can be used with no heat, as a cool shot of air. Reverse-air moves heat in the natural direction of cuticles helping to smooth hair. Consistent tension effectively straightens hair replacing the need for a brush\u2019s damaging friction.\n\nCheck out this brief video to see the RevAir in action.\n\nDue to a shoulder injury, I am unable to use the RevAir myself (using it was my initial \u201cgame plan\u201d when offered a unit to review). My daughter was more than happy to use the RevAir and help me to facilitate my review.\n\nMy daughter has very thick hair. It\u2019s normally wavy towards the ends of her hair (as seen in the photo below). It used to be thicker/wavier, but years of coloring and cutting it has taken away some of the thickness and wave to her hair.\n\nMy daughter\u2019s hair is still wet/damp in the above photo. The top layer of her hair has already started to dry. You can use RevAir with wet hair (it just took me a bit to take the \u201cbefore\u201d photo, which is why it started to dry).\n\nSmall sections of you hair goes inside of the RevAir wand to \u201csuck\u201d the water out of it, while straightening it at the same time. If you would like to learn more about the process, you can read about it here \u2013 https://myrevair.com/pages/how-it-works.\n\nHere is my daughter\u2019s hair after using RevAir (disregard her split ends \u2013 that is from content coloring her hair).\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how quickly my daughter can get herself ready by combining two steps (drying her hair and straightening it). We both like how her hair looks afterwards. Using the flat iron makes her hair look stiff and too flat/straight. Using the RevAir her hair is straight, but in a more natural looking way.\n\nHere are some tips to using RevAir;\n\nTension (Reverse Air Speed) This is the dial on the Base Unit. Tension replaces the need for a brush or hot flat irons. Start at setting 2-3. Once you see what your individual hair can tolerate, you can go up one level at a time. If you have any tangles, go down a level. Do not turn it immediately to level 7, as it may not give you the best result \u2013 in fact, it can be the opposite. Coily, Type 4 hair usually works best around Level 5-7. Heat This is located on the Wand. The Temperature Settings are No, Low and High Heat. Even the hottest heat of the Wand is LESS than the lowest heat on most Flat Irons. No Pumping There is no need to pump or bounce the want. In fact, when you do that, you are not allowing the roots to get dry. The reverse-air move constantly and consistently down the entire length of your hair, drying from root to end at once. Bouncing the wand may distrupt air flow and that can cause tangles. Time to Dry Each section will dry in 30-90 seconds, so long as Wand is kept to scalp. Thickness, texture and section size mean your time may vary. Experiment to find your ideal time. Test by pulling Wand a few inches away from scalp and touching roots. If they are dry, it is likely you are done.\n\nWaist length hair is much less dense at the ends, watch your tension setting and perhaps use detangler on the ends. You may need to use a bit bigger section if tangles occur at low tension settings (1 or 2). Some may have to dry in 2 phases \u2013 Dry the roots first, then move about half way down on a lower setting to be sure each section of hair gets dry time in the wand chamber. Want it straighter? For those with Type 4 hair, you may find you want to finish your look with flat ironing. Remember, getting hair to this point has just happened in less time with less heat, meaning less damage.\n\nIt took my daughter a few times to figure out what level works best for her. Now that she has the settings figured out to suit her hair type, it takes her even less time to do her hair. She\u2019s a \u201cpro\u201d at using RevAir now.\n\nOnce my shoulder is better, I am going to start using the RevAir too. I do like how my hair looks with it\u2019s natural wave, but those times where I want to change up my look, or I just need for my hair to dry faster (for example, when it\u2019s freezing cold outside), I will defiantly use the RevAir. I have seen how nice my daughter\u2019s hair looks using it, and I know what a time saver it is.\n\nThere are only a few \u201cissues\u201d some might have with RevAir. For one, it is costly (over $300+), so it is not \u201cbudget friendly.\u201d If you would like to take into considering how much time it saves you on your beauty routine, then the price makes it well worth it. I would never be able to afford one myself, but owning one, I can appreciate the benefit to owning one.\n\nThe unit is large, and the hose is cumbersome. You would need room in your closet to fit it. My daughter keeps in on the floor by her dresser because we have no other place to house it. It does take up a lot more room than a typical hair dryer.\n\nInitially it\u2019s a little awkward to use, but once you get the hang of it, it\u2019s not that bad (as per my daughter).\n\nMy daughter loves the RevAir, and she uses it all the time. She\u2019s also very picky about her beauty products, so that says a lot about the RevAir.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about RevAir, visit RevAir.com.
