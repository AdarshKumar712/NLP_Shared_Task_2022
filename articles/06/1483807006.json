This includes 2.02 trillion baht from international tourists and 1.16 trillion baht from domestic tourists.\n\nThe outlook for 2020 follows the overall tourism situation in 2019, which is estimated to generate 3.06 trillion baht (4 per cent increase over 2018), comprising 1.96 trillion baht (up 4 per cent) from 39.77 million international tourists (also up 4 per cent) and 1.10 trillion baht (up 3 per cent) from 167 million domestic trips (up 1 per cent). Thailand welcomed the 39 millionth tourist on December 27, 2019.\n\nIn 2020, TAT is seeing a positive outlook of international tourists to Thailand from several markets including the CLMV countries (Cambodia, Lao PDR., Myanmar, and Vietnam), Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Spain, Eastern Europe, Israel, and the US. The Chinese, Singaporean and Middle Eastern markets are showing signs of recovery. Meanwhile, the Japanese, Hong Kong, European, Scandinavian, Australian and Latin American markets are expected to remain stable or show slow growth.\n\nYuthasak Supasorn, TAT governor says, \u201cTAT\u2019s target for 2020 is based on several favourable factors, ranging from the government\u2019s stimulus measures, TAT\u2019s focused marketing strategies and promotions of emerging destinations, new air routes and the positive outlook of international tourists to Thailand from key source markets.\n\n\u201cTAT is also preparing to overcome several challenges, including the effect from the China-US trade war, the rise in consumption tax in Japan, and Brexit. The strong Thai baht, Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, World Expo 2020 Dubai and stimulus visa schemes from country competitors have also been taken into consideration when laying out our tourism marketing strategies.\u201d\n\ntourismthailand.org", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Thailand", "Serving Prime Minister flying long haul economy \u2013 strange or expected? 31 Dec 2019", "Eurostar extends cancellations into 2020 31 Dec 2019", "Turkish Airlines LYS \u2013 IST \u2013 KUL 31 Dec 2019"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) expects 2.02 trillion baht from international tourists and 1.16 trillion baht from domestic tourists\u2026", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.businesstraveller.com/wp-content/themes/bt2017/assets/favicon/apple-touch-icon-152x152.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) expects 2.02 trillion baht from international tourists and 1.16 trillion baht from domestic tourists\u2026", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.businesstraveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Bangkok.jpg", "width": 916, "height": 516, "alt": "Bangkok"}, "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Thailand expects 3.18 trillion baht tourism revenue in 2020 \u2013 Business Traveller", "description": "The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) expects 2.02 trillion baht from international tourists and 1.16 trillion baht from domestic tourists\u2026", "url": "https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/12/31/thailand-expects-3-18-trillion-baht-tourism-revenue-in-2020/", "site_name": "Business Traveller"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BusinessTraveller"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@BTUK", "title": "Thailand expects 3.18 trillion baht tourism revenue in 2020 \u2013 Business Traveller", "description": "The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) expects 2.02 trillion baht from international tourists and 1.16 trillion baht from domestic tourists\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.businesstraveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Bangkok.jpg", "width": 916, "height": 516, "alt": "Bangkok"}}, "generator": "GD bbPress Toolbox Pro 5.7.3, Build 815"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/12/31/thailand-expects-3-18-trillion-baht-tourism-revenue-in-2020/"}
