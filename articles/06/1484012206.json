The president campaigned to kick undocumented migrants out of the U.S. and is building a fence along the southern border.\n\nIn July, a group of 21 former Trump Organization workers who staffed his golf clubs and were facing deportation sought a meeting with the president, urging him in an open letter to \"do the right thing.\"\n\n\"We are modest people who represent the dreams of the 11 million undocumented men, women and children who live and work in this country,\" the group wrote. \"We love America and want to talk to you about helping to give us a chance to become legal.\"\n\nThey wrote that the Trump family and their associates know them and \"will recall how hard we worked for you, your family and your golf clubs.\"\n\n\"You know we are hard workers and that we are not criminals or seeking a free ride in America,\" the letter read. \"We believe you have a heart and will do the right thing to find a home for us here in America so that we can step out of the shadows and not deport us and our friends and family.\"\n\nThis article was updated with more information on the Albemarle Estate hotel.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Immigration", "Donald Trump", "Trump organization"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 10:12:06 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Trump-owned vineyard in Virginia reportedly only let go of its undocumented workers at the end of the harvest.
