MOR\u2019s John R. Horner Curator of Paleontology Dr. John Scannella will present at 6pm.\n\nDiscoveries made by paleontologists continue to shed new light on the deep past of the planet and the creatures that arose here. This series explores recent findings and current hypotheses as conveyed by scientists who are actively exploring how life on Earth has changed through time and what the fossils of extinct organisms can teach us about the world today.\n\nThe next Science Inquiry Lecture, \u201cThe Yellowstone Volcano: News from the Front,\u201d is set for Wednesday, January 15th. The presentation will begin at 7pm.\n\nWhat does front line research tell us about the current state of the immense volcano that makes up much of Yellowstone National Park? Dr. Michael Poland, Scientist-in-Charge of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, will discuss the geologic hazards of the Yellowstone region, activity that has been recorded in 2019, and recent research into how the Yellowstone volcanic system works.\n\nOn Thursday, January 16th, the Extreme History Project Lecture series continues with \u201cThe Sort Who Make Good Citizens: Empire, An African American Community in Wyoming, 1908\u20131920\u201d at 6pm. Further program information TBA.\n\nPlease note: All held in Hager Auditorium, public lectures have a limited capacity and are free of admission on a first come, first served basis.

Deadly snakes, colorful lizards, unusual turtles and rugged crocodilians are exhibited in naturalistic habitats. You can \u201cmilk\u201d a viper, learn to speak croc in under five minutes, and test your knowledge with \u201cTurtle Trivia\u201d or \u201cLizard Wizard.\u201d An experienced zoo professional remains with the exhibit to care for the living collection.
