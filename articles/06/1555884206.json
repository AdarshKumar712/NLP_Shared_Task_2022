The 28-year-old spent the last two seasons with the New York Jets.\n\nAt 6-foot-3, 263 pounds, Copeland is an outside linebacker who started 10 games in 2018 and set career highs in sacks (five), quarterback hits (13) and tackles for loss (eight). Last season, Copeland was suspended the first four games for violating the league\u2019s policy on performance-enhancing substances. He made three starts, and had a career-high 42 tackles and 1\u00bd sacks.\n\nAn undrafted free agent out of Penn, he played three seasons with the Lions before joining the Jets.\n\n\u2022 Robert Kraft won\u2019t soon forget what Tom Brady did for his franchise.\n\nAs such, the Patriots owner took out a full-page ad thanking the quarterback for in Sunday\u2019s Tampa Bay Times. The headline reads \u201cTHANK YOU TOM\u201d.\n\nThe message said:\n\nFor 20 amazing years you gave us everything you had. When you arrived as a sixth-round pick \u2013 and the best selection this franchise ever made \u2013 no one imagined how much you\u2019d soon mean to an entire region. You now leave New England after two decades of dominance as the GOAT and forever a part of our family.\n\nYour passion for the game, competitiveness and constant pursuit of excellence resulted in an unprecedented six Super Bowl victories, nine conference championships and 17 division titles. You\u2019re now recognized as the greatest of all time for what you\u2019ve accomplished on the field, but you\u2019re an even better person. Thank you, Tom for your countless contributions to the New England Patriots, and we wish you and your beautiful family continued success. There will never be another Tom Brady.\u201d\n\nTo the Buccaneers fans and Tampa Bay community \u2013 take care of him. You got a great one.\n\nWith much love and appreciation,\n\nThe Kraft family and the New England Patriots\n\nJETS: Two people with direct knowledge of the contract say cornerback Pierre Desir has agreed to terms on a deal.\n\nThe 29-year-old defensive back spent the past three seasons with Indianapolis, where he had 161 tackles, five interceptions, 26 passes defensed, two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery in 37 games, including 29 starts.\n\nThe Colts saved nearly $7 million on their salary cap for this season by releasing him on Saturday.\n\nSEAHAWKS: Seattle continue to stockpile offensive linemen in free agency, agreeing to terms with former first-rounder Chance Warmack, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.\n\nWarmack has not played since 2018, when he appeared in nine games for Philadelphia. He sat out last season to reportedly get healthy after a series of injuries.\n\nWarmack, 28, joins Seattle\u2019s growing list of offensive linemen either already under contract or acquired during the early days of free agency. The Seahawks now have 14 offensive linemen, including the additions of free agents Warmack, B.J. Finney, Cedric Ogbuehi and Brandon Shell.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\u00ab Previous\n\nNext \u00bb", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Police Logs"], "authors": ["Email Writer"], "publish_date": "Sun Mar 22 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "New England adds to its depth chart at quarterback by agreeing to a deal with one of Tom Brady's former backups \u2013 Brian Hoyer.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/06/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "description": "New England adds to its depth chart at quarterback by agreeing to a deal with one of Tom Brady's former backups \u2013 Brian Hoyer.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "NFL notebook: Hoyer returning to Patriots again", "description": "New England adds to its depth chart at quarterback by agreeing to a deal with one of Tom Brady's former backups \u2013 Brian Hoyer.", "url": "https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/03/22/nfl-notebook-hoyer-returning-to-patriots-again/", "site_name": "Kennebec Journal and Morning Sentinel", "updated_time": "2020-03-22T23:37:08-04:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/AP_19230259482495-1-1024x576.jpg", "secure_url": "https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/AP_19230259482495-1-1024x576.jpg", "width": 1600, "height": 900}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mainenewspaper", "section": "Sports", "published_time": "2020-03-22T20:46:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-22T23:37:08-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "New England adds to its depth chart at quarterback by agreeing to a deal with one of Tom Brady's former backups \u2013 Brian Hoyer.", "title": "NFL notebook: Hoyer returning to Patriots again - CentralMaine.com", "image": "https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/AP_19230259482495-1.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.pressherald.com/2020/03/22/nfl-notebook-hoyer-returning-to-patriots-again/"}
