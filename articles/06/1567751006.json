He was the finance minister for the state of Hesse, where Germany's financial center Frankfurt lies.\n\nThe body of a man identified as Thomas Sch\u00e4fer, the finance minister of the German state of Hesse, was found on a high-speed train line in the town of Hochheim between Frankfurt and Mainz, police confirmed Saturday.\n\nThe presence of a body on the tracks was first reported by witnesses to paramedics, who were unable to initially identify the remains due to the extent of the injuries.\n\nInvestigators said an investigation on the scene confirmed the identity of the man as Sch\u00e4fer and that the death was likely a suicide. Police did not immediately release further details of the case.\n\nThe politician apparently left a note before taking his own life, German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported, citing sources close to the investigation. The note, according to the report, referenced Sch\u00e4fer's reasons for his apparent suicide.\n\nAccording to media in the state of Hesse, the 54-year-old regularly appeared in public in recent days, for example, to inform the public about financial assistance during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nSch\u00e4fer had \"considerable worries\" over COVID-19\n\nSch\u00e4fer was a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats (CDU). He had been active in Hessian state politics for more than two decades and was finance minister for almost 10 years.\n\nGermany's financial capital, Frankfurt, lies in Hesse and is the state's biggest city.\n\nSch\u00e4fer had been widely expected to succeed state premier, Volker Bouffier, if he decided not to stand for re-election in 2023.\n\nIn a statement, Bouffier said that the state's leadership has received the news with \"sadness and disbelief.\"\n\nBouffier also said that Sch\u00e4fer had been living under considerable worry and stress because of the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"His main concern was whether he could manage to fulfill the huge expectations of the population, especially in terms of financial aid,\" Bouffier said on Sunday. \"He clearly couldn't see any way out. He was desperate, and so he left us. That has shocked us, has shocked me.\"\n\n\"Our sincere condolences go to his closest relatives,\" he added.\n\nOutgoing CDU chief Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said Sch\u00e4fer's sudden death \"shocked me, shocked all of us\" in the party. \"It has hit us and left us sad and stunned,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nOne of the candidates to succeed Kramp-Karrenbauer as leader of the party, Friedrich Merz, and possible successor to Merkel as chancellor wrote on Twitter about his shock at the death.\n\n\"News about the sudden death of Thomas Sch\u00e4fer has deeply shaken me,\" Merz wrote on Twitter. \"As a person and politician he was one of our best \u2013 this is a difficult loss. We will mourn him with his wife and children.\"\n\nLawmakers from other parties also paid tribute to Sch\u00e4fer.\n\nLeft party member of the Bundestag Fabio De Masi wrote on Twitter \"We often no longer recognize politicians as people or the burdens they carry away from politics.\"\n\nGreen politician Kordula Schulz-Asch wrote \"I am stunned by the death of Thomas Sch\u00e4fer. My deepest condolences and thoughts to his family at this time.\"\n\nSch\u00e4fer leaves behind a wife and two children.\n\nIf you are suffering from serious emotional strain or suicidal thoughts, do not hesitate to seek professional help.
