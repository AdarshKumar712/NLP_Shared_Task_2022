Still, it\u2019s a good moment to take stock.\n\nFor the West, this decade marked the end of the post-Cold War triumph of liberalism \u2014 the belief in economic and individual freedom balanced by welfare programs and regulation at home, and support for a \u201cliberal world order\u201d abroad. In a way, the stage for the end of liberalism was set in the late 2000s by the financial crisis and the failure of nation-building in Iraq. But the full consequences became evident several years later.\n\nBy the end of the 2010s, much of the West was consumed by right-wing populist fever \u2014 with the ostensible leader of the free world as populist-in-chief \u2014 with a radical socialist revival underway on the left.\n\nThis decade also saw an unprecedented rise of identity politics, in the United States and in many other Western countries. The intense focus on racism that began with the fatal shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 addressed some real issues. But it also turned into a zealotry that often ignored facts, assigned collective guilt, and inflated trivial offenses. Talk of \u201cwhiteness\u201d and \u201cwhite privilege\u201d became mainstreamed.\n\nGender politics followed the same trajectory, from valid concerns to polarizing rhetoric of \u201crape culture\u201d and \u201ctoxic masculinity.\u201d\n\nMoreover, thanks to the social media explosion and the spread of technology that made it easy to capture and share videos, progressive identity politics became wedded to \u201cattack now, check later\u201d public shaming of perceived bigots.\n\nThe emergence of white \u2014 and white male \u2014 identity politics toward the decade\u2019s end, culminating in the election of Donald Trump, was certainly not just a backlash against the excesses of progressivism. However, when racial and gender labeling is normalized and the stigma of racism is diluted by trivial accusations, this ultimately plays into the hands of the far right.\n\nIt is not an accident that as the decade of tribalism comes to an end, we see the comeback of violent anti-Semitism, now even in America, perpetrated by extremists of all stripes.\n\nSign up for The Point Go inside New York politics.

Optimists point to the good things that are being overlooked, including progress in medicine and in fighting poverty. But without a return of true liberalism, no gains are secure.\n\nCathy Young is a contributing editor to Reason magazine.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cathy Young"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 06:00:18 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A decade is an arbitrary 10-year span, especially since people can\u2019t even agree on when this decade ends: with the arrival of 2020 or 2021?
