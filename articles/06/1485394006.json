But Mr Kurz and Mr Kogler are poles apart on key issues, and the talks to forge a coalition deal were long and tough.\n\nThe agreement comes more than three months after the elections. Mr Kogler seized on the agreement as an opportunity to provide a \u201crole model for Europe\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe new conservatives and the Greens are on the advance in Europe and if that's the challenge of coming together here, it's worth the risk,\u201d he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Justin Huggler"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 17:19:16 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Austria\u2019s conservative and Green parties announced a new coalition government deal on Thursday that includes a ban on headscarves in schools and a pledge to make the country carbon neutral by 2040.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@yahooNewsUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Austria\u2019s conservative and Green parties announced a new coalition government deal on Thursday that includes a ban on headscarves in schools and a pledge to make the country carbon neutral by 2040.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LxNWQs49a3mz7_BaMymyFQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/14755228715196a71759c130ed1c4be7", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LxNWQs49a3mz7_BaMymyFQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/14755228715196a71759c130ed1c4be7"}, "title": "New coalition to crack down on headscarves and make Austria carbon neutral by 2040"}, "summary": "Latest News, World & UK News Headlines", "robots": "noindex", "news_keywords": "Sebastian Kurz, Werner Kogler, Austria, coalition government", "googlebot": "noindex", "bingbot": "noindex", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=b208a5fa-0c48-3766-8d0b-a61d0127994d&src=web", "description": "Austria\u2019s conservative and Green parties announced a new coalition government deal on Thursday that includes a ban on headscarves in schools and a pledge to make the country carbon neutral by 2040.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LxNWQs49a3mz7_BaMymyFQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/14755228715196a71759c130ed1c4be7", "description": "Austria\u2019s conservative and Green parties announced a new coalition government deal on Thursday that includes a ban on headscarves in schools and a pledge to make the country carbon neutral by 2040.", "title": "New coalition to crack down on headscarves and make Austria carbon neutral by 2040", "url": "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/coalition-crack-down-headscarves-austria-171916319.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 115060728528067}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=b208a5fa-0c48-3766-8d0b-a61d0127994d&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=b208a5fa-0c48-3766-8d0b-a61d0127994d&src=web"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/coalition-crack-down-headscarves-austria-171916319.html"}
