The group was uncovered when two of its principal members, Uwe Mundlos and Uwe B\u00f6hnhardt, were found dead in a mobile home after a botched bank robbery attracted police attention. They are believed to have committed suicide after setting the vehicle ablaze, although the precise circumstances of their death are still under investigation. A search of the property they tried to torch helped unravel the NSU's past, with a pistol belonging to the dead policewoman the most crucial early find. The alleged main co-conspirator to Mundlos and B\u00f6hnhardt, Beate Zsch\u00e4pe, is currently facing trial.
