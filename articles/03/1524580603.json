(Tom Brenner/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump agreed Tuesday with Attorney General William Barr\u2019s claim that his incessant tweeting, particularly as it relates to ongoing DOJ cases, makes the job of the attorney general more difficult.\n\n\u201cI do make his job harder. I do agree with that. I think that\u2019s true,\u201d Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEverybody has the right to speak their mind. I use social media. I guess I use it well because here I am,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI probably would not have gotten here without social media, because I certainly don\u2019t get fair press.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general expressed frustration last week after Trump complained on Twitter that the prosecutors\u2019 seven-to-nine-year sentencing recommendation for his longtime adviser Roger Stone was a \u201chorrible and very unfair situation.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, the Justice Department submitted a revised filing stating that the prosecutors\u2019 recommended lengthy sentence \u201ccould be considered excessive and unwarranted,\u201d sparking allegations that Trump was influencing Barr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,\u201d Barr said, but added that he is not being \u201cbullied or influenced\u201d by anyone regarding any DOJ cases.\n\nStone was convicted of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing the House\u2019s investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s connections to Russia. All four of the prosecutors who recommended Stone\u2019s seven-to-nine-year sentence either resigned or quit the case after the DOJ weighed in.\n\nDespite Barr\u2019s criticism of the president\u2019s public remarks, Trump insisted Tuesday that he still has \u201ctotal confidence\u201d in Barr, whom he added has \u201cincredible integrity.\u201d\n\nTrump added that he \u201cnever spoke\u201d to Barr about the Stone case.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very straight shooter. We have a great attorney general, and he is working very hard,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s working against a lot of people that don\u2019t want to see good things happen, in my opinion. That\u2019s my opinion, not his opinion. You will have to ask what his opinion is.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSocial media for me has been very important,\u201d the president added. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to have a voice.\u201d\n\nSend a tip to the news team at NR.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Jack Dunphy", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Jason Richwine", "Rich Lowry", "Jim Geraghty", "Jerry Bowyer", "Charles Bowyer", "David Harsanyi", "Kyle Smith"], "publish_date": "Tue Feb 18 20:19:28 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "President Trump agreed Tuesday with Attorney General William Barr's claim that his incessant tweeting makes the job more difficult.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/themes/national-review/static/images/favicons/apple-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/themes/national-review/static/images/favicons/favicon-96x96.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "google-site-verification": "0p9SDHXWowdbrg4wkf-aR1ejmq4mTT8io_fKCQrRjg0", "description": "President Trump agreed Tuesday with Attorney General William Barr's claim that his incessant tweeting makes the job more difficult.", "generator": "WordPress 5.4.1", "p": {"domain_verify": "d01ad36f4033677a2e4883eee1a13af1"}, "fb": {"pages": 15779440092}, "sailthru.date": "2020-02-18 15:19:28", "sailthru.title": "Trump Acknowledges Barr\u2019s Complaint about His Tweets: \u2018I Do Make His Job Harder\u2019", "sailthru.tags": "Donald Trump, Twitter, William Barr", "sailthru.description": "President Trump agreed Tuesday with Attorney General William Barr's claim that his incessant tweeting makes the job more difficult.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Trump-feb-14-.jpg?fit=2057%2C1201&ssl=1", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Trump-feb-14-.jpg?fit=50%2C29&ssl=1", "sailthru.author": "Mairead McArdle", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Trump Acknowledges Barr\u2019s Complaint about His Tweets: \u2018I Do Make His Job Harder\u2019 | National Review", "url": "https://www.nationalreview.com/news/trump-acknowledges-barrs-complaint-about-his-tweets-i-do-make-his-job-harder/", "description": "President Trump agreed Tuesday with Attorney General William Barr\u2019s claim that his incessant tweeting makes the job more difficult.", "site_name": "National Review", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Trump-feb-14-.jpg?fit=1200%2C701&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 701}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-18T20:19:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-18T20:19:28+00:00", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Trump Acknowledges Barr\u2019s Complaint about His Tweets: \u2018I Do Make His Job Harder\u2019"}, "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Trump-feb-14-.jpg?fit=1200%2C701&ssl=1&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.nationalreview.com/news/trump-acknowledges-barrs-complaint-about-his-tweets-i-do-make-his-job-harder/"}
