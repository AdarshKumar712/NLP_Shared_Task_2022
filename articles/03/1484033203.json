with Rachel Clarke, Belinda Buckley, jasmine Blacka, Sarah Berg, Emma Munro, Tori Langton, Riley Dod.\n\nFOR IPSWICH personal trainer Kristy-Bree Goodwin, it\u2019s not about the numbers on the scale or counting calories.\n\nHer approach with her clients at Lifestyle Health Club at Raceview is to exercise to feel healthy both physically and mentally.\n\nShe\u2019s hoping that\u2019s what people will focus on for their New Year\u2019s resolutions in 2020.\n\n\u201cI need everyone to know that as a trainer and someone in the industry, I struggle too,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI get why you struggle and I don\u2019t want people to have to struggle in this industry anymore.\n\n\u201cI want people in larger bodies to be able to exercise and it have nothing to do with weight loss.\n\n\u201cI want people to know that they can come to me and I\u2019m never going to make them weigh themselves, I\u2019m never going to tell them how to eat if the way they eat makes them happy.\u201d\n\nMs Goodwin has been in the fitness industry for more than six years and has re-evaluated what she says is most important.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I was always in a bigger body, I didn\u2019t really like exercise, I loathed it really.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until 2011 when one of my girlfriends introduced me to a group fitness class that I started exercising and enjoying it.\n\n\u201cThere was no tie to weight, body, shape or losing weight, it was more like a fun social thing.\u201d\n\nIt was when she started to delve deep into the industry that she start to lose sight of what made her happy.\n\n\u201cIt was all about the way you looked and aesthetics, rather than health and fitness,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was partaking in all these distorted behaviours to get to an acceptable size or a physique that society and the fitness industry deems acceptable.\n\n\u201cI was so unhappy, because of how I got there.\u201d\n\nShe has since developed new, happy and healthy habits and is dedicated to helping others do the same with a focus on how it feels, not how it looks.\n\n\u201cMy approach to exercise is you do what makes you feel good,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere are so many benefits from exercise that have absolutely nothing to do with changing your physique, like building muscle and running faster, being fitter, and cardiovascular health.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["fitness-industry", "health", "healthy-food", "healthy-living", "new-years-resolutions", "redefining-health"], "tags": ["fitness industry", "healthy
