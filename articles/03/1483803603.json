It will be a year of ups and downs. It's what you can call a 'palm-up, palm-down'. A palm-up is for receiving while palm-down is for losing,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe cleric cautioned the youths to stay away from all forms of sexual perversion as God would be sanctioning all perpetrators of this unwholesome acts.\n\n\n\nOlukoya tagged 2020 as a year of spiritual revival and new glory. http://community.vanguardngr.com/forum/topics/breaking-mfm-s-pastor-olukoya-unveils-33-prophetic-declarations 19 Likes 6 Shares\n\nGlory to God 13 Likes 2 Shares\n\nWon tun ti de oo 74 Likes 2 Shares\n\nWhere is it? 3 Likes\n\nLol... on behalf of myself and every forward thinking Nigerians, please stick your prophesy up your arse!!\n\n\n\nThank you and God bless! 116 Likes 6 Shares\n\nTo God be the honour forever and ever amen 8 Likes 5 Shares\n\nWow!! 2 Likes\n\nMore to come...we no go hear word with prophecy this January 22 Likes 2 Shares\n\nHow long will they continue to list their prophesies here with no divine manifestation in the lives of average Nigerians?\n\n\n\nHow many pastors dey predict for China, Australia, Canada, United state??\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 365 days another prophesy will be out, outcome still the same\n\n\n\nSomething must be wrong with us 63 Likes 4 Shares\n\nAmen 1 Like\n\nOya naa 2 Likes\n\nMaking guesses, predicting or foretelling?
