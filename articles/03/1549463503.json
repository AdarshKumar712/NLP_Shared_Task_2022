The Swedish furniture store will open its second branch in the capital and only one inside the city. The expected date for its launch is July 2020. The existing showroom outlet in Abu Dhabi is on Yas Island.\n\nThe store will be on the first level of the mall and span 2,136 square metres. It will feature a showroom along with a sit-down dining area. But its proximity to the centre of Abu Dhabi is perhaps the most exciting part.\n\n\u201cOne of our key strategic objectives at Ikea is to reach and engage with many more of the many people, and with the opening of our second store in Abu Dhabi we edge closer to achieving our goal. We are delighted to open a new Ikea store at Al Wahda Mall, given the mall\u2019s strategic and central location, we will be in the city centre closer to where the many people live,\u201d said Vinod Jayan, the managing director of Al-Futtaim Ikea.\n\nBack in December, Ikea opened its fourth outlet at Festival Plaza mall and revealed it had 90,000 people apply for 200 jobs at the store. Prior to that opening, Mr Jayan also revealed plans for a Sharjah store, which is expected to be announced sometime in 2020, and an Oman Ikea set to open in 2021.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "It will be the second outlet in the capital and only one inside the city", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/polopoly_fs/7.107!/file/logo-32.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "creator": "Atex \u2013 http://www.atex.com", "application-name": "The National", "description": "It will be the second outlet in the capital and only one inside the city", "news_keywords": "Evelyn Lau,Lifestyle,Lifestyle,Home,", "parsely-post-id": "1.991194", "google-site-verification": "zupZPvcJ4TjE2PUIBOr4ND8eWiJR95ArU4eLYC0FpCw", "og": {"title": "Ikea is coming to Abu Dhabi's Al Wahda Mall", "site_name": "The National", "url": "https://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/home/ikea-is-coming-to-abu-dhabi-s-al-wahda-mall-1.991194", "description": "It will be the second outlet in the capital and only one inside the city", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.thenational.ae/polopoly_fs/7.107!/file/logo_big.png"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The National", "msapplication-TileImage": "/polopoly_fs/7.107!/file/logo-144.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#0095da", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1281497691, app-argument=https://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/home/ikea-is-coming-to-abu-dhabi-s-al-wahda-mall-1.991194", "pocket-site-verification": "e213738e8509de340a044fefa896b8", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheNationalUAE", "title": "Ikea is coming to Abu Dhabi's Al Wahda Mall", "image": "https://www.thenational.ae/image/policy:1.991193:1583924525/image.jpg?f=16x9&q=0.6&w=1200&$p$f$q$w=70c86c9"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/home/ikea-is-coming-to-abu-dhabi-s-al-wahda-mall-1.991194"}
