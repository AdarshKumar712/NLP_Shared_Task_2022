His cousin is 29.\n\nWhen they get back they carry on drinking and sometimes smoke weed.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to my husband several times but this carries on just the same.\n\nI could talk to his cousin\u2019s mum but she\u2019s not well and I don\u2019t want to give her the stress.\n\nGet in touch with Deidre today Got a problem?
