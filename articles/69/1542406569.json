Earth has experienced climate change in the past without help from humanity. We know about past climates because of evidence left in tree rings, layers of ice in glaciers, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. For example, bubbles of air in glacial ice trap tiny samples of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, giving scientists a history of greenhouse gases that stretches back more than 800,000 years. The chemical make-up of the ice provides clues to the average global temperature. See the Earth Observatory\u2019s series Paleoclimatology for details about how scientists study past climates.\n\nUsing this ancient evidence, scientists have built a record of Earth\u2019s past climates, or \u201cpaleoclimates.\u201d The paleoclimate record combined with global models shows past ice ages as well as periods even warmer than today. But the paleoclimate record also reveals that the current climatic warming is occurring much more rapidly than past warming events. As the Earth moved out of ice ages over the past million years, the global temperature rose a total of 4 to 7 degrees Celsius over about 5,000 years. In the past century alone, the temperature has climbed 0.7 degrees Celsius, roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Riebeek"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Global warming is happening now, and scientists are confident that greenhouse gases are responsible.
