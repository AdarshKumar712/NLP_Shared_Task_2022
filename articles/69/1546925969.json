(Picture: Rexburg Police Department/National Center for Missing and Exploited Children )\n\nA mother who spent \u2018all her time\u2019 with a doomsday cult before her son and daughter vanished is now refusing to help police find them.\n\nAuthorities have been searching for 46-year-old Lori Vallow\u2019s children, Joshua Vallow, 7, and Taylee Ryan, 17, since November after police in Rexburg, Idaho attempted to conduct a welfare check on Joshua, who is adopted and has autism.\n\nVallow\u2019s relatives called police when they had not heard from Joshua and became concerned. They also said Lori, who was once a \u2018wonderful, loving, attentive mother,\u2019 changed after she became involved with \u2018Preparing a People,\u2019 a group whose mission is to help prepare Earth for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, which Vallow\u2019s family called a \u2018cult.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, Idaho police said they \u2018strongly believe\u2019 the missing siblings are in danger. They also blasted Vallow for leaving the state with her new husband, Latter-day Saint and doomsday author Chad Daybell, instead of cooperating with the investigation.\n\n\u2018We publicly call on Lori Vallow/Daybell and Chad Daybell to do the right thing and come forward with the information they have about the location and welfare of Joshua and Tylee. This entire investigation could have been avoided if Lori and Chad had simply been honest with law enforcement,\u2019 Rexburg police said on Monday.\n\nLori Vallow reportedly fled the state with her new husband, Chad Daybell. (Picture: Freemont County Sheriff\u2019s Office)\n\n\u2018It is astonishing that rather than work with law enforcement to help us locate her own children, Lori Vallow has chosen instead to leave the state with her new husband,\u2019 the statement continued.\n\nUntil 2018, Vallow had been married to Charles Vallow, who she \u2018deserted\u2019 for more than two months this year after she became involved with the alleged cult, Charles\u2019 sister, Kay Vallow Woodcock said.\n\n'Carjacker kidnapped man and goat outside porn store and held them hostage for 130 miles'\n\n\u2018Charles did his best to save the marriage, of which she had no interest,\u2019 Woodcock said.\n\nOn July 11, Charles went to Lori\u2019s home to pick up Joshua and take him to school \u2013 but Lori\u2019s brother, Alexander Cox, shot and killed Charles during a domestic disturbance that remains under investigation. Cox claimed he acted in self defense and was never charged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree months after Charles Vallow was killed, Daybell\u2019s wife, Tammy, died at the age of 49. Daybell refused to order an autopsy and the coroner listed the cause of death as \u2018natural,\u2019 but investigators have since exhumed her body for testing, NBC reported.\n\nLori Vallow is pictured with her now-deceased husband Charles Vallow. (Picture: Facebook)\n\nChad Daybell pictured with his wife Tammy, who died in October 2019. (Picture Facebook)\n\nThen, on December 12, Cox died of unknown causes, leaving no other witnesses to Charles Vallow\u2019s death other than the Joshua and Taylee- who were last seen in September.\n\nDaybell and Vallow got married weeks after Tammy Daybell died. According to police, the new couple has repeatedly lied to witnesses and investigators about the missing children, telling a family friend that Joshua was in Arizona with a family friend.\n\nHunter found himself trapped in small metal hut with huge venomous snake\n\nThe couple also lied to witnesses that Taylee had died a year before her father died, police said. Chad also reportedly told a witness that Lori had no children.\n\nPolice said: \u2018We know that the children are not with Lori and Chad Daybell and we also have information indicating that Lori knows either the location of the children or what has happened to them. Despite having this knowledge, she has refused to work with law enforcement to help us resolve this matter.\u2019\n\nLast week, a lawyer hired by Daybell and Vallow insisted the couple did nothing wrong.\n\nAttorney Sean Bartholick said: \u2018Chad Daybell was a loving husband and has the support of his children in this matter. Lori (Vallow) Daybell is a devoted mother and resents assertions to the contrary. We look forward to addressing the allegations once they have moved beyond speculation and rumor.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn early December, police said they believed Joshua and Taylee\u2019s deaths are connected to the investigation into Daybell\u2019s first wife\u2019s death, which occurred approximately a month before the children were last seen.\n\nWoodcock wrote on Facebook: \u2018Help us shed light on this. Someone out there knows something but doesn\u2019t know how all the pieces fit together. Help me connect them with the police so we can bring justice to my brother and the other victims.\u2019", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["US news"], "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Instead of helping with the investigation, Lori Vallow left the Idaho with her new doomsday author husband, Chad Daybell.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/m-icon-black.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "google-site-verification": "NRfCb8mBNAy5_f17NpvLZYoY38EzM2dgpcOh_Am9yps", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/comp-1577887593.png?crop=0px%2C23px%2C1200px%2C631px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "title": "Doomsday cult mother is refusing to help police find her missing children", "description": "Instead of helping with the investigation, Lori Vallow left the state with her new doomsday author husband.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@MetroUK", "account_id": 138749160}, "description": "Instead of helping with the investigation, Lori Vallow left the Idaho with her new doomsday author husband, Chad Daybell.", "msvalidate.01": "11110DC8D42E74E13F24B3A18E7CFB8A", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "fb": {"pages": "117118184990145,427889824264313", "app_id": 176908729004638}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://metro.co.uk/2020/01/01/doomsday-cult-mother-is-refusing-to-help-police-find-her-missing-children-11987005/?ia_markup=1"}, "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Metro", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-01 15:07:54", "sailthru.title": "Doomsday cult mother is refusing to help police find her missing children", "sailthru.tags": "us news", "sailthru.description": "Instead of helping with the investigation, Lori Vallow left the state with her new doomsday author husband.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/comp-1577887593.png?crop=61px%2C0px%2C675px%2C675px&resize=150%2C150", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/comp-1577887593.png?crop=61px%2C0px%2C675px%2C675px&resize=150%2C150&w=50", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "title": "Doomsday cult mother is refusing to help police find her missing children", "type": "article", "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2020/01/01/doomsday-cult-mother-is-refusing-to-help-police-find-her-missing-children-11987005/", "description": "Instead of helping with the investigation, Lori Vallow left the state with her new doomsday author husband.", "site_name": "Metro", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/comp-1577887593_1577893280.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/comp-1577887593_1577893280.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MetroUK", "section": "News", "tag": "US news", "published_time": "2020-01-01T15:07:54+0000", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T15:41:16+0000"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/m-icon-black.png?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "https://metro.co.uk/2020/01/01/doomsday-cult-mother-is-refusing-to-help-police-find-her-missing-children-11987005/"}
