Here\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\nWindows 10 updates continue to cause problems STEVE KOTECKI\n\nMORE FROM FORBES How To Upgrade To Windows 10 For 'Free' In 2020 [Updated]\n\nPicked up by both BleepingComputer and Windows Latest, the early problems with Microsoft\u2019s new KB4535996 Windows 10 update are now spiraling out of control. Here are the main issues you need to be aware of.\n\n03/09 Update: Microsoft has confirmed Windows 10 has run into more trouble. The company has published a support page explaining that a new bug in Windows 10 can prevent users from manually installing drivers on their PCs. Users will receive the error message: \"A driver can't load on this device\" and it can break installations even after they appear to complete successfully. Microsoft states \"If you choose to continue using your device without addressing the driver problem, you might discover that the functionality the driver supports does not work any longer, which could have consequences ranging from negligible to severe.\" Third party drivers can be essential, particularly for legacy devices, so Microsoft has offered a workaround which (perhaps surprisingly) involves turning off a Windows 10 security setting that guards memory integrity to allow the driver installation to complete:\n\nGo to the Core isolation page in Windows Security. Turn the Memory integrity setting Off if it isn\u2019t already. You'll need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.\n\nMicrosoft offers no timeline for a proper fix to this issue but, given the level of inconvenience and potential problems, surely it will be a priority.\n\n03/10 Update: the problems associated with KB4535996 are still increasing. The always diligent BetaNews, reports that some Windows 10 users who have installed the update are discovering that sleep no longer works correctly on their computers and Microsoft's KB4535996 community page is filled complaints including broken search, trouble opening apps and a growing number of users reporting their PCs will not boot after updating. Remarkably, three days on from these troubles beginning, Microsoft still states on its KB4535996 update page that it is \"not currently aware of any issues with this update\". Ignore this. If you haven't already, get the Windows Update troubleshooter and proactively block KB4535996. Until more is known, this is an update you need to avoid.\n\nBoot Problems And Crashes\n\nThe former appears to be widespread among users who have installed KB4535996, with significant delays in PCs starting after installing the update and occasionally showing a disconcerting black screen partway through the elongated boot process. My own PC is exhibiting this problem.\n\nThat said, if you have this issue you are lucky because for others their PCs will not boot at all:\n\n\u201cI just had this update on my PC and now it will not boot. Fails the BIOS POST test with a series of beeps, completely blank screen. I bought it only 5 days ago, have tried re-seating the RAM and GPU. Hard to decipher the beeps as the screen is blank and I don\u2019t know what MB make it is. (8 regular slow beeps. Then a repeat of two slow low tone beeps, two fast high tone beeps - if that means anything to anyone!) I did have some important work to do, but I guess not, thanks Microsoft :( I presume there is no way to fix this and the PC is now dead, as it won\u2019t ever boot up again now, to receive a Windows update fix ... to fix this \u2018update fix\u2019?\u201d - source\n\nBlue Screen Of Death\n\nThe infamous BSOD is also hitting users with KB4535996 installed with the blue screen appearing as Windows loads the login screen. This appears to be less widespread, but when it does hit it can hit hard. Bleeping Computer highlights the plight of one company in particular:\n\n\u201cSeeing this issue with about 200 machines. Uninstalling the update doesn\u2019t come off cleanly and still gets lock ups on initial boot.\u201d\n\nSlowdowns\n\nWindows 10 stutters, dropped frame rates (primarily in games), high disk usage and thrashing have also all been reported.\n\n\u201cIt's not extreme, but I say my framerate in games has gone down 10 frames or so and stuttering occurs once in a while,\u201d wrote one user on Reddit. \u201cAfter uninstalling the cumulative update, everything was fine. Weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan confirm. Ramped up my CPU usage and caused stuttering even on the easiest games to run,\u201d - source\n\n\u201cAfter I installed the update the disk usage in task manager is 100% all the time, and my pc is slow af now!\u201d - source\n\nAudio Problems\n\nInstalling KB4535996 has resulted in reports of broken audio in Windows 10 too:\n\n\u201cThanks to the recent update I no longer have any sound on my computer, I\u2019ve tried everything and nothing will fix it besides rolling the update back, point is [I] shouldn't have to. Microsoft needs to get their **** together.\u201d - source\n\n\u201cThe latest Microsoft update has caused my audio to stop working.\u201d - source\n\n\u201cI updated on the 1st March I have nothing but troubles now intermittent shutting down sound issues video issues I cannot uninstall this even after a reset\u201d - source\n\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Impacted\n\nThe Visual Studio code-signing tool signtool.exe appears widely broken for many users. Coder Rafael Rivera appears to have found the root of it warning: \u201cIf you're having trouble with signtool.exe, check if you have KB4535996 (optional 2020-02 CU) installed. Looks like WTLogConfigCiScriptEvent got removed from wldp.dll without sufficient testing.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft has also issued a warning about this stating: \u201cWe\u2019re aware of issues with signtool.exe after installing the latest optional update for Windows 10, version 1903 or Windows 10, version 1909 (KB4535996). If you are encountering issues or receiving errors related to signtool.exe, you can uninstall the optional update KB4535996. We are working on a resolution and estimate a solution will be available in mid-March.\"\n\nAnd yet here\u2019s the crazy part: go to the KB4535996 page and Microsoft still writes \u201cMicrosoft is not currently aware of any issues with this update\u201d. The company regularly fails to update the warnings on troubled Windows 10 updates (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) but this time it\u2019s particularly poor.\n\nWhile some users have experienced problems trying to uninstall KB4535996, these are the steps you need to follow:\n\nIn Windows Desktop Search type \u2018update history\u2019 then click \u2018View your Update history\u2019\n\nSelect \u2018Uninstall Updates\u2019\n\nOn the Installed Updates dialog window, find and select KB4535996, click the Uninstall button\n\nRestart\n\nYou can also download Windows Update troubleshooter, which will enable you to block KB4535996 proactively / stop it from reinstalling.\n\nAll these problems come just weeks after a Windows 10 update started deleting user data while another was pulled days earlier for causing system crashes. Microsoft has recently rolled out Windows 10 optional update improvements first announced in September but the quality of updates themselves still leave a lot to be desired.\n\nMicrosoft, it's time to do better.\n\n___\n\nFollow Gordon on Facebook\n\nMore On Forbes\n\nHow To Upgrade To Windows 10 For \u2018Free\u2019 In 2020\n\nWindows 10 Alert: This Is The Default Setting You Must Change To Stay Safe\n\nNew Windows 10 Update Is Deleting Data For Some Users", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Microsoft", "Windows 10", "Windows", "Windows 10 update", "Windows 10 problem", "Windows 10 crash", "Windows 10 upgrade", "Microsoft Windows 10"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Gordon Kelly", "Senior Contributor"], "publish_date": "Sat Mar  7 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Microsoft has issued a Windows 10 update warning as reports of serious problems are escalating quickly...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i.forbesimg.com/48X48-F.png", "meta_data": {"referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=5,minimum-scale=1,user-scalable=yes", "description": "Microsoft has issued a Windows 10 update warning as reports of serious problems are escalating quickly...", "keywords": "Microsoft,Windows 10,Windows,Windows 10 update,Windows 10 problem,Windows 10 crash,Windows 10 upgrade,Microsoft Windows 10", "news_keywords": "Microsoft,Windows 10,Windows,Windows 10 update,Windows 10 problem,Windows 10 crash,Windows 10 upgrade,Microsoft Windows 10", "author": "Gordon Kelly", "article": {"channel": "Innovation", "section": "Consumer Tech", "section_url": "https://www.forbes.com/consumer-tech/", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/2907-5e643dafbc8858000648a5c7", "published": "2020-03-10", "modified": "2020-03-28", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes", "author": "Gordon Kelly"}, "og": {"title": "New Windows 10 Update Causing Boot Problems, Slowdowns And BSOD Crashes", "site_name": "Forbes", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2020/03/07/microsoft-windows-10-warning-crashes-boot-audio-slowdown-problems-upgrade-windows-10-free/", "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/5d99327b67dd830006a2c7bd/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200&fit=bounds", "description": "Microsoft has issued a Windows 10 update warning as reports of serious problems are escalating quickly...", "updated_time": "2020-03-28T10:23:14.442-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@forbes", "title": "New Windows 10 Update Causing Boot Problems, Slowdowns And BSOD Crashes", "description": "Microsoft has issued a Windows 10 update warning as reports of serious problems are escalating quickly...", "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/5d99327b67dd830006a2c7bd/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200&fit=bounds"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2020/03/07/microsoft-windows-10-warning-crashes-boot-audio-slowdown-problems-upgrade-windows-10-free/"}
