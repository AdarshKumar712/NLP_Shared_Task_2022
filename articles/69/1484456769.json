And by bang, we mean more ads on your phone. Yikes.\n\nIt\u2019s called \u201ccontent recommendations\u201d and Realme says it\u2019s being done to give users a better ecosystem and to keep a sustainable business model, but it\u2019s definitely something to keep an eye out for with your next phone.\n\nThe process is pretty simple, at least if you\u2019re familiar with other Android device bloatware. You\u2019ll randomly see promotions for apps and other commercial links on your device if you\u2019re running ColorOS 6 and above, which could be anything from a popular game to a shopping site that\u2019s paid Realme for the advertising space. It sounds a little more intrusive than most other ads on devices since they\u2019ll just show up in places on your device, but there is an opt-out.\n\nRealme has detailed how you can go into settings and remove these recommendations from your phone so you won\u2019t have to keep dealing with them. Most people, however, probably won\u2019t be doing that, and that\u2019s the point. They see some ads, Realme makes some cash and gets to keep their phone costs low. I can understand the reasoning, but that doesn\u2019t make it suck any less.\n\nsource: Realme", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["accessories", "Android 12", "ads", "mediatek", "Qualcomm", "pixel 6", "Google", "Stadia", "motorola", "lenovo", "Realme", "Oppo", "Galaxy S22", "ColorOS", "Wear OS", "Chromebook"], "authors": ["Jared Peters"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Realme has very confidently announced that they'll be kicking off 2020 with a bang.
