A blind spot, if you will. Next fall, new consoles arrive. That doesn\u2019t affect us much on the PC side, but it does mean everyone\u2019s playing cards close to their chest at the moment. Holding onto surprises. Keeping quiet about quite possibly the biggest games of 2020.\n\nSo as we look towards the coming year, keep in mind we\u2019re only seeing half the picture\u2014if that.\n\nAnd yet it\u2019s still pretty damn impressive, with Cyberpunk 2077, Doom Eternal, and Dying Light II headlining one of the most packed spring lineups I\u2019ve ever seen. Oh, and lest we forget, there\u2019s a new Half-Life game releasing in March.\n\nThese are exciting times, friends.\n\nOri and the Will of the Wisps - March 11\n\nWhen Microsoft announced Ori and the Will of the Wisps at E3 2017, I don\u2019t think I ever imagined it would take until 2020 to release. Here we are though, and at least it\u2019s early 2020.\n\nRegardless, the second Ori outing looks every bit as beautiful as the original. It\u2019s got that same soft watercolor look, lots of dark blues specked with pink and green and red highlights. I\u2019ll be curious how the sequel ups the challenge for veterans without making it unapproachable for newcomers\u2014the original struck a tight balance. But either way, I can\u2019t wait to play it finally. It\u2019s more about the spectacle for me anyway.\n\nHalf-Life: Alyx - March\n\nNo, it\u2019s not Half-Life 3. After more than a decade, Valve\u2019s finally putting out a new Half-Life game though, one where you play as Alyx in the events leading up to Half-Life 2. A pre-sequel, to borrow a phrase from Borderlands.\n\nThe catch? It\u2019s VR exclusive, a showcase for Valve\u2019s Index headset\u2014and for Oculus, the Vive, or any other PC VR setup you might own. That\u2019s undoubtedly frustrating for anyone who hasn\u2019t made that investment yet, but perhaps Half-Life: Alyx can be as groundbreaking for VR as Half-Life 2 was for physics engines all those years ago. We\u2019ll see.\n\nDoom Eternal - March 20\n\nDoom Eternal was supposed to unleash hell last November, but fell victim to a last-minute delay. Now it\u2019s ripping and tearing its way through March instead.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, Doom Eternal is just \u201cMore Doom,\u201d and that\u2019s not a bad thing. With nearly four years separating the reboot and its sequel, I certainly haven\u2019t tired of semi-mindless run and guns, especially ones that play this slick. Hopefully it\u2019s been delayed for the last time, and we can all get to murdering demons in the near future.\n\nResident Evil 3 - April 3\n\nThe Resident Evil 2 remake was one of our favorite games of 2019. Using the core story beats of the 1998 original, the updated Resident Evil 2 reimagined Claire and Leon\u2019s adventure with a proper over-the-shoulder camera, a more grounded tone, and an ingenious map. It\u2019s the first Resident Evil game I\u2019ve ever truly loved.\n\nFor 2020, Capcom will try to work the same trick again and resurrect Resident Evil 3. I didn\u2019t expect it this soon, but nor am I complaining.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 - April 16\n\nWhen we saw the first Cyberpunk 2077 demo at E3 2018, I doubted it could run on current console hardware. I still doubt it, honestly.\n\nCD Projekt is determined to prove me wrong though, scheduling Cyberpunk 2077 to release in April. It seems impossible it could live up to the hype, seven years after the original teaser trailer and five years after The Witcher 3. But then again, I would\u2019ve said the same about The Witcher 3 and it\u2019s one of my favorite games this decade. Maybe the favorite.\n\nDying Light 2 - April?\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen nor heard much from Dying Light 2 since E3 2019. That\u2019s...worrisome. It\u2019s an ambitious game, and when ambitious games go radio silent I assume they\u2019ve been delayed.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised, either. Dying Light 2 is doing branching storylines on a massive scale. The demo we saw at E3 2019 ended with an entire district emerging from underwater, a section of the city you\u2019ll only see if you make certain choices along the way. As Techland put it, \u201cIt\u2019s not about which ending you get, but how the city looks when you finish the game,\u201d claiming you\u2019d only see 50 percent of the content in any given playthrough. Pretty cool, but it sounds like a lot of work.\n\nWasteland 3 - May 19\n\nFive years after Wasteland 2 took home our Game of the Year prize, the sequel\u2019s almost ready. What we\u2019ve played so far seemed very cold, with the Desert Rangers trading out sweltering Arizona for the frozen wastes of post-apocalyptic Colorado. It\u2019s still very much Wasteland though, with satisfying turn-based combat and skill checks galore. And given InXile\u2019s track record, I\u2019m sure the writing will be solid. My only hope is that the Microsoft acquisition gave InXile time not only to add more content, but to polish what was already there. I don\u2019t want to wait for the inevitable Director\u2019s Cut this time to get the game as InXile originally intended it.\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate III\n\nWill Baldur\u2019s Gate III release in 2020? I have my doubts. Google announced it as part of the Stadia launch lineup though, and Stadia has...technically launched. Theoretically that means Baldur\u2019s Gate III will also arrive in the near future. Theoretically.\n\nIf it does make it out, it\u2019ll be fortuitous timing. Baldur\u2019s Gate II turns 20 next year, a nice round anniversary worth celebrating with a long-awaited sequel. That said, I\u2019m happy to give Larian as much time as it needs. Following up one of the most beloved CRPGs of all time can\u2019t be easy.\n\nEmpire of Sin\n\nBrenda Romero\u2019s apparently waited decades to make Empire of Sin, a hybrid real-time strategy/turn-based tactics game set in the Prohibition Era. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s finally getting made, because it has some really neat ideas.\n\nForemost among them is what Empire of Sin calls RPCs or \u201crecruitable player characters.\u201d These are your gang members, and they\u2019re not just faceless grunts. They have personalities, relationships with other characters, dreams and desires. You might recruit a character only to find out her lover\u2019s in a rival gang, and then be able to exploit that\u2014or have it come back to haunt you when she refuses to fire at her lover at a crucial moment. It\u2019s an interesting wrinkle to consider, though I\u2019m curious how often these situations will present themselves outside a demo. We\u2019ll see.\n\nNext page: 2020 games, continued", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "With new consoles due to arrive in November, there's a sizable gap in the 2020 release calendar at the moment\u2014but with Cyberpunk, Dying Light 2, and more already on their way?
