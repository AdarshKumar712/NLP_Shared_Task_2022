But with his smaller religious and nationalist allies, he secured only 58 seats in parliament, three short of the required 61-seat majority needed to form a new government.\n\nNetanyahu's opponents, led by Gantz, control a majority of seats. But beyond their shared animosity towards Netanyahu, there are deep divisions between these parties, which include Lieberman's secular, ultra-nationalist party and the Arab-led Joint List.\n\nCorruption trial\n\nGantz's announcement with Lieberman marked a step towards unifying those anti-Netanyahu forces, though it remains unclear whether they can reach a final agreement, much less a deal with Arab politicians.\n\nLieberman has, in the past, branded Arab political leaders as \"terrorist\" sympathisers.\n\n\"We'll continue to discuss the details, formulate our common objectives, and move forward,\" Gantz said.\n\nNetanyahu is desperate to remain as prime minister as he prepares to go on trial on March 17.\n\nHe has been charged with fraud, breach of trust, and accepting bribes in connection to a series of scandals that include accepting expensive gifts from wealthy friends and offering to exchange favours with powerful media moguls.\n\nThe long-ruling Israeli leader denies any wrongdoing.\n\nNetanyahu's lawyers requested a delay in the start of the trial, saying they need more time to review evidence. Prosecutors on Monday said they oppose any delays.\n\nIsrael's president, Reuven Rivlin, must decide by next week who to choose as the prime minister-designate.\n\nThe president typically chooses the candidate he deems has the best chance of forming a governing coalition.\n\nNetanyahu has defiantly insisted he won last week's election and accused his opponents of trying to \"steal the elections\" by aligning with Arab-led parties he claimed were hostile to the state.\n\n\"I promise you, I am not going anywhere,\" Netanyahu said over the weekend.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Blue and White Party leader Benny Gantz in talks with a smaller party to break deadlock after last week's elections.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/mritems/assets/images/touch-icon-iphone.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0 maximum-scale=1.0, minimal-ui", "guid": 200309142923204, "title": "Benjamin Netanyahu's rivals eye new government", "description": "Blue and White Party leader Benny Gantz in talks with a smaller party to break deadlock after last week's elections.", "og": {"title": "Benjamin Netanyahu's rivals eye new government", "description": "Blue and White Party leader Benny Gantz in talks with a smaller party to break deadlock after last week's elections.", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/benjamin-netanyahu-rivals-eye-government-200309142923204.html", "internalurl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/benjamin-netanyahu-rivals-eye-government-200309142923204.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/3/9/f9c06dc2d2d848ccae55383883a3d214_18.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 562}}, "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/benjamin-netanyahu-rivals-eye-government-200309142923204.html", "ShortURL": "https://aje.io/cpljg", "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/3/9/f9c06dc2d2d848ccae55383883a3d214_18.jpg", "twitter": {"title": "Benjamin Netanyahu's rivals eye new government", "description": "Blue and White Party leader Benny Gantz in talks with a smaller party to break deadlock after last week's elections.", "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/3/9/f9c06dc2d2d848ccae55383883a3d214_18.jpg", "account_id": 4970411, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@AJENews"}, "ContentType": "News", "news_keywords": "Israel, Middle East, Benjamin Netanyahu", "google-play-app": "app-id=net.aljazeera.english", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504847776"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/benjamin-netanyahu-rivals-eye-government-200309142923204.html"}
