The clip ends with Alloway walking away.\n\nA second video posted on social media and later deleted shows Alloway being punched and kicked on a sidewalk by a group of men on Monday afternoon who appear to have recognized him from the initial video.\n\nThe suspect took refuge at a corner store, where someone inside reported him to authorities. He was apprehended by police shortly afterward.\n\nIt's unclear whether Alloway has a lawyer to speak on his behalf.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["General news", "Online media", "Media", "Social media", "Arrests", "Crime", "Law and order", "New York", "United States", "North America", "New York City", "Bronx"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "The Associated Press", "January", "Min Read"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Police have arrested a man after a video surfaced showing him apparently trying to abduct a woman on the New York City subway", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "Police have arrested a man after a video surfaced showing him apparently trying to abduct a woman on the New York City subway", "keywords": "General news, Online media, Media, Social media, Arrests, Crime, Law and order, New York, United States, North America, New York City, Bronx", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
