and that could be one of the reasons as to why a stampede has happened,\" Beig said.\n\nThe assassination of Soleimani triggered a dramatic escalation of tensions in the region and marked the most significant confrontation between the United States and Iran in recent years.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Dozens killed in stampede at General Soleimani's funeral | newtimes", "rwanda news", "tnt", "rwanda", "kigali", "news", "east africa"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Jan  7 14:10:54 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NewTimesRwanda", "domain": "newtimes.co.rw", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/dozens-killed-stampede-general-soleimanis-funeral", "title": "Dozens killed in stampede at General Soleimani's funeral"}, "keywords": "Dozens killed in stampede at General Soleimani's funeral | newtimes,rwanda news,tnt,rwanda,kigali,news,east africa", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The New Times | Rwanda", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/dozens-killed-stampede-general-soleimanis-funeral", "title": "Dozens killed in stampede at General Soleimani's funeral", "updated_time": "2020-01-07T14:24:08+02:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/sites/default/files/main/articles/2020/01/07/soleiaman.jpg", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/sites/default/files/main/articles/2020/01/07/soleiaman.jpg", "type": "jpg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-07T14:10:54+02:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-07T14:24:08+02:00"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/dozens-killed-stampede-general-soleimanis-funeral"}
