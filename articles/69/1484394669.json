The 22-year old was with his five friends at New Colony when they heard the cries of a woman in a passing auto. Even as they took off on their motorbikes, the woman jumped out of the autorikshaw. Akesh and another friend continued to chase the autorickshaw. After a couple of kilometers, when Akesh tried to block the way of the autorickshaw, the vehicle knocked him off a causeway . Akesh had suffered head injuries.Kodanchery villagers had only good things to talk about Akesh, \u201cthe youth with no vices\u201d. He worked as a driver and took care of his parents. The villagers did not allow any vehicle on Kondanchery Road on his funeral day. \u201cThis village has never come together like this for anyone. Everything \u2014 Christmas, New year, local body elections \u2014 took a backseat. Nothing mattered to us for the past few days,\u201d said N Mohan, a neighbour.Akesh lived in one of the quarters occupied by scheduled castes who lived in a cluster within the village. But people across castes poured into the hospital when Akesh was undergoing treatment and offered financial and emotional support to his parents.The youngest of three siblings, Akesh dropped out after Class X to support his parents Thiyagaraj and Padmavathi who are farm labourers. He took up a job as a helper in a machinery company and later became a driver there.His employer, E D Munuswaamy said the relationship they shared was more than professional. \u201cI treated him like my son. His integrity at a young age surprised me. We retained him on our payroll even when we had to shut down our company for a brief period,\u201d Munuswaamy said.For the first time in several years, Christmas and New Year celebration at the TELC Church in Kondanchery were low-key affairs. In the village, there was no drunk revelry, no clashes.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Chennai news", "Chennai latest news", "Chennai news live", "Chennai news today", "Today news Chennai", "White Tiger", "Village", "Tiruvallur district", "causeway", "auto rickshaw"], "tags": ["village", "AIADMK", "Chennai weather", "Chennai rain", "DMK", "Jallikattu", "Panneerselvam", "Tiruvallur district", "MK Stalin", "Floods in Chennai", "causeway"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "As the world ushered in the new year with revelry, Kondanchery village in Tiruvallur district, 50km from Chennai, silently saluted the courage of a lo", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "As the world ushered in the new year with revelry, Kondanchery village in Tiruvallur district, 50km from Chennai, silently saluted the courage of a lo", "keywords": "Chennai news, Chennai latest news, Chennai news live, Chennai news today, Today news Chennai,White Tiger,Village,Tiruvallur district,causeway,auto rickshaw", "robots": "NOODP", "og": {"title": "Tamil Nadu: Village puts off celebration after local hero\u2019s death | Chennai News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/a-village-puts-off-celebration-after-local-heros-death/articleshow/73062521.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063216,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-515130,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "As the world ushered in the new year with revelry, Kondanchery village in Tiruvallur district, 50km from Chennai, silently saluted the courage of a lo", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/a-village-puts-off-celebration-after-local-heros-death/articleshow/73062521.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063216,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-515130,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "Tamil Nadu: Village puts off celebration after local hero\u2019s death | Chennai News - Times of India", "description": "As the world ushered in the new year with revelry, Kondanchery village in Tiruvallur district, 50km from Chennai, silently saluted the courage of a lo", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "news_keywords": "White Tiger,Village,Tiruvallur district,causeway,auto rickshaw", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/a-village-puts-off-celebration-after-local-heros-death/articleshow/73062521.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 227797153941209, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/a-village-puts-off-celebration-after-local-heros-death/articleshow/73062521.cms"}
