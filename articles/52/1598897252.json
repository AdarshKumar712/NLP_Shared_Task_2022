As of March 17, J-PAL has therefore suspended all research activities that contribute to in-person interactions in order to limit COVID-19 spread. Many other research organizations have done so or will do so soon. In order to disseminate expertise quickly and build on our combined networks, we are crowd-sourcing best practices on switching from in-person to surveying online or via phone.\n\nThis is a living document that aggregates crowd-sourced tips and factors to consider when conducting remote surveys (in particular phone surveys) while practicing social distancing. We will be updating this page regularly. Many thanks to those who have contributed to this collection thus far.\n\nDo you have experience conducting surveys online or via phone? You can contribute via this form.\n\nLast updated: April 7, 2020", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Authors"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/themes/custom/jpal/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": {"identifier": "@JPAL", "id": 361486440}}, "og": {"site_name": "Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)", "image": {"url": "https://www.povertyactionlab.org//themes/custom/jpal/assets/jpal-logo-sq.png"}}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.povertyactionlab.org/blog/3-20-20/best-practices-conducting-phone-surveys"}
