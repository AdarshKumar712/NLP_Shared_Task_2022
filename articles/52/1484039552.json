I will be standing down in 2023 and will not be available in any future elections.\n\n\u201cBut I am determined to help strengthen the electoral process both in Nigeria and across the region, where several ECOWAS members go to the polls this year,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn security, the president said: \u201cAs Commander-in-Chief, my primary concern is the security of the nation and the safety of our citizens.\n\n\u201cWhen I assumed office in May 2015 my first task was to rally our neighbours so that we could confront Boko Haram on a coordinated regional basis. Chaos is not a neighbour any of us hope for.\n\n\u201cWe have been fighting on several fronts: violent extremists, cultists and organised criminal networks. It has not been easy.\n\n\u201cBut as we are winning the war, we also look to the challenge of winning the peace, the reconstruction of lives, communities and markets.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to the president, the North East Development Commission will work with local and international stakeholders to help create a new beginning for the region.\n\nHe also expressed government\u2019s readiness to continue to work with State Governors, neighbouring countries and the international partners to tackle the root causes of violent extremism and the networks that help finance and organise terror.\n\n\u201cOur security forces will receive the best training and modern weaponry, and in turn will be held to the highest standards of professionalism and respect for human rights.\n\n\u201cWe will use all the human and emerging technological resources available to tackle kidnapping, banditry and armed robbery.\n\n\u201cThe new Ministry of Police Affairs increased recruitment of officers and the security reforms being introduced will build on what we are already delivering.\n\n\u201cWe will work tirelessly at home and with our allies in support of our policies to protect the security of life and property,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nBuhari maintained that his administration\u2019s actions would be governed by the rule of law as well as engagement with well-meaning leaders and citizens to promote dialogue, partnership and understanding.\n\n\u201cWe need a democratic government that can guarantee peace and security to realise the full potential of our ingenious, entrepreneurial and hard-working people.\n\n\u201cOur policies are designed to promote genuine, balanced growth that delivers jobs and rewards industry.\n\n\u201cOur new Economic Advisory Council brings together respected and independent thinkers to advise me on a strategy that champions inclusive and balanced growth and above all fight poverty and safeguard national economic interests.\n\n\u201cAs we have sat down to celebrate with friends and family over this holiday season, for the first time in a generation our food plates have not all been filled with imports of products we know can easily be produced here at home,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe also noted that the nation\u2019s revolution in agriculture had become a reality in all corners of the country.\n\nThe president expressed the hope that the new agreements with Morocco, Russia and others would help access on attractive terms the inputs the country needed to accelerate the transformation in farming.\n\n\u201cA good example of commitment to this inclusive growth is the signing of the African Continental Free Trade Area and the creation of the National Action Committee to oversee its implementation and ensure the necessary safeguards are in place to allow us to fully capitalise on regional and continental markets.\n\n\u201cThe joint land border security exercise currently taking place is meant to safeguard Nigeria\u2019s economy and security. No one can doubt that we have been good neighbours and good citizens.\n\n\u201cWe have been the helpers and shock-absorbers of the sub-region but we cannot allow our well-planned economic regeneration to be sabotaged.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we are satisfied that the safeguards are adequate, normal cross-border movements will be resumed,\u2019\u2019 he added.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 15:31:33 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.5", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "I won\u2019t contest in 2023, President Buhari insists", "url": "https://promptnewsonline.com/i-wont-contest-in-2023-president-buhari-insists/", "description": "President Muhammadu Buhari has reiterated his intention not to contest the 2023 presidential elections but determined to help strengthen the electoral process both in Nigeria and across Economic Co\u2026", "site_name": "Prompt News", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/promptnewsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/images-65-e1570626489201.jpeg?fit=400%2C267&ssl=1", "width": 400, "height": 267}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T15:31:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T15:31:36+00:00"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@PromptNewso", "site": "@PromptNewso", "text": {"title": "I won\u2019t contest in 2023, President Buhari insists"}, "image": "https://i2.wp.com/promptnewsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/images-65-e1570626489201.jpeg?fit=400%2C267&ssl=1&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "canonical_link": "https://promptnewsonline.com/i-wont-contest-in-2023-president-buhari-insists/"}
