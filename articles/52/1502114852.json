Bilawal blamed the Federal government for the inefficiency of Sindh government irrespective the fact that the PPP did not resolve the people\u2019s problems in the province despite ruling it for the last 11 years, she added.\n\nTo a question about alleged dual nationality of Federal Minister Faisal Vawda, she said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) did not give verdicts on the wishes of people. If someone had proofs against Vawda, he should knock the doors of ECP and if proven guilty, the government would stand by the law and not by its legislator.\n\nTo another question, she said flour was available in Punjab but a section of the media was projecting only one-sided news. Stern action was being taken against the hoarders and anybody involved in the crime would not be spared. The prices of both flour and sugar would come down in next few days as the government has taken steps in that regard, she added.\n\nThe SAPM said the unanimous approval of the names of Chief Election Commissioner and ECP members manifested that the Parliament was playing its due role as a true democratic institution. Both the government and the opposition showed responsibility and with consultation named the new CEC in the larger national interest.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["reality", "rift", "firdous"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "ISLAMABAD: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan on Tuesday said the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid  was an ally of the Pakistan...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "TITLE": "No reality in PTI-PML-Q rift: Firdous | Pakistan | thenews.com.pk", "description": "ISLAMABAD: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan on Tuesday said the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid  was an ally of the Pakistan...", "keywords": "reality,rift,firdous", "fb": {"app_id": 650123461797330}, "og": {"title": "No reality in PTI-PML-Q rift: Firdous", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 390}, "description": "ISLAMABAD: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan on Tuesday said the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid  was an ally of the Pakistan...", "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/602401-no-reality-in-pti-pml-q-rift-firdous", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thenews_intl", "creator": "@AAPP", "title": "No reality in PTI-PML-Q rift: Firdous", "description": "ISLAMABAD: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan on Tuesday said the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid  was an ally of the Pakistan...", "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=040708"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The News International", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#333333", "theme-color": "#000000"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/602401-no-reality-in-pti-pml-q-rift-firdous"}
