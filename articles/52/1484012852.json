the North Londoners have now lost four consecutive home games for the first time in 60 years, including three in a row in the league for the first time since 1977, while they have conceded at least twice in each of their last five matches at the Emirates \u2013 their worst such run since 1965.\n\nThe wait for a victory at the Emirates now stretches back seven games to October \u2013 their longest streak since 1995 \u2013 and only five teams have picked up fewer points in front of their own fans in the league this season.\n\nSunday\u2019s defeat means that they have now lost as many home league games in their last three outings as they had in their previous 37, and worryingly such stats go on and on.\n\nAll of that has contributed to Arsenal beginning 2020 in 12th place and just six points clear of the relegation zone, with 11 points separating them from the final Champions League spot despite those above them also having struggled for consistency this season.\n\nThe Gunners were 14 points better off at the same stage of last season, whereas at the start of the last decade they were still challenging for the Premier League title \u2013 something they are a whopping 31 points off doing right now.\n\nThat said, the theme of the mighty falling by no means applies to just Arsenal; this would have been a top-two battle at the beginning of the 2010s, but now you could add Arsenal and United\u2019s points together and they would only be level with league leaders Liverpool.\n\nUnited have at least been better than Arsenal this season, and they ended 2019 in promising fashion with wins over Newcastle United and Burnley helping to make up for their shock defeat at Watford just before Christmas.\n\nConsistency has been a major issue for the Red Devils and they have not won three consecutive league games for almost a year, but they have also only lost one of their last nine matches and have been beaten the same number of times as champions Manchester City this term.\n\nIndeed, only Liverpool picked up more points than United over the last six games of 2019, helping them to close the gap on the Champions League places to four points.\n\nThe Red Devils have a difficult start to the New Year with Arsenal, Wolverhampton Wanderers twice, Man City twice, Liverpool and Chelsea to come in their first nine games of 2020, although it is those matches which have showcased the best of Solskjaer\u2019s side so far this season.\n\nUnited have beaten the likes of Man City, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Leicester City, as well as being the only team to take points off Liverpool, yet they have lost to Crystal Palace, West Ham United, Newcastle United, Bournemouth, Astana and Watford.\n\nIt is a damning indictment of Arsenal that many will consider them closer to the second batch of teams rather than the first right now, but the occasion and history of this rivalry could be enough to generate the big game fever which United seem to relish.\n\nSolskjaer\u2019s side will certainly need that away from home over the coming months considering that their next five away games see them travel to Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, Everton and Tottenham.\n\nRight now this trip to the Emirates looks like the easiest of the lot, although they will expect Arsenal to be much better than they have been for the most part in front of their own fans this season as Arteta once again goes in search of his first win.\n\nArsenal possible XI: Leno, Maitland-Niles, Mustafi, Luiz, Saka, Xhaka, Torreira, Nelson, Ozil, Aubameyang, Lacazette.\n\nMan U possible XI: De Gea, Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw, Fred, Matic, Greenwood, Pogba, Rashford, Martial.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Ole Gunnar Solskjaer", "Mikel Arteta", "Manchester United", "london"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 11:31:22 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/TEO-icon-55x55.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "theme-color": "#cc0000", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#cc0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "#cc0000", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "EPL: Gunners, Red Devils face off in London", "site_name": "The Eagle Online", "description": "Arsenal vs. Man United Venue: Emirates Stadium Kick off: 9PM The New Year gets underway in style as Arsenal and", "url": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/epl-gunners-red-devils-face-off-in-london/", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mikel-Arteta.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 615}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T11:31:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T11:31:22+00:00", "section": "Football", "tag": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "EPL: Gunners, Red Devils face off in London", "description": "Arsenal vs. Man United Venue: Emirates Stadium Kick off: 9PM The New Year gets underway in style as Arsenal and", "url": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/epl-gunners-red-devils-face-off-in-london/", "image": {"src": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mikel-Arteta.jpg", "width": 615, "height": 409}}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "fb": {"pages": 245777418823519}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/TEO-icon.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng"}
