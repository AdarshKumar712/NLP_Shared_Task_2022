The poll of 628 registered voters included 292 Democrats, 251 Republicans and 85 independents. It was conducted Jan. 21-26 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 6.2 percentage points.\n\nThe poll found that 38 percent believe Trump is doing a good or excellent job \u2014 slightly higher than in October.\n\nMeanwhile, the preferred presidential candidate among Democrats in Pennsylvania has grown murkier since October. Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead, favored by 22 percent of Democrats; but he had been favored by 30 percent of Democrats in the last F&M poll in October.\n\nBiden is followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, favored by 15 percent (up from 12 percent in October), and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, favored by 14 percent (down from 18 percent in October).\n\nThat cluster is followed by former mayors Mike Bloomberg, favored by 7 percent, and Pete Buttigieg, favored by 6 percent.\n\nRegarding Trump\u2019s favorability rating, the poll authors note it\u2019s similar to that of former President Barack Obama at the same point in his successful re-election campaign.\n\nAs usual, Trump is far more popular among Republicans, with 77 percent having a positive view of his performance, as opposed to 31 percent of independents and eight percent of Democrats.\n\nOverall, 57 percent of those surveyed said it\u2019s time for a different president and, of those, 87 percent said they will vote against Trump no matter what.\n\nRegarding overall enthusiasm, people who consider themselves liberals show the most, with 78 percent saying they are highly interested. That compares to 68 percent of conservatives and 61 percent of moderates.\n\nSome of the poll participants agreed to be interviewed by the news media.\n\nBrian Taylor, a Philadelphia-area Democrat, says he plans to vote for Sanders because of \u201chis authenticity, his accountability and his consistency.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is also trying to take down money in politics, which is one of the biggest threats to our democracy in the modern age,\u201d said Taylor, 29, who works for a non-profit counseling people living with HIV.\n\nHe disagrees with those who argue only a moderate Democrat can defeat Trump. Rather, Sanders champions policies that benefit working people, which will win over people from both major parties and independents, according to Taylor.\n\nAndrew Maietta, an Allegheny County Democrat, says he leans toward Biden, adding \u201cI\u2019m not crazy\u201d about the policies of Sanders and Warren.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in favor of the free college and I think they are a little too far to the left,\u201d says Maietta, a retired professor of filmmaking.\n\nHe says he\u2019s also considering Sen. Amy Klobuchar, for reasons including his view her policies are \u201cmore centered,\u201d and she doesn\u2019t generate the level of disdain he believes many Republicans feel toward Democrats such as Biden or Hillary Clinton.\n\nRick Hall of McKean County is a registered Democrat who says he doesn\u2019t always vote as a Democrat and is \u201cunderwhelmed\u201d by the Democratic field. He further says \u201cI do not like Trump\u201d and Trump\u2019s handling of foreign policy \u201cscares the crap out of me.\u201d\n\nStill, he says \u201cunless the Democrats come up with something else, I\u2019ll have to vote for him.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Hall, who is 68 and retired after spending most of his career in the steel industry, believes Trump \u201chas done a good job\u201d on domestic issues including the economy.\n\nScott Mcgowan, a Libertarian, says \u201cTrump shoots his mouth off and creates problems.\u201d However, while stressing the election is still nearly a year away, he says, \u201cIf it was today it would be Trump\u201d getting his vote.\n\nSome other poll findings:\n\nJust over half of the voters surveyed believe Pennsylvania is \u201cheaded in the right direction,\u201d with 33 percent saying they are \u201cbetter off\u201d financially than a year ago, and a strong majority saying they expect to be the same or better off financially in a year.\n\nOn the other hand, only 38 percent believe the United States is headed in the right direction.\n\nForty-eight percent of voters support natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania, with 44 percent opposing it. However, 49 percent believe the environmental risks outweigh the economic benefits.\n\nForty-eight percent favor a ban on natural gas fracking, while 39 percent oppose a ban.\n\nMore from PennLive:\n\nListen to the latest episode of PennLive\u2019s political podcast, Battleground Pa., on your favorite app including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, and Google Podcasts.
