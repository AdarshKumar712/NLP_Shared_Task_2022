Two people were killed as a fire ripped through the small community of Cobargo, taking the death toll since the devastating fire season began several weeks ago to 12. Five others are missing.\n\nThere\u2019s no end in sight to the emergency as strong winds fan flames, wreaking havoc in popular tourist spots such as Batemans Bay during the peak summer holiday season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a truly awful day,\u201d New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters, adding that the fire season was the worst in the state\u2019s history. \u201cWe\u2019ve got literally hundreds, thousands of people up and down the coast, taking refuge on the beaches, in clubhouses, surf clubs.\u201d\n\nThe crisis gripping the world\u2019s driest-inhabited continent has impacted all six states amid a prolonged drought. Almost 4 million hectares of forest and bushland have been destroyed in New South Wales alone. Fires are so intense they are generating their own weather systems, with dry thunderstorms sparking new blazes. A firefighter was killed on Monday when what authorities described as a \u201cfire tornado\u201d flipped the 10-ton truck he was in.\n\nThe emergency has placed scrutiny on Australia\u2019s capacity to combat blazes that have spread over massive areas, pushing fire services largely manned by volunteers to their limits. It\u2019s also put international focus on the conservative government\u2019s climate change policies, with environmentalists saying Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s support of the nation\u2019s massive coal-export industry has worsened conditions.\n\nEnergy Minister Angus Taylor defended the government\u2019s record of tackling climate change in an op-ed published in The Australian on Tuesday, saying emissions had fallen in the past year and Australia was meeting its carbon-reduction targets.\n\n\u201cShrill cries that we should be \u2018ashamed to be Australian\u2019 do not ring true with the quiet Australians,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat won\u2019t stop some commentators telling us that we should feel guilty about our performance on emissions reduction. They are wrong.\u201d\n\nWhile fires have been burning for weeks, conditions worsened at the weekend as a heatwave pushed temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius in the southeast. Authorities on Sunday urged some 30,000 holiday-makers in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland region to evacuate. Thousands did, but those who remained found themselves trapped as the blazes intermittently shut the main highway.\n\nAustralia\u2019s government will deploy helicopters, aircraft and navy ships to assist efforts in the East Gippsland region, Linda Reynolds, the nation\u2019s defense minister, tweeted Tuesday.\n\nAbout 4,000 people were forced to gather on the foreshore or take to boats in the town of Mallacoota overnight and through much of the day as an out-of-control inferno bore down on the remote community.\n\n\u201cA mother took this photo. Her two primary school aged sons are in the boat with her.\n\nThey\u2019re out on the #Mallacoota lake trying to stay safe from fire, it doesn\u2019t look like it \u2013 but it\u2019s daytime.\u201d ~ABC Gippsland.#bushfirecrisis #vicfires #NSWfires #Bushfires #bushfiresVIC pic.twitter.com/CqA1FgMM02\n\n\u2014 Fiona Bateman (@feebateman) Dec. 31, 2019\n\nCountry Fire Authority chief officer Steve Warrington said a cheer went up from the jetty where many were sheltering as authorities battling spotfires in the town announced the wind had changed and the main threat had passed.\n\nAcross the state border in New South Wales, buildings in Batemans Bay caught fire as thousands sheltered on the beach and ash rained down on the picturesque beachside town of Merimbula.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an a very long, difficult and dangerous night still ahead,\u2019 Fitzsimmons said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be another difficult day again tomorrow.\u201d\n\nBatemans Bay CBD has lost power and is pitch black at 12.20pm. pic.twitter.com/cPry7nsBHL\n\n\u2014 Andrea Cantle (@AndreaCantle) Dec. 31, 2019\n\nWhile cities such as Canberra and Parramatta canceled fireworks celebrations to bring in the new year, Sydney\u2019s harborside festivities that draw in tens of thousands of tourists will go ahead.\n\nThe city council rejected a petition calling for the display to be scrapped and the money to be donated to bushfire and drought relief projects, saying the event is watched by millions of people worldwide and generates A$130 million ($91 million) for the local economy.\n\nAs thousands of people gathered along the foreshore of Sydney harbor to get a prime viewing spot of the midnight fireworks, smoke drifting in from bushfires caused a polluting haze.\n\nProtesters who claim the Morrison government\u2019s pro-coal mining policies are exacerbating the crisis aren\u2019t about to give the prime minister a rest on New Year\u2019s Eve and are planning to block roads around his official Sydney residence.\n\nPhotograph: A New South Wales (NSW) Rural Fire Service vehicle moves along the closed Princes Highway in Batemans Bay.
