The time off may be spread out in the fall to accommodate sports schedules.\n\n\u201cWe know teacher burnout is a problem,\u201d Cagle said. \u201cWe know student burnout is a problem. And when teachers and students are able to have that instructional time and then have a time of rest\u2026 We feel they\u2019re looking at that as a positive and that will assist them and us moving forward.\u201d\n\nThe school year would still last 180 days for students and 190 days for teachers. The time of day school is scheduled for would not change, either.\n\nThe district sent out a survey last week that Cagle said showed favorable results from stakeholders and staff members. She said 83 percent of staff were interested in learning more and 73% of stakeholders responded favorably.\n\nSome on social media criticized the survey because stakeholders could cast multiple submissions. Cagle said the district stood behind the integrity of the survey.\n\nThe idea was inspired by Timrod Elementary, which has been using a modified schedule since 2015. The school\u2019s principal says since then she\u2019s seen a drop in disciplinary issues, an increase in student achievement, among other perks.\n\n\u201cBefore we moved to the modified calendar, we had a hard time recruiting teachers,\u201d Principal Michelle McBride said. \u201cNow we have an overwhelming amount of teachers who want to come to Timrod because of our new schedule.\u201d\n\nShe said the schedule has worked well for the school.\n\n\u201cWe have fully embraced our calendar and we can\u2019t see ourselves going back to a regular calendar because we\u2019ve had so much success on the modified calendar,\u201d she said.\n\nThe schedule could go into effect as soon as the 2020-2021 school year for the entire district. A final decision is expected to be made at the next board meeting.
