His mother is addicted to drugs and in the past has stolen his money and medications. His sister is developmentally delayed. He doesn\u2019t have any caregivers and has been living independently for years.\u201d She paused, giving me space to absorb this. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tricky for him to get through all of his therapy.\u201d\n\nAdolescents and young adults, which in medicine we define as ages 15 to 39, are a special population of patients with respect to the types of cancers they commonly get and the biology of those cancers. They also have distinct concerns from older or younger cancer patients, including unique issues surrounding their emerging identities, body image and autonomy. They are caught in the no-man\u2019s land between being treated by adult oncologists, who may not be sensitive to these concerns, or by pediatric oncologists, where they may feel out of place sitting in an infusion chair receiving treatment next to a child.\n\nI walked into my patient\u2019s room, where he lay in his hospital bed, looking almost too fragile to be able to handle this huge mass lesion, never mind the chemotherapy I was about to propose. Slight, at five-and-a-half feet and 125 pounds, his face appeared even smaller, with a thick, black beard, oxygen tubing beneath his nose, and a snapback trucker baseball cap over his head. Tattoos covered both of his arms \u2014 a style element that my teenage children tell me is now considered normative. Another young man sat in the chair by his bed.\n\nI discussed his diagnosis and its treatment. \u201cThe first course of chemotherapy we\u2019ll give you in the hospital. After that, over the next few months, we\u2019ll provide most of your care as an outpatient, meaning you\u2019ll need to come back and forth to clinic a bunch of times.\u201d I paused, giving him space to absorb this. \u201cIs that something you can do?\u201d\n\nHe nodded and gestured with his thumb toward his buddy, sitting in the chair beside him. \u201cThese guys will help me out.\u201d He sounded confident.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Mikkael A.
