Bill Kalina photo (Photo: Bill Kalina, The York Dispatch)\n\nSouth Western also did not meet previous eligibility requirements, but officials had decided to provide free meals anyway and seek reimbursement later, said Assistant Superintendent Daniel Hartman.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t want the red tape to hold us back from providing lunches,\" he said.\n\nHartman was unsure if the district had applied for the new waiver.\n\n\u201cSchools and community organizations can now use recent and local economic data, including unemployment claims and business closures, to request approval from PDE to qualify as an open meal site,\u201d Vonda Ramp, the Education Department's state director for child nutrition programs, said in a news release Monday.\n\n\u201cOnce approved, they can provide meals to all children in their community, age 18 and under, for free.\u201d\n\nThere are already approximately 1,600 food distribution sites across the state, which is expected to increase because of the waiver.\n\nOther districts such as West York Area, Central and West Shore already had summer meal programs that allowed them to serve meals communitywide regardless of economic status, so they have continued to do so.\n\nNow, thanks to new legislation that does not require children to be in the car to receive lunches, parents and guardians can come pick up their meals, West Shore spokeswoman Rhonda Fourhman said in an email.\n\nStudents now are busy during the day doing schoolwork, as online learning for most began Monday.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf has closed all schools \"indefinitely\" to help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\u2014 Ron Musselman can be reached at rmusselman@yorkdispatch.com or via Twitter at @ronmusselman8\n\nBuy Photo Fresh vinyl gloves are at the ready during the school lunch program at Dallastown High School Monday, March 16, 2020.
