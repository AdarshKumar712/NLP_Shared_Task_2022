Watching our neighborhoods and wild places burn is a somber warning of the further destruction that will occur if we stay on our current course. Unless we stop developing the fossil fuels that are driving the climate crisis, we will ensure that the fires and other disasters that threaten our communities become even more common and more severe.\n\nYet in the face of these disasters here and around the world, the Trump administration is rushing to auction off as much of America\u2019s public lands as possible for oil and gas drilling, including in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where they plan to hold a lease sale in the coming months. At a time when we need to be moving away from fossil fuels, we cannot be complicit in this administration\u2019s plans to spoil one of America\u2019s last wild places for the sake of expanded development of polluting oil and gas.\n\nFor that reason, I\u2019m glad to see the cities of Oakland, San Francisco, and Berkeley \u2014 with the support of leaders like San Francisco Supervisors Norman Yee, Aaron Peskin and Hillary Ronen, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arregu\u00edn and Berkeley Council Member Sophie Hahn, and Oakland Council Member Rebecca Kaplan \u2014 reaffirm their support of resolutions that ensure they will not do business with any company that seeks to drill in the Arctic Refuge.\n\nThese resolutions reflect the opinion of the American public, which overwhelmingly and across party lines opposes drilling in the Arctic Refuge. In fact, the only way drilling advocates in Congress were able to undo decades of protections for this place was by tacking on an unrelated provision to the 2017 tax bill opening up the refuge\u2019s coastal plain for oil drilling.\n\nAs if the threat to our global climate were not bad enough, drilling in the Arctic Refuge would also violate the human rights of the Gwich\u2019in people, who have relied on the land and wildlife there for their survival and way of life for thousands of years. The Gwich\u2019in, who refer to the coastal plain as \u201cthe sacred place where life begins,\u201d depend on the caribou herd that migrates through the coastal plain for 80% of their diet. Any disturbance to this ecosystem would pose an existential threat to this community.\n\nPut simply, drilling in the Arctic Refuge is a terrible idea. It would threaten Indigenous rights, industrialize one of America\u2019s last wild places, and exacerbate climate change. Any company foolish enough to ignore these risks is not one we want to be associated with.\n\nThe Arctic may be far away, but we only have to look as far as the fires raging in our own backyard to know that what happens there can be felt right here in the Bay Area. We should be leading the way to a clean energy future. Our tax dollars should not support a toxic investment in the dirty fuels of the past.\n\nMinda Berbeco is director of the Sierra Club San Francisco Bay Chapter.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Minda Berbeco", "Anna Bauman", "Jill Tucker", "J.K.
