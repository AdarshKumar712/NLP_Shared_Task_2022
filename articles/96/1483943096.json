Just as we take particular pride and ownership in our 2019 accomplishments, we must acknowledge and bear our responsibility, individually and nationally, for the much that has gone wrong.\u201d\n\nShe said the challenges we faced such as crime, unemployment, road fatalities and racism, will define us unless every individual, office-holder and agency admitted its role, stopped the blame game, and committed to doing their duty.\n\n\u201cBoundless faith in our destiny means little unless we are prepared to do the necessary works. Whether we hold the office of president, minister of government; minister of religion, clerk, or that most important office of citizen, we each have a responsibility to make a contribution to the healthy development of our nation.\u201d\n\nWeekes described citizenship as a contact sport. She said no one had the luxury of being a casual observer or bystander or member of the audience, and had every right to comment, criticise and complain. However, we did not have the right to do nothing more. She said her duty was to focus on nation-building\u2014national consciousness, national involvement and national pride.\n\n\u201cMany in our population seem to think that all must be right with us before we can take pride in our nation. I venture to suggest that those people are putting the cart before the horse. Perhaps when we identify and treasure our many blessings as a nation, we will do our part to encourage and develop the good, reject the unacceptable, hold our public officials to account, and ensure that there is much of which to be proud.\u201d\n\nThe President said in the new year the Office of the President will embark upon a series of visits to schools nationwide in a programme called Inform, Educate, Engage, with the aim of \u201cigniting the fire of national pride in the young people of our nation.\u201d\n\nThis, she said, will run concurrently with Citizen True, a four-year youth development programme aimed at creating committed citizens, which was launched in May 2019. Two other initiatives, First Females and Youth-Truth to Power, will also come on-stream this year.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Carol Matroo"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/themes/newsday/images/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Do not despair", "description": "President\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day message to TT", "url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2020/01/01/do-not-despair/", "site_name": "Trinidad and Tobago Newsday", "image": {"identifier": "https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5851408.jpg", "secure_url": "https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5851408.jpg", "width": 743, "height": 865}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ttnewsday", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T07:24:51+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "President\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day message to TT", "title": "Do not despair", "site": "@newsday_tt", "image": "https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5851408.jpg", "creator": "@newsday_tt"}, "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "https://newsday.co.tt", "fb": {"app_id": 136282246989460}}, "canonical_link": "https://newsday.co.tt/2020/01/01/do-not-despair/"}
