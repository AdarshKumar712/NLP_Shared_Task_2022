Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it\u2019s not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. We also tend to see lower insider ownership in companies that were previously publicly owned.\n\nInvestec Australia Property Fund is a smaller company with a market capitalization of R9.0b, so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors. In the chart below, we can see that institutional investors have bought into the company. Let\u2019s take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholder can tell us about Investec Australia Property Fund.\n\nView 4 warning signs we detected for Investec Australia Property Fund\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Investec Australia Property Fund?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it\u2019s included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nInvestec Australia Property Fund already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 55% of the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can\u2019t rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Investec Australia Property Fund, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Investec Australia Property Fund is not owned by hedge funds. Investec Asset Management Limited is currently the largest shareholder, with 12% of shares outstanding. With 9.0% and 3.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, Investec Property Fund Limited and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 19 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no one share holder has a majority.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, It also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. While there is some analyst coverage, the company is probably not widely covered. So it could gain more attention, down the track.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Investec Australia Property Fund\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board; and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board, themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nWe can see that insiders own shares in Investec Australia Property Fund. In their own names, insiders own R102m worth of stock in the R9.0b company. There\u2019s no doubt that we learn useful information from looking at a company\u2019s ownership structure and shareholders. But ultimately, many risks exist within the business itself, rather than its shareholders. For example, we\u2019ve discovered 4 warning signs for Investec Australia Property Fund (of which 1 is major) which any shareholder or potential investor should be aware of.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 37% ownership, the general public have some degree of sway over IAP. While this group can\u2019t necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nPrivate Company Ownership\n\nOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 5.9%, of the company\u2019s shares. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.\n\nMany find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.
