Making that point clearer is Blue Story, an acclaimed UK film that's finally hitting select theaters in America later this month.\n\nThe directorial debut from writer/director Andrew Onwubolu (aka Rapman, who caught the eye of JAY-Z, leading to an affiliation with Roc Nation), Blue Story is like a UK version of Boyz n the Hood or Juice. It features Micheal Ward, who blew everyone's mind when Top Boy hit Netflix, and delves into a friendship between two friends from opposite boroughs in London. It's no joke; you learn early on that things get hectic when clans clash, leading to tragic ends and insane realizations. It's a provocative look at London youth right now, especially from impoverished areas, all conducted by Rapman, who himself makes interesting appearances throughout the film, guiding the story along.\n\nThe intoxicating Blue Story hits theaters in New York on March 20, followed by openings in Los Angeles on March 27. Check out the official U.S. trailer above, then check out the synopsis (and the official poster) below.\n\nBest friends Timmy (Stephen Odubola) and Marco (Micheal Ward) go to the same high school in Peckham, but live in neighboring London boroughs. When Marco\u2019s beaten up by one of Timmy\u2019s primary school friends the two boys wind up on rival sides of a never-ending cycle of gang war in which there are no winners \u2026 only victims.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Movies", "Shows", "trailer", "Blue Story", "Music", "Paramount", "Style", "Pop Culture", "Paramount Pictures", "Sports", "Sneakers", "Life"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Watch the official U.S. trailer for 'Blue Story', which hits U.S. theaters later this month.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/v1403733167/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "ICK39wBGvCQQMHpEUykVHWF8Ox_0MME-_qxe6ixFUik", "theme-color": "#000000", "description": "Watch the official U.S. trailer for 'Blue Story', which hits U.S. theaters later this month.", "og": {"type": "website", "title": "Premiere: Watch the Official U.S. Trailer for 'Blue Story'", "description": "Watch the official U.S. trailer for 'Blue Story', which hits U.S. theaters later this month.", "url": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2020/03/bue-story-us-trailer-premiere", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/g7vmtv6wwska8bqk0ien/blue-story", "site_name": "Complex"}, "fb": {"app_id": 310521533114641, "pages": 117696581735620}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Premiere: Watch the Official U.S. Trailer for 'Blue Story'", "description": "Watch the official U.S. trailer for 'Blue Story', which hits U.S. theaters later this month.", "url": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2020/03/bue-story-us-trailer-premiere", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,g_center,h_300,q_auto,w_600/fl_lossy,pg_1/g7vmtv6wwska8bqk0ien/blue-story", "site": {"id": 13049362}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2020/03/bue-story-us-trailer-premiere"}
