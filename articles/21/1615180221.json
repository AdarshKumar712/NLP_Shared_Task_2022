Earlier this week French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel proposed a 500-billion-euro ($546 billion) fund to mend an economy devastated by the pandemic.\n\nThe fact that Germany signed up to a plan involving jointly-issued debt was seen as a historic turning point for the European Union given Berlin\u2019s longstanding commitment to balanced public finances. But the so-called \u201cfrugal four\u201d continue to insist there must be no \u201cmutualisation of debt\u201d\u2014a process they believe would let the less disciplined and weaker EU economies get an undue benefit of cheaper funding on the back of their stronger northern peers.\n\nThe proposal published on Saturday says that support for economic recovery should be accompanied by \u201ca strong commitment to reforms and the fiscal framework\u201d\u2014a key obligation for recipient states.\n\nThe four countries also say it will be necessary to \u201cprotect spending from fraud\u201d by closely involving European prosecutors and anti-corruption officials. The proposal rejects the prospect of any \u201csignificant increases\u201d to the EU\u2019s budget, as envisaged by the Macron-Merkel plan to fund the recovery programme.\n\nInstead it says the EU budget should be \u201cmodernized\u201d and that savings could be achieved \u201cby reprioritising in areas that are less likely to contribute to the recovery\u201d.\n\nIn contrast, Covid-19-related expenditure could be frontloaded or temporarily topped up, the proposal says. Given the gloomy economic forecasts for this year, \u201cadditional funds for the EU, regardless of how they are financed, will strain national budgets even further,\u201d the four countries say.\n\nNext week the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, is set to present its own plan for how to stimulate economic recovery after the crisis.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["frugal", "present", "proposal", "virus"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "VIENNA: Four EU countries dubbing themselves the \u201cfrugal four\u201d presented their own proposal on Saturday for post-coronavirus economic recovery, restating their rejection of any...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "TITLE": "EU \u2018frugal four\u2019 present own proposal for virus aid | Top Story | thenews.com.pk", "description": "VIENNA: Four EU countries dubbing themselves the \u201cfrugal four\u201d presented their own proposal on Saturday for post-coronavirus economic recovery, restating their rejection of any...", "keywords": "frugal,present,proposal,virus", "fb": {"app_id": 650123461797330}, "og": {"title": "EU \u2018frugal four\u2019 present own proposal for virus aid", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 390}, "description": "VIENNA: Four EU countries dubbing themselves the \u201cfrugal four\u201d presented their own proposal on Saturday for post-coronavirus economic recovery, restating their rejection of any...", "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/662956-eu-frugal-four-present-own-proposal-for-virus-aid", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thenews_intl", "creator": "@AFP", "title": "EU \u2018frugal four\u2019 present own proposal for virus aid", "description": "VIENNA: Four EU countries dubbing themselves the \u201cfrugal four\u201d presented their own proposal on Saturday for post-coronavirus economic recovery, restating their rejection of any...", "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=074229"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The News International", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#333333", "theme-color": "#000000"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/662956-eu-frugal-four-present-own-proposal-for-virus-aid"}
