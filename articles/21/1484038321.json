(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)\n\nSACRAMENTO \u2014 Paul George and Kawhi Leonard had far more success passing the ball in the first half than they did shooting it \u2013 and the Clippers still put up nearly 60 points.\n\nThat, as Leonard pointed out afterward, bodes well for a franchise in serious pursuit of its first NBA championship.\n\nGeorge had 21 points with season-highs of 11 rebounds and nine assists to shake off a slow start, and the short-handed Clippers thumped the Sacramento Kings 105-87 on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nLeonard scored 14 of his 24 points in the third quarter to help the Clippers to their 14th consecutive win in Sacramento dating to 2013.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what championship teams are about,\u201d said Leonard, who led Toronto to the title a year ago before signing with the Clippers in hopes of bringing them their first championship.\n\n\u201cGoing through playoff runs, the best players aren\u2019t going to play great some nights. It might be somebody off the bench or somebody (else) starting that has a big game that propels us to win.\u201d\n\nIvica Zubac added eight points and 13 rebounds and Maurice Harkless scored 12 points for the Clippers. The visitors also got a big lift from Larry Shamet and Derrick Walton Jr., who combined for 19 points.\n\nThat was pivotal on a night when George shot 6 for 25 and Leonard was 8 for 21.\n\n\u201cWe just kind of hung in there,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cWe went zone a little bit and changed our look. I just like our defense.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers played without Patrick Beverley and sixth man Lou Williams. Beverley is expected to miss several games while nursing a sprained right wrist he injured during Saturday night\u2019s loss in Utah, while Williams missed the game because of personal reasons.\n\nRichaun Holmes had 22 points and 10 rebounds for Sacramento, which has lost eight straight.\n\n\u201cThey pushed us around out there and they had their way,\u201d Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. \u201cWe have to come together and we\u2019ve got to be mentally stronger, physically stronger and fight our way out of it. That\u2019s the only way to get out of this type of slump that we\u2019re in, and we\u2019ve done it before.\u201d\n\nThree days after a 13-point loss to Utah, the Clippers took control in the first half despite both George and Leonard struggling offensively. The All-Stars missed 17 of their first 24 shots combined.\n\nBoth got going after the break.\n\nLeonard made five of seven shots in the third quarter, and George \u2013 who missed eight of his first nine shots beyond the arc \u2013 made a 3-pointer to open the fourth. George added another 3-pointer later that put the Clippers ahead 103-86.\n\n\u201cI had the mindset of just go and attack, be aggressive, be physical,\u201d George said. \u201cI got the spots I wanted to. I got to the shots I wanted to. But it\u2019s just that stretch for me right now where the ball\u2019s not going down.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles Clippers confident Paul George\u2019s shots will start falling\n\nPaul George, Clippers unveil new courts in Palmdale\n\nClippers\u2019 Patrick Beverley takes a tumble in loss to Jazz\n\nCoach Doc Rivers a \u2018fan\u2019 of Jazz\u2019s Jordan Clarkson from way back\n\nTraffic, noise from new LA Clippers arena would be \u2018significant\u2019 and \u2018unavoidable,\u2019 report says Even with Leonard and George struggling most of the first half, the Clippers still built a big lead on the slumping Kings late in the second quarter. Shamet\u2019s 3-pointer gave the Clippers a 57-40 halftime lead.\n\nLeonard got going in the third and the Clippers went on a 9-2 run to extend their lead to 19. Montrezl Harrell tipped in an offensive rebound then made a pair of free throws that made it 85-66.\n\nWIN, THEN LOSE, THEN WIN\n\nThe Clippers have alternated wins and losses over the past nine games. George said that\u2019s indicative of a team with new players still trying to adjust.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve probably got one game under our belt where everybody\u2019s been healthy,\u201d George said. \u201cWe\u2019re still learning each other. Our winning streak\u2019s going to come, sooner than later I believe.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Clippers host Detroit on Thursday at Staples Center.\n\nDoc Rivers was pleased with the @LAClippers shooting performance and is ready to get on with his NYE plans \ud83d\ude02#ClipperNation pic.twitter.com/ZAaIsFmhRO \u2014 FOX Sports West (@FoxSportsWest) January 1, 2020\n\nKawhi Leonard drops 24 PTS and 7 AST to lead the @LAClippers to the road win! #ClipperNation pic.twitter.com/YDcgke2jwJ \u2014 NBA (@NBA) January 1, 2020", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["los-angeles-clippers"], "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/long-beach-press-telegram-icon.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"application-name": "presstelegram", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "wp-parsely_version": "1.14", "fb": {"pages": 45134780748}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Paul George just misses triple-double as Clippers hammer Kings", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/paul-george-just-misses-triple-double-as-clippers-hammer-kings", "description": "George shakes off a slow start to finish with 21 points and season-highs of 11 rebounds and nine assists and Kawhi Leonard adds 24 points, as the short-handed Clippers roll to a 105-87 win.", "site_name": "Press Telegram", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Clippers-Kings-Baske-16x9-1-1.jpg?w=1024&h=579", "width": 1024, "height": 579}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T01:27:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T02:16:44+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Paul George just misses triple-double as Clippers hammer Kings"}, "image": "https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Clippers-Kings-Baske-16x9-1-1.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/long-beach-press-telegram-icon.png?w=37"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.ocregister.com/paul-george-just-misses-triple-double-as-clippers-hammer-kings"}
