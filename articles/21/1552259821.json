THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes\n\nOTTAWA - While Canada's response to the COVID-19 outbreak has taken off drastically in the last week, some have found it lopsided across the country.\n\nIn Ontario and Alberta, dine-in restaurants and bars are closed by provincial decree, while Quebec has shut down bars but ordered restaurants to limit the number of customers.\n\nOther provinces have made no such order.\n\nEven in a single city like Ottawa, there's variation between which businesses have stayed open and which have shuttered to the public.\n\nBusinesses need more federal direction to avoid confusion, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said Wednesday.\n\n\"One of the things businesses are looking for is more coherence,\" said Perrin Beatty, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.\n\nRight now in Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and federal health minister provide advice to the provinces, but each province and territory is ultimately responsible for making its own decisions.\n\nBeatty said the situation can be particularly vexing for companies that operate across jurisdictions.\n\n\"As rate of infection is growing, the same rules increasingly should apply across the board,\" he said.\n\nFor some, without specific advice from the federal government, it can be a difficult financial proposition to voluntarily shut their doors, he said.\n\nFederal authorities say that have been co-ordinating with provincial counterparts, but that local context is important.\n\n\"We very much recognize ... that there are specific conditions in specific cities, specific provinces,\" said Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.\n\n\"That's why we have public health officers also at the provincial and the city level.\"\n\nThe provinces' decisions about whether to close non-essential businesses comes down to the reality on the ground, including the number of cases of COVID-19 in the region and whether the area is seeing community transmission.\n\nChief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said it may also come down to a particular health system's ability to deal with an outbreak. A weaker health system may take a more cautious approach, for example, she said.\n\nBeatty suggested a national message might still be more helpful, even if it leaves room for exceptions. At least then the information would be coming from one source, he explained.\n\nHe did complement the federal government though on its open lines of communication with the business community.\n\nAnd to some extent, he said it will be up to businesses to do the right thing for their customers and employees.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March 18, 2020.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["news"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Laura Osman", "The Canadian Press"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "OTTAWA - While Canada's response to the COVID-19 outbreak has taken off drastically in the last week...", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "//media.brandonsun.com/designimages/favicon2.ico", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#0078a9", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "JcYgF8DLEZDKi0e_KDGmLS0UrVMdrF-zuytOqOh5nR4", "publish-date": "2020-03-18 16:12:38 CDT", "cXenseParse": {"taxonomy": "coronavirus", "recs": {"category": "coronavirus", "description": "OTTAWA - While Canada's response to the COVID-19 outbreak has taken off drastically in the last week, some have found it lopsided across the country. | In Ontario and Alberta, dine-in restaurants and bars are closed by provincial decree, while Quebec has shut down bars but ordered restaurants to limit the number of customers. | Other provinces have made no such order. | Even in a single city like Ottawa, there's variation between which businesses have stayed open and which have shuttered to the public.", "publishtime": "2020-03-18T20:37:10.000Z", "wfp-updatedtime": "2020-03-18T21:12:38.000Z", "wfp-titleshort": "Businesses want national message on closures", "articleid": 568904592, "image": "normal", "custom0": "cp-flag", "custom1": "/national/breaking-news", "custom2": "National Breaking News", "custom3": "Story|comments|0", "custom4": "WFP CP Article", "wordcount": 411, "wfp-urgency": 2, "wfp-imagecaption": "A sign notifying customers of a closed terrace is shown at food court in Montreal, Wednesday, March 18, 2020, as COVID-19 cases rise in Canada and around the world.
