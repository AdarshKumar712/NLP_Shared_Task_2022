Tiny Lilliarna Davis had been inspired to run the cake stall after seeing bushfires on the news and experiencing a pall of smoke covering her Toormina home in November. \"I'd discussed with her how some children have lost their homes and all their toys so she donated some of her own belongings to them,\" said her mother Belinda. \"Then she asked if she could do some cooking and sell the food so we went with it! My mum and dad (Darrell and Jill Davis) helped us with all the baking and we held the cake stall outside their house in Urunga.\" Advertised on social media as an RFS fundraiser, the cake stall was a roaring success. Belinda arranged to meet Senior Deputy Captain of Urunga Brigade Kale Hardie-Porter and Treasurer Craig Oates to hand over the takings. Kale and Craig accepted the money gratefully and explained that it would be passed on to the Mid North Coast RFS office to be banked towards the statewide RFS appeal. As a way of saying thanks, they also gave Lilliarna, her mum and her little brother the chance to sit inside a fire truck and have a good look around the station. Kale and his team from Urunga made world news in November when a cheeky note acknowledging that they'd 'borrowed' milk from the fridge of a house they'd saved became a viral sensation. Related: The little piece of paper that set the internet alight Belinda said Lilliarna is still keen to do more. \"She wants to do a stall every day. We will definitely do another one and continue to support the RFS.\"\n\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/janene.carey/9d4dd78a-4c51-4cf3-a81b-ac9212f6791d_rotated_270.jpg/r0_864_2250_2135_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Janene Carey"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan 15 16:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "She set up a cake stall outside her grandparents' place in Urunga", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//nnstatic-a.akamaihd.net/s/1579147507/sites/the-bellingen-shire-courier-sun/ico/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "title": "Tiny Lilliarna raises hundreds for RFS Bushfire Appeal", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "She set up a cake stall outside her grandparents' place in Urunga", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BellingenCourierSun", "published_time": "2020-01-15T16:00:00+11:00"}, "og": {"title": "Tiny Lilliarna raises hundreds for RFS Bushfire Appeal", "url": "https://www.bellingencourier.com.au/story/6582016/tiny-lilliarna-raises-hundreds-for-rfs-bushfire-appeal/", "site_name": "The Bellingen Shire Courier Sun", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/janene.carey/9d4dd78a-4c51-4cf3-a81b-ac9212f6791d_rotated_270.jpg/r0_864_2250_2135_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "secure_url": "https://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/janene.carey/9d4dd78a-4c51-4cf3-a81b-ac9212f6791d_rotated_270.jpg/r0_864_2250_2135_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 678, "width": 1200}, "description": "She set up a cake stall outside her grandparents' place in Urunga"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tiny Lilliarna raises hundreds for RFS Bushfire Appeal", "description": "She set up a cake stall outside her grandparents' place in Urunga", "image": "https://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/janene.carey/9d4dd78a-4c51-4cf3-a81b-ac9212f6791d_rotated_270.jpg/r0_864_2250_2135_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}, "news_keywords": "community, Urunga RFS, Bushfire Appeal", "author": "Janene Carey", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msvalidate.01": "F29B95B17E7034DD0832B3DBEF37C0F2", "fb": {"pages": 582671671784737}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.bellingencourier.com.au/story/6582016/tiny-lilliarna-raises-hundreds-for-rfs-bushfire-appeal/"}
