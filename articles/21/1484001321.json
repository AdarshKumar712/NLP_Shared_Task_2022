Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang got the opening goal in Arsenal\u2019s impressive first-half performance, but the defense gave up two late goals to absorb yet another defeat. The first goal came courtesy of Jorginho, who many thought should have been off for a second yellow, and the second goal was the result of a mistake from the much-maligned Shkodran Mustafi, who suffered a head-to-head collision just moments before. Yet the fact remains: Arsenal has now just one win in its last 12 Premier League matches. These are the dark times.\n\nManchester United (Last 5 Premier League matches: WDLWW) bounced up to fifth in the standings with a 2-0 win over Burnley. Anthony Martial, on a bit of a roll lately, scored the opener, with Marcus Rashford providing a late insurance goal in stoppage time. While it\u2019s still a bit more of a climb to break into the top four, United only finds itself four points behind an inconsistent Chelsea squad heading into the New Year.\n\nOdds\n\nThe William Hill oddsmakers call this one pretty even: Arsenal\u2019s at +170 odds (wager $100 to win $170), United\u2019s a slightly more favored foe at +150, and a draw is set for +260.\n\nUpcoming Fixtures\n\nArsenal, Monday, Jan. 6 vs. Leeds United (FA Cup); Saturday, Jan. 11 at Crystal Palace (Premier League)\n\nManchester United, Saturday, Jan. 4 at Wolves (FA Cup); Tuesday, Jan. 7 vs. Manchester United (League Cup)\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nThe Daily Dot may receive a payment in connection with purchases of products or services featured in this article.
