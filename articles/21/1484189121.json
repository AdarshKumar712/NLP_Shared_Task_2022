I cursed them out. I said \u2018F-U, Jews.\u201d\n\nAs she stood before a judge in Brooklyn Criminal Court with the hood to a navy blue jacket over her head, Harris was in familiar territory.\n\nShe still has an open harassment and assault case on the Brooklyn docket from November 2018.\n\nAnd last month, she was sentenced to no jail time for felony criminal mischief in Manhattan, court records show \u2014 a case for which she had repeatedly failed to make court appearances.\n\nBrooklyn prosecutors didn\u2019t even bother requesting bail Saturday, as they could have, given that the reform law, approved in April, technically doesn\u2019t take effect until Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cThe de Blasio administration has made it clear that we all need to get into compliance with bail reform now,\u201d said a law enforcement source.\n\n\u201cIf prosecutors had asked for bail, corrections would release them immediately,\u201d or they would be sprung on Jan. 1, the source said.\n\nBrooklyn Criminal Court Judge Laura Johnson even made mention of the coming bail reform legislation in ordering Harris freed.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m releasing her on consent and also because it will be required under the statute in just a few days,\u201d the judge said.\n\n\u201cMs. Harris you\u2019re being released on your own recognizance.\u201d\n\nShe was issued an order of protection barring contact with the three victims \u2014 and a court date of Jan. 10.\n\nHarris broke into a grin when approached by a reporter. \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d she said. \u201dGoodbye.\u201d\n\nThe legislation requires arraignment judges to set free suspects in any non-sexual assault that doesn\u2019t actually cause a physical injury, even in cases of hate crime attacks.\n\n\u201cIf there is an injury, then bail could be requested, because then it would be considered a violent felony,\u201d explained Insha Rahman, who, as director of strategy and new initiatives at the Vera Institute of Justice, worked closely with legislators and the governor\u2019s office in drafting the controversial reforms.\n\nThe no-injury loophole will mean a quick get-out-of-jail free card for all but one of the accused attackers in the eight Hanukkah-timed, anti-Semitic bias crimes that have terrified the city\u2019s Orthodox communities.\n\n\u201cYou have to beat the hell out of somebody \u2014 or murder them \u2014 for there to be any consequences,\u201d said former state lawmaker Dov Hikind, founder of Americans Against Anti-Semitism. \u201cOtherwise, you are set free.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s open season in New York \u2014 open season on innocent people. On Jews, on Muslims, on gay people. It applies to anybody. But it\u2019s the Jewish people in particular who have been targeted.\u201d\n\nOnly one of last week\u2019s eight attacks resulted in an actual physical injury \u2014 that of a 65-year-old Jewish man who was punched and kicked on Monday morning at East 41st Street and Third Avenue in Manhattan.\n\n\u201cF\u2013k you, Jew bastard!\u201d the petrified victim told cops his assailant shouted.\n\nThe suspect in that crime, Steven Jorge, 28, is indeed alleged to have injured his victim, and so was ordered locked up with no bail pending a psychological examination.\n\nJorge, though, is the exception.\n\nOn Friday night, a suspect in another of the hate attacks was similarly sprung with no bail, though in her case she was at least ordered to attend twice-monthly mental health appointments.\n\n\u201cYou f\u2014king Jew, the end is coming for you!\u201d that suspect, Ayana Logan, 43, allegedly shouted as she swung a handbag at a 34-year-old Orthodox mom in Gravesend.\n\nThe mother had been holding the hand of her 3-year-old son when the unprovoked attack happened, according to the criminal court complaint against Logan.\n\nBy Saturday night, Logan, Harris, and Jorge remained the only suspects apprehended in the hate spree. The assailants in the remaining five attacks remain at large.\n\nRahman and other reformers argue that the vast majority of suspects in minor assaults are quickly released anyway \u2014 and that the new bail reform lets judges set conditions for release that can address the underlying mental-health issues.\n\n\u201cThat can be mental health counseling, a stay-away order, which wasn\u2019t readily available before, as conditions for release,\u201d said Rahman.\n\nSuspects are getting none of that during their pretrial stays in city jails, Rahman noted.\n\n\u201cMoney bail, and keeping someone temporarily detained with no care, doesn\u2019t address at all the long term concerns\u201d of community safety and the well-being of suspects, she said.\n\nBut in the city\u2019s Orthodox neighborhoods, there was outrage in learning that even when violent bigots are caught, they\u2019ll be immediately released.\n\n\u201cThey were released on bail?\u201d a 32-year-old Orthodox man asked a Post reporter near where the three women were attacked. \u201cDisgusting.\u201d\n\nSteve Benjamin, 30, of Borough Park, said, \u201cWe\u2019re scared to walk at night in the street.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of hate here and I don\u2019t know why. People in the community are scared. It\u2019s very dangerous. It\u2019s just like remembering the days before World War II. I don\u2019t let my kids out alone.\n\n\u201cIt should be more justice \u2014 they arrest them, but they let them out of jail a day later.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Metro", "anti-semitism", "bail", "hate crimes", "new york city"], "tags": ["hate crimes", "bail", "anti-semitism", "new york city"], "authors": ["December"], "publish_date": "Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Suspects arrested in last week\u2019s spree of eight anti-Semitic attacks are being quickly released right back into the neighborhoods they terrorized thanks to \u201cbail reform\u201d legislation.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/nypost-2016/static/images/apple-icons/nypost/apple-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2019 NYP Holdings.
