Although they initially only shared it with friends, the pair say they\u2019ve enjoyed seeing passersby also discover the temporary parasitic structure, and share it with others.\n\n\u2018Somehow this intervention intends to enforce for the inalienable right that we have as citizens to change and reinvent the city according to our most intimate desires and convictions,\u2019 says the duo.\n\nThe micro-refuge follows in the footsteps of designer Fernando Abellanas, who installed a secret \u2018\u2018parasitic\u2019 studio beneath a bridge in Valencia.\n\nParasitic architecture refers to architectural interventions that are attached to larger, existing structures. They are socially provocative and respond to issues identified in the city fabric.\n\nWorking on your own parasitic project?
