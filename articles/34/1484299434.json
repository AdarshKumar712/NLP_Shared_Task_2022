This type of coverage is commonly called a \u201cgroup health insurance plan\u201d or \u201cemployer-sponsored health insurance.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the average cost of insurance per employee for family coverage was $18,764 with workers on average paying $5,714 towards the cost of their coverage. In 2018 that number rose to $19,616, a 5% increase. In 2018, workers paid 18% of the cost for single employee and 29% for family coverage (source). Although numbers vary by company and provider, the average costs continue to rise.\n\nHow Much Does Insurance Cost for Employers?\n\n$13,927 annually (71 percent of the premium) to cover a family\n\nHow Much Does Insurance Cost for Employees?\n\n$ 5,689 annually (29% of the premium) to cover a family\n\nEmployee costs are typically taken through a payroll deduction.\n\nRelated: How Much Does Group Health Insurance Cost?\n\nAdditionally, premium costs with a group health insurance plan may change annually. In fact over 90 percent of employers are seeing rate increases at renewal time, with about a quarter seeing double-digit premium increases.\n\nTo minimize or reduce fluctuation in premium amounts, and to control the cost of benefits from year to year, one option is to change contribution strategies.\n\nControlling Costs with a Reimbursement Strategy\n\nInstead of purchasing a group health insurance policy and paying premiums set by the insurance company, an alternative strategy is to define a contribution amount toward employees\u2019 health insurance. With this type of reimbursement plan, the business:\n\nSets any contribution amount to employees\u2019 health insurance costs\n\nAllows employees to purchase a health insurance plan (either through a private exchange or the health insurance Marketplaces)\n\nReimburses employees for their premiums, up to their available balance amount\n\nThe cost of health benefits with a reimbursement strategy? Any amount the business can afford.\n\nThat being said, many businesses look at the cost of the individual health insurance policies the employees will be purchasing to help set the contribution amounts. In 2016, the cost of individual health insurance for a 40 year old on a Silver plan averaged $351.02 per month or $4,212.24 a year.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn average, the combined cost of providing group health insurance is $6,251 per year for single coverage (2015) or $17,545 per year for family coverage.\n\nTo offer more affordable health benefits, one solution is to adopt a defined contribution strategy where employees purchase individual health insurance and are reimbursed by their defined contribution allowance.\n\nIn a time of steep annual rate increases for group health insurance, a defined contribution model offers cost predictability and access to quality health insurance coverage.\n\nDo you have questions about how much it costs to provide health insurance to your small business employees?
