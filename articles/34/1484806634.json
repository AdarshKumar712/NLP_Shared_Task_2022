The cost of managing such diseases are also high. Treating end-stage renal disease with dialysis or transplant often leads to catastrophic spending, which robs wage earners of the ability to provide for their families.\n\n\u201cAbandoning the patients and their families will not produce the gains in their health status. Hence, there is a need for joint intervention to reduce the menace of this killer disease,\u201d Awobusuyi said.\n\nThe nephrologist urged stakeholders in the health sector to develop strategic approaches that would generate funds for the care of patients with kidney disease.\n\nThe Coordinator of the foundation, Mr Obetta Remigius, noted that kidney diseases had become a serious problem to humanity. Global records, he stressed, show that one in every 10 persons has one form of kidney disease or another.\n\nRemigius also said the socio-economicic consequences of kidney-related diseases are unimaginable. Calling for drastic and collaborative actions to curtail the disease, he said, \u201cSubstantial action should be taken by each state to reduce poverty, increase equity, improve nutrition, advance education, and develop health services and human resources. It is of the essence to know that this project is all about humanity, which we are part of. sequel to this, I humbly request that we make whatever contributions we can towards this campaign to save lives.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll rights reserved.
