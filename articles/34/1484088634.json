Those strikes were in response to a rocket attack on an Iraqi Army base that killed a U.S. contractor and injured several American troops.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, the protesters had set up around 50 tents, along with a makeshift clinic. Cooks with aprons were serving meals out of giant pots.\n\nOutside one of the gates, a Shiite cleric recited verses from the Muslim holy book, the Koran, through a loudspeaker.\n\nElsewhere, demonstrators could be seen hurling rocks over the walls of the embassy compound before U.S. troops responded by firing tear gas from the roofs of the buildings.\n\nSome 100 U.S. Marines arrived at the embassy late Tuesday to bolster security as President Trump has denounced the actions by protesters, vowing the situation in Baghdad \u201cwill not be a Benghazi.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 09:29:53 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://therightscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "US troops fire tear gas and rubber bullets to repel second day of protesters at US Embassy in Iraq", "description": "Iraqi militiamen were back at it again today outside the US Embassy in Iraq, but this time they were met with tear gas and rubber bullets from a new contingent of 100", "url": "https://therightscoop.com/us-troops-fire-tear-gas-and-rubber-bullets-to-repel-second-day-of-protesters-at-us-embassy-in-iraq/", "site_name": "The Right Scoop", "image": {"identifier": "https://therightscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/usembassy_baghdad.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 387}}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2020-01-01T09:29:53-05:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@TheRightScoop", "url": "https://therightscoop.com/us-troops-fire-tear-gas-and-rubber-bullets-to-repel-second-day-of-protesters-at-us-embassy-in-iraq/", "title": "US troops fire tear gas and rubber bullets to repel second day of protesters at US Embassy in Iraq", "description": "Iraqi militiamen were back at it again today outside the US Embassy in Iraq, but this time they were met with tear gas and rubber bullets from a new contingent of 100\u2026", "image": "https://therightscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/usembassy_baghdad.jpg", "partner": "tfwp"}}, "canonical_link": "https://therightscoop.com/us-troops-fire-tear-gas-and-rubber-bullets-to-repel-second-day-of-protesters-at-us-embassy-in-iraq/"}
