The Daily Beast first reported the rulings on Monday.\n\nRight-wing media personality Alex Jones has been ordered to pay $100,000 in a case brought by a man whose son was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting. Jones is facing several lawsuits for his claim that the 2012 massacre was a hoax pic.twitter.com/8aA4xQtwha \u2014 Reuters (@Reuters) December 31, 2019\n\nThe judge\u2019s filings ordered Jones to pay more than $100,000 for failing to provide discovery, or evidence owed to the opposing side, and for filing a frivolous request to dismiss the case. In October, the same judge ordered Jones to pay another $25,875 for failing to respond to a previous discovery order.\n\nJones\u2019 attorney, Wade Jefferies, said the lawsuit should be dismissed on freedom of speech grounds and said he would appeal the judge\u2019s decision not to dismiss it. He also said the legal payments ordered by the judge were excessive.\n\n\u201cAs to the actual amounts of attorney\u2019s fees awarded, in my opinion, and every lawyer with knowledge of the case I have talked to agrees, the attorney\u2019s fee awards are excessive,\u201d Jefferies said in an email.\n\nThe Sandy Hook tragedy rocked the United States when a 20-year-old man shot and killed his mother at home and then went on a rampage at the school, also killing himself.\n\nJones began promoting the fiction that the event was staged. After conducting what he called \u201cdeep research,\u201d Jones said in 2014 \u201cthe whole thing was fake.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a deposition linked to one of the suits, Jones later conceded that \u201cchildren died and it\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d while also denying he had wronged the parents of the slain children.\n\nMark Bankston, an attorney representing Heslin and three other Sandy Hook parents, said Jones has \u201cput a middle finger up to the court.\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully these orders will have the effect of telling him there\u2019s severe consequences for this,\u201d Bankston said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["lawsuit", "alex jones", "Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting", "infowars"], "tags": ["What's Working: Purpose + Profit", "SHOPPING", "Impact: This New World", "Lawsuit", "InfoWars", "Finds", "Sandy Hook", "HuffPost Press Room", "Congress", "Podcasts", "Impact: Project Zero", "2020 Election", "Extremism", "Alex Jones", "Donald Trump", "Social Justice"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 03:17:21 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The right-wing media personality, who claimed the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax, was sued by the parent of a young boy slain in the attack.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/favicon-2020e123c064086aad150fe909c53771f862d7c76cd62f6146e81d533845fd7d.ico", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "The right-wing media personality, who claimed the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax, was sued by the parent of a young boy slain in the attack.", "keywords": "lawsuit,alex jones,Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting,infowars", "og": {"title": "Judge Orders Infowars Founder Alex Jones To Pay $100,000 In Sandy Hook Lawsuit", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e0c534c24000053245a4aca.jpeg?cache=ll0bo6p636&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e0c534c24000053245a4aca.jpeg?cache=ll0bo6p636&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alex-jones-infowars-sandy-hook-lawsuit_n_5e0c5105e4b0b2520d1c080a", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The right-wing media personality, who claimed the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax, was sued by the parent of a young boy slain in the attack."}, "article": {"tag": "lawsuit,alex jones,Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting,infowars", "section": "U.S. News", "published_time": "2020-01-01 03:17:21 -0500", "modified_time": "2020-01-01 03:17:21 -0500"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPost", "title": "Judge Orders Infowars Founder Alex Jones To Pay $100,000 In Sandy Hook Lawsuit", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e0c534c24000053245a4aca.jpeg?cache=ll0bo6p636&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "The right-wing media personality, who claimed the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax, was sued by the parent of a young boy slain in the attack."}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5e0c5105e4b0b2520d1c080a", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "us-news"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alex-jones-infowars-sandy-hook-lawsuit_n_5e0c5105e4b0b2520d1c080a"}
