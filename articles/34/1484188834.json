While families and friends grieve the loss of their loved one, we must as a society all respond with deeds to prevent it happening to others,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister called on ordinary road users to take \u201cgreater responsibility for our actions when using the road\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe can do this by slowing down, not driving while impaired through drink, drugs or fatigue, by not driving while using a phone, by wearing a seatbelt and always sharing the road more carefully with pedestrians and cyclists,\u201d he added.\n\nLiz O\u2019Donnell, chairwoman of the RSA, said it is \u201cdeeply saddening\u201d that road deaths had risen in 2019.\n\n\u2018Renewed effort\u2019\n\n\u201cWe must respond to this increase the same way we have responded to previous setbacks. Rather than being disheartened, it should spur us and our road safety partners into renewed effort,\u201d she said.\n\nGarda Assistant Commissioner Dave Sheahan said road policing will remain a \u201cstrategic priority\u201d for garda\u00ed this year, and two \u201csignificant developments\u201d will happen to ensure road safety enforcement is achieved.\n\n\u201cFirstly, an additional 180 garda\u00ed have been selected to be assigned to roads policing duties in early 2020. Secondly, the rollout of the new mobility app will be stepped up so that by the end of 2020 there will be in excess of 4,000 devices in the hands of front-line garda\u00ed,\u201d Mr Sheahan said.\n\n\u201cThe new mobility app will revolutionise the way roads policing is carried out in this country.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Minister calls on road users to take \u2018greater responsibility for actions when using roads\u2019", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/assets/images/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "Minister calls on road users to take \u2018greater responsibility for actions when using roads\u2019", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14128126"}, "news_keywords": "News, Dave Sheehan, Liz O Donnell, Shane Ross, Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, Road Safety Authority", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "Almost 150 people killed on State\u2019s roads during 2019", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/almost-150-people-killed-on-state-s-roads-during-2019-1.4128126", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "Minister calls on road users to take \u2018greater responsibility for actions when using roads\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128124.1577821018!/image/image.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128124.1577821018!/image/image.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 254, "width": 453}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimes", "creator": "@shaunabowerss", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/almost-150-people-killed-on-state-s-roads-during-2019-1.4128126", "title": "Almost 150 people killed on State\u2019s roads during 2019", "description": "Minister calls on road users to take \u2018greater responsibility for actions when using roads\u2019", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128124.1577821018!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/almost-150-people-killed-on-state-s-roads-during-2019-1.4128126"}
