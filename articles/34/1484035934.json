The former mayor also floated the idea that he may \u201cdo demonstrations\u201d and would also \u201clove to try the case.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether or not Giuliani is suggesting that he would organize protests during the Senate trial; and, his enthusiasm notwithstanding, Giuliani won\u2019t be serving on Trump\u2019s legal defense despite being his personal lawyer.\n\nTo give Giuliani the benefit of the doubt, it is likely his remarks about being willing to testify were given to demonstrate his conviction that Trump is innocent of the charges made against him. Still, good intentions aside, he may have done more harm than good \u2013 Giuliani may have accidentally undermined Senate Republicans in no small way and pushed them into an increasingly difficult position.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has repeatedly affirmed his intent to forbid witness testimony during the impeachment trial, citing a desire for a speedy conclusion. While, unsurprisingly, Democrats have protested this move vigorously, virtually all Senate Republicans, with two notable exceptions, appear to agree with McConnell on having no witnesses.\n\nNow, with Giuliani volunteering to appear as a witness, he has added unwelcome pressure to McConnell and other Republicans. After all, it would look rather odd for Republicans to block testimony from someone within Trump\u2019s own camp, especially someone who has proven himself very loyal to the president.\n\nNo doubt Democrats would be more than open to having Giuliani testify, given his central role in the Ukraine scandal. By several accounts, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer played a key role in pushing for legally questionable agreements between the White House and the Ukrainian government, including an investigation of Hunter Biden \u2013 but that\u2019s assuming both that Giuliani won\u2019t walk these statements back first and that Republicans will permit trial witnesses.\n\nPhoto: AFP / SAUL LOEB", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["rudy giuliani", "donald trump", "ukraine", "impeachment", ""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 10:31:46 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Giuliani's remarks could serve to undermine Republicans opposed to testimonies.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "rudy giuliani, donald trump, ukraine, impeachment,", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/giuliani-says-hed-be-fine-testifying-during-trump-impeachment-trial-2894942", "title": "Giuliani Says He'd Be Fine With Testifying During Trump Impeachment Trial", "description": "Giuliani's remarks could serve to undermine Republicans opposed to testimonies.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2019/10/16/trumps-personal-lawyer-rudy-giuliani-has-brushed-off.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2019/10/16/trumps-personal-lawyer-rudy-giuliani-has-brushed-off.jpg", "height": 682, "width": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "National", "author": "Llowell Williams", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T10:31:46-05:00", "published_time": "2020-01-01T10:31:46-05:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Giuliani Says He'd Be Fine With Testifying During Trump Impeachment Trial", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/giuliani-says-hed-be-fine-testifying-during-trump-impeachment-trial-2894942", "description": "Giuliani's remarks could serve to undermine Republicans opposed to testimonies.", "image": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2019/10/16/trumps-personal-lawyer-rudy-giuliani-has-brushed-off.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-config": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#000000", "keywords": "rudy giuliani, donald trump, ukraine, impeachment,", "author": "Llowell Williams", "description": "Giuliani's remarks could serve to undermine Republicans opposed to testimonies."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.com/giuliani-says-hed-be-fine-testifying-during-trump-impeachment-trial-2894942"}
