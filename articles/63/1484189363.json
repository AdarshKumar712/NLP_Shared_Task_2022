However, Dreamliner fans are set to be spoiled for a few weeks in September when American Airlines will be deploying a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner on the route instead.\n\nAccording to Routesonline, the aircraft will be taking off from the 9th of September to the 26th of September on the following frequency:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlight Number: AA220\n\nDeparting Dallas/Fort Worth at 1545 PM and arriving at Amsterdam the next day at 0815 AM. Daily service.\n\nAdvertisement Featured Video:\n\nFlight Number: AA221\n\nDeparting Amsterdam at 1020 AM and arriving at Dallas/Fort Worth the same day at 1345 PM. Daily service.\n\nHow does the Boeing 787-9 compare to the Boeing 777-200ER?\n\nIs the Boeing 787-9 an upgrade from the Boeing 777-200?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican Airlines configures their Boeing 777-200ER with 273 seats in three cabins (although economy is split into \u2018main cabin\u2019 and \u2018main cabin extra\u2019 \u2013 we will get to that in a minute). The Boeing 787-9 seats 285 passengers in the same number of cabins, but has the added advantage of bigger windows, better pressurization, and quieter engines.\n\nOn the Boeing 777, business class has 37 seats that transform into lie-flat beds with 60 inches of pitch and are 21 inches wide. This is compared to the Dreamliners 30 lie-flat seats, which extend to a further 77 inches in bed mode. Both cabins are in a 1-2-1 configuration but beware, not every business class seat on the 787 has a window.\n\nBoth aircraft have the new American Airlines premium economy seats. These are in a 2-4-2 configuration onboard the 777-200ER, and in a 2-3-2 configuration onboard the 787. This lets couples sit together on the sides and families all in one in the middle. They have 38 inches of legroom and recline more than economy seats.\n\nLastly, both aircraft have plenty of economy seats onboard. But they are not equal at all. The Boeing 777-200ER has the seats laid out in a 3-4-3 configuration with 31 inches of pitch, whilst the Boeing 787 has them in a 3-3-3 configuration with 32 inches of pitch. But this dichotomy is reversed when looking at the \u2018main cabin extra\u2019. The Boeing 777-200ER has 37 inches of legroom (one inch less than premium economy!) compared to 35 onboard the 787.\n\nBottom line, both aircraft have very simular cabin products, but the additional benefits of the Dreamliner plus its much friendlier economy cabin place it above the 777-200ER in my books.\n\nThe schedule information in this article was originally published by Routesonline\n\nWhat do you think?
