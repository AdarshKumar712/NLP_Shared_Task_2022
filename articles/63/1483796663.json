The new CDS was addressing the media after inspecting a tri-services guard of honour, where the three service chiefs were also present.General Rawat said as the CDS, he would strive for ensuring \u201cjointness\u201d and synergy among the three services within the three-year timeline set by the government. He would also work towards a mechanism that suits Indian requirements for theatre commands, an idea that the air force had earlier opposed. \u201cI think there are methods of doing theaterisation. I think we are copying western methods and what others have done. We can have our own systems and will work out our mechanisms through an understanding with each other. I think it can work,\u201d he said.A theatre command is a military structure wherein all the assets of the army, air force and navy in a particular theatre of war are under the operational control of a three-star general. It is designed to achieve better military results. The Andaman and Nicobar Command is India\u2019s first theatre command, established in 2001.One of the mandates of the CDS is to ensure restructuring of military commands for the best utilisation of resources by bringing in jointness in operations, including through establishing theatre commands.He said: \u201cThe CDS\u2019 task is to have jointness and synergy between the three services \u2026 In this, the army, navy and air force will work as a team. CDS will ensure coordination and control over them, but it will be teamwork.\u201dGeneral Rawat said there would be a need to focus on the best economical use of the resources of the three services, joint training and bringing uniformity in the procurement procedure.On a lighter note, when asked how he felt as the CDS, he said: \u201cMy head is feeling lighter. I have had to take off the angled Gurkha hat, which I had been wearing for 41 years. I have come back to the peak, because the peak cap which I am wearing is to say that the CDS will remain neutral. He will be neutral to all the three services, including his own service.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Manoj Mukund Naravane", "Indian Army", "india chief of defence staff", "Bipin singh rawat", "CDS India", "Indian army chief", "Pakistan Navy"], "tags": ["Manoj Mukund Naravane", "Indian army chief", "Pakistan Navy", "india chief of defence staff", "Bipin singh rawat", "CDS India"], "authors": ["Shaurya Karanbir Gurung"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Bipin Rawat said the Indian armed forces had always stayed away from politics and worked according to the governments directives, amid allegations that the military was being politicised.
