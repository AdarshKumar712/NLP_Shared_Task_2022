The facility, which will house up to 1,000 patients, will be set up in the Berlin Messe trade fair exhibition grounds in the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district of the German capital. The hospital will be built with the help of the German armed forces, the Bundeswehr. \u2014 DW\n\nAs the coronavirus outbreak rapidly expands also in Germany, officials in Berlin hope to prevent potential bottlenecks in the capital's hospital system with a new medical facility specifically for COVID-19 patients. The country now has more than 10,000 confirmed cases \u2014 the third highest in Europe after Italy and Spain.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, the impromptu construction efforts in Wuhan, China made headlines when two emergency specialty field hospitals with a combined capacity of 2,300 beds were erected in a matter of only days. The round-the-clock endeavor was streamed live by Chinese state media and attracted a huge audience of citizens that had been ordered not to go outside for several weeks.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["economy", "buildings", "employment", "archinect pinterest", "coronavirus outbreak", "jobs", "housing", "aia", "competitions", "covid-19", "healthcare", "competition", "los angeles", "get lectured", "technology", "employer of the day", "tower", "california", "installation", "preservation", "germany", "school lectures", "construction", "emergency", "real estate", "uk", "hospital", "skyscraper", "chicago", "event", "sustainability", "berlin", "new york city", "coronavirus", "museum", "frank gehry", "climate change", "historic preservation", "urban planning", "archinect sessions", "job search", "sponsored", "san francisco", "new york", "editor's picks", "exhibition", "affordable housing", "award", "eotd", "active employers", "transportation", "events", "china", "pinterest", "academia", "london", "art"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "As the coronavirus outbreak rapidly expands also in Germany, officials in Berlin hope to prevent potential bottlenecks in the capital's hospital system with a new medical facility specifically for COVID-19 patients.
