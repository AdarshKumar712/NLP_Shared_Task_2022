England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty is self-isolating after experiencing COVID-19 symptoms as well.\n\nFor most people this coronavirus causes mild to moderate illness but some people, especially those who are elderly or who have underlying conditions, can develop more severe disease and require hospitalisation.\n\nMore than 47,000 people in the UK have tested positive for COVID-19 and nearly 5,000 people have died.\n\nIn a rare address to the British public on Sunday, the Queen recognised the challenge of the unfolding coronavirus pandemic and urged people to stay strong.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["news", "Coronavirus", "COVID-19"], "tags": ["Health", "super moon", "European Union", "news", "COVID-19", "United Kingdom", "Coronavirus", "Boris Johnson", "lockdown"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sun Apr  5 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The UK prime minister tweets from hospital to say he is \"in good spirits\" while undergoing \"routine\" tests after 11 days with coronavirus symptoms.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"minutely-publisher": "MIN-20200", "description": "The UK prime minister tweets from hospital to say he is \"in good spirits\" while undergoing \"routine\" tests after 11 days with coronavirus symptoms.", "keywords": "news,Coronavirus,COVID-19", "date.created": "2020-04-05 22:23:37", "date.available": "2020-04-05 22:23:37", "date.updated": "2020-04-06 18:36:22", "date.modified": "2020-04-06 18:36:22", "article": {"theme": "europe", "published_time": "2020-04-05 22:23:37", "modified_time": "2020-04-06 18:36:22", "section": "european-affairs_europe", "author": "Lauren Chadwick"}, "program.url": "web-digital-stories", "robots": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:standard", "news_keywords": "news,Coronavirus,COVID-19", "og": {"locale": {"identifier": "en-GB", "alternate": "en-GB"}, "site_name": "euronews", "url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/04/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-for-tests-as-precautionary-step-due-to-coronavirus-symp", "type": "article", "title": "UK coronavirus death toll surpasses 5,000 as PM remains in hospital", "description": "The UK prime minister tweets from hospital to say he is \"in good spirits\" while undergoing \"routine\" tests after 11 days with coronavirus symptoms.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/61/34/12/1000x563_cmsv2_feffa248-2dc1-5e83-b55c-27411c5fd623-4613412.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "type": "image/jpeg", "alt": "UK coronavirus death toll surpasses 5,000 as PM remains in hospital"}}, "twitter": {"site": "@euronews", "title": "UK coronavirus death toll surpasses 5,000 as PM remains in hospital", "description": "The UK prime minister tweets from hospital to say he is \"in good spirits\" while undergoing \"routine\" tests after 11 days with coronavirus symptoms.", "image": {"alt": "UK coronavirus death toll surpasses 5,000 as PM remains in hospital"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "images0": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/61/34/12/1000x563_cmsv2_feffa248-2dc1-5e83-b55c-27411c5fd623-4613412.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 101402598109}, "sponsored": "no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#003865", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Euronews.com", "application-name": "Euronews.com", "msapplication-config": "browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-tooltip": "Euronews.com", "msapplication-window": "width=1280;height=1024", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#003865", "msapplication-starturl": "./", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/mstile-small.jpg", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/mstile-medium.jpg", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/mstile-wide.jpg", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/mstile-large.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1", "mobile-web-app-capable": "no"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/04/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-for-tests-as-precautionary-step-due-to-coronavirus-symp"}
