However, the Guardian checked with the Cabinet Office, which is overseeing restrictions on movement, and a spokeswoman confirmed that the guidelines did not prohibit driving somewhere for exercise or dog walking.\n\nDerbyshire police tweeted: \u201cDespite posts yesterday highlighting issues of people still visiting the #PeakDistrict despite government guidance, the message is still not getting through. @DerPolDroneUnit have been out at beauty spots across the county, and this footage was captured at #CurbarEdge last night.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cSome number plates were coming back to keepers in #Sheffield, so we know that people are travelling to visit these areas. Daily exercise should be taken locally to your home. Under government guidance all travel is limited to essential travel only. Travelling to remote areas of the #PeakDistrict for your exercise is not essential travel. PLEASE, #StayHomeSaveLives.\u201d\n\nQuick guide UK lockdown: what are the coronavirus restrictions? Show Hide What do the restrictions involve? People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes: Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible\n\nOne form of exercise a day \u2013 for example a run, walk, or cycle \u2013 alone or with members of your household\n\nAny medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person\n\nTravelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will: Close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship\n\nStop all gatherings of more than two people in public \u2013 excluding people you live with\n\nStop all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.\n\nA spokesman for Derbyshire police insisted there was nothing sinister about the drone deployment. \u201cIt\u2019s not Big Brother. It\u2019s just to illustrate the fact that people are going out and making these journeys against the government\u2019s rules. The rules are clear that people should avoid all non-essential travel and exercise and walk their dogs near their homes. If they drive into the Peaks and have a collision or breakdown or go for a walk and fall over, we\u2019re the ones who will be called, or mountain rescue,\u201d he said.\n\nThe drone operator was not hidden, he added. \u201cThe pilot was standing next to a liveried police vehicle close to the car park while people were coming in and out.\u201d\n\nCivil liberties groups criticised the sweeping powers given to police on Thursday, including the power to force people to go home, as \u201cauthoritarian\u201d and \u201cchilling\u201d. Police vowed to use them if they had to do so.\n\nPlay Video 4:04 Coronavirus lockdown in the UK: the dos and don'ts \u2013 video explainer\n\nFines will start at \u00a330, offenders can also be arrested, and police say they will try to persuade people to obey a lockdown that few expect will end in three weeks time.\n\nClare Collier, the advocacy director at Liberty, said: \u201cWe\u2019re extremely concerned by the extent of these coercive powers. This is a pandemic and so it should be treated as a public health issue. Instead the government is treating it as a criminal justice issue, putting resources into detaining and criminalising.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s concerning is what this heavy-handed approach will do to the public\u2019s relationship with the police in the long-term. And while some people will feel reassured by a firmer police response to the pandemic, others will feel fear, especially groups who are already over-policed.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 3:09 Squats, drones and angry mayors: policing coronavirus lockdowns around the world \u2013 video report\n\nSilkie Carlo, the director of Big Brother Watch, said: \u201cThese are chilling powers that create a serious risk of arbitrary policing. Authorities are right to take robust measures to protect public health, but in truth the only way we can control the spread is through well-informed community cooperation, not just criminalisation. Basic safeguards are missing from these extraordinary powers and I\u2019m afraid more draconian powers still are to come from the Coronavirus Act.\u201d\n\nMartin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, who was involved in negotiations with the government about the powers, said: \u201cI am confident the overwhelming majority of people already understand the gravity of the situation we face. There will be a small number who do not and we will engage with them, explain to them and encourage them to go home. If they refuse to do the right thing, we are fully prepared to use these new powers.\u201d\n\nUnder measures announced on Monday by Boris Johnson, members of the public are allowed out of their homes for one form of exercise a day, for example a run, walk or cycle, alone or with members of their household.\n\nThe government guidance does not specify how long this exercise can last or how far a distance it can cover. It does not specifically ban driving somewhere to walk a pet or exercise, but makes clear that all non-essential travel should be avoided.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police move on a group of three people from Cardiff Castle on 26 March.

The move was being introduced to ensure motorists are complying with government restrictions, North Yorkshire police said.\n\n\u201cOfficers will be stopping vehicles and asking motorists where they are going, why they are going there, and reminding them of the message to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives,\u201d the force said in a statement. The checkpoints will be unannounced and could be anywhere across the county.\n\nThe assistant chief constable Mike Walker said: \u201cThe new and significant restrictions \u2026 spell out very clearly what each and every one of us must do to save lives. The message is clear and the warning stark: stay at home, save lives.\n\n\u201cThese are the lives of the people we know and love. Our partners, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, children, grandparents. You may never be in such a position again where your simple actions will lead directly to saving lives.\u201d\n\nPolice in west and mid-Wales have begun stopping drivers to check that their journeys are essential, and are also patrolling public spaces and tourist hotspots.\n\n\n\nAndy Williams, a Dyfed-Powys roads policing inspector, said: \u201cMore people on the roads means a greater likelihood of vehicles breaking down or being involved in an accident, which puts extra strain on the emergency services. These extra interactions also increase the chances of the virus spreading and putting more people\u2019s lives in danger.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday North Wales police sent a family of five home after they were caught travelling from Merseyside to Llanfairfechan for a day at the seaside. In a Facebook post, the force\u2019s Conwy coastal unit said: \u201cOfficers are out patrolling and it is pleasing to see that most people are sticking to the government advice.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Police", "North of England", "Yorkshire", "Wales", "Coronavirus outbreak", "UK news"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Helen Pidd", "Vikram Dodd"], "publish_date": "Thu Mar 26 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "New law empowers police to use force to send people home as confusion continues over safety guidelines", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/fee5e2d638d1c35f6d501fa397e53329/152x152.png", "meta_data": {"description": "New law empowers police to use force to send people home as confusion continues over safety guidelines", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Vikram Dodd", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056ac7da0e385ac328344eb6a2c8cbf38b567d8f/175_106_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0ffbee316911b256a53a277437488344", "keywords": "Police,North of England,Yorkshire,Wales,Coronavirus outbreak,UK news", "news_keywords": "Police,North of England,Yorkshire,Wales,Coronavirus outbreak,UK news", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/uk-police-use-drones-and-roadblocks-to-enforce-lockdown", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056ac7da0e385ac328344eb6a2c8cbf38b567d8f/175_106_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1b2223bfa160e9d3f52d0b065bcba912", "description": "New law empowers police to use force to send people home as confusion continues over safety guidelines", "type": "article", "title": "UK police use drones and roadblocks to enforce lockdown", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helenpidd,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/vikramdodd", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "UK news", "published_time": "2020-03-26T16:54:49.000Z", "tag": "Police,North of England,Yorkshire,Wales,Coronavirus outbreak,UK news", "modified_time": "2020-03-26T19:19:52.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2020/mar/26/uk-police-use-drones-and-roadblocks-to-enforce-lockdown?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2020/mar/26/uk-police-use-drones-and-roadblocks-to-enforce-lockdown?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/uk-police-use-drones-and-roadblocks-to-enforce-lockdown", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2020/mar/26/uk-police-use-drones-and-roadblocks-to-enforce-lockdown?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056ac7da0e385ac328344eb6a2c8cbf38b567d8f/175_106_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d5e1f0678d6f3040cfb61c1dc03fc177", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/uk-police-use-drones-and-roadblocks-to-enforce-lockdown"}
