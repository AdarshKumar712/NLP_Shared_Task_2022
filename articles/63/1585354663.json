Meanwhile, I advise everyone out there to take precautionary measures.\n\nThe federal and state governments have strongly recommended that Germans wear face masks when shopping and on public transport, and some states have even made that compulsory. I totally support this move. We have to jointly conquer the COVID-19 battle,\u201d he stated.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nRichard Phillz who is currently self employed, running a business which deals in trading forex, binary and coaching, sheds more light on his plans and inspiration.\n\nHe said, \u201cI teach clients how to handle personal trading charts and I has over one million clients worldwide who are currently learning from different trading tricks from me.\n\nI plan to take the cryptoworld to the next level before the end of 2020. I am actually working on something but I don\u2019t want to unveil it for now\n\nMy mentor in the game has always been Grant Cordone. He has learnt lot of business strategies by reading his books and they are quite inspiring.\n\nIn addition, I work with the best team and well trained traders. I am always very careful while making recruitments. So, my busy schedule does not affect my business in any way.\n\nI also need to state this, I rate my country of business; USA to be 100% because it is a good place to actualize dreams and help people achieve their dreams too.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the challenges of running such kind of business, Richard Phillz notes that he had a hard time starting up trade, as he had to live from proceeds he got from selling drugs, \u201cnot until I went online to try to learn new business ideas on YouTube. I saved up capital to begin a trade, at first, I made lot of losses but it was all worth it at the end. I made a decision that I wanted to start talking responsibility for my life and do something great with it, so I got off drugs, cleaned up my act, and committed to achieving at astronomical levels.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWhatever challenges you have gone through or are currently going through, I want to encourage you to make a decision to take personal responsibility for them and decide, right now, that you want a better life and are willing to do everything you can to turn it around.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy. Never before have the challenges and risks in life loomed so large; but never before have the potential payoffs been so huge. That\u2019s why they\u2019re called challenges. But that hard work, perseverance, and commitment will lead to great things once you\u2019re on the other side of them. One thing I realized is that if you weren\u2019t up for the challenge, you wouldn\u2019t have it. Each challenge you have is uniquely yours and because of that, you can get past it.\u201d\n\nRichard Phillz was born into the family of Mr and Mrs Aterus Phiip. He was the only child of his parents and grew up as good kid. He was not born into a wealthy background but his parents did all they could to make sure their only child becomes successful in life. Richard had his basic education in the public schools in Germany and his high school was in Ramstein high school, Germany.\n\nHe was one of the most intelligent kids in school and he was fortunate to obtain a scholarship to college. He had his college education at the imperial college in London. After college education, he relocated to the United States of America where he was able to further his education and bagged an Associate degree in the Harvard Business School.\n\nVanguard\n\nKindly Share This Story:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["View All Posts Nwafor"], "publish_date": "Wed Apr 22 03:02:25 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The CEO of 24 String Option, Richard Don Philip, better known as Richard Phillz has urged his fellow Germans to heed to COVID-19 precautionary measures in the country as the one month of lockdown elapses.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/favicon.png?fit=16%2C16&ssl=1", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1300", "fb": {"pages": 125111084176530, "app_id": 1281965775160257}, "OBKey": "KoeDKhtk63NPK0HQB1Wydg==", "description": "The CEO of 24 String Option, Richard Don Philip, better known as Richard Phillz has urged his fellow Germans to heed to COVID-19 precautionary measures in the country as the one month of lockdown elapses.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID-19: Richard Phillz urges Germans to heed to precautionary", "description": "The CEO of 24 String Option, Richard Don Philip, better known as Richard Phillz has urged his fellow Germans to heed to COVID-19 precautionary measures in the country as the one month of lockdown elapses.", "url": "https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/04/covid-19-richard-phillz-urges-germans-to-heed-to-precautionary-measures/", "site_name": "Vanguard News", "updated_time": "2020-04-22T19:55:02+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/richel.jpg?fit=600%2C590&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/richel.jpg?fit=600%2C590&ssl=1", "width": 600, "height": 590}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/vanguardngr", "tag": "Richard Phillz", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-04-22T03:02:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-04-22T19:55:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The CEO of 24 String Option, Richard Don Philip, better known as Richard Phillz has urged his fellow Germans to heed to COVID-19 precautionary measures in the country as the one month of lockdown elapses.", "title": "COVID-19: Richard Phillz urges Germans to heed to precautionary", "site": "@vanguardngrnews", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/richel.jpg?fit=600%2C590&ssl=1", "creator": "@vanguardngrnews"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "google-site-verification": "AjRfeo4BMZn8J99wiq7X1DKIfO_z-Dnma_6csxvuRRg", "alexaVerifyID": "GKUIyYVwwNAjNpxpU_bP3ZbGFeo", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/favicon.png?fit=16%2C16&ssl=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/04/covid-19-richard-phillz-urges-germans-to-heed-to-precautionary-measures/"}
