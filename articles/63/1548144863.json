Enjoy your own backyard for a time. Stop handshakes, hugs and hongi (a traditional Maori greeting in which people press their noses together).\n\n\n\n\"We are a tough, resilient people. We have been here before,\" the PM added.\n\n\n\nNew Zealand has already canceled several major events, including a memorial planned Sunday to mark the first anniversary of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 51 people died.\n\n\n\nArdern said more general restrictions on public gatherings would be imposed but details had not yet been finalized. \u2014 Agencies", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["saudigazette Newspaper", "saudi sazette", "saudigazette", "Saudi Arabia", "kingdom of saudi arabia", "latest news", "world", "opinion", "sports", "business", "technology", "life", "cartoon", "king salman", "New Zealand", "Ardern", "coronavirus", "self-isolation"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Mar 14 15:03:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Ardern said the new restrictions would be reviewed by the authorities in 16 days.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "images/fav.png", "meta_data": {"ROBOTS": "index,follow", "language": "English", "copyright": "Saudi Gazette", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Ardern said the new restrictions would be reviewed by the authorities in 16 days.", "keywords": "saudigazette Newspaper, saudi sazette, saudigazette, Saudi Arabia, kingdom of saudi arabia, latest news, world, opinion, sports, business, technology, life, cartoon, king salman , New Zealand, Ardern, coronavirus, self-isolation", "Idkeywords": 819709, "pageType": "article", "url": "http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/article/590896/World/Asia/All-arrivals-to-New-Zealand-must-self-isolate-for-14-days-PM?ref=rss&format=simple&link=link", "datePublished": "2020-03-14 15:03:00", "dateModified": "2020-03-14 15:03:00", "inLanguage": "en", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "All arrivals to New Zealand must self-isolate for 14 days: PM", "description": "Ardern said the new restrictions would be reviewed by the authorities in 16 days.", "image": "http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2020/03/14/1525982.jpg"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/article/590896/World/Asia/All-arrivals-to-New-Zealand-must-self-isolate-for-14-days-PM?ref=rss&format=simple&link=link", "title": "All arrivals to New Zealand must self-isolate for 14 days: PM", "description": "Ardern said the new restrictions would be reviewed by the authorities in 16 days.", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "Saudigazette", "image": "http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2020/03/14/1525982.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-14 15:03:00", "section": "World"}, "thumbnailUrl": "http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2020/03/14/1525982.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/article/590896"}
