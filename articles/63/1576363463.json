You can see it here, starting at 10 AM PT.\n\nThe Easter event, dubbed \"Music for Hope,\" comes as the country around Bocelli is still reeling from an astounding number of COVID-19 cases. Italy and the United States have each suffered more than 20,000 deaths during the pandemic.\n\nBocelli will be accompanied by pianist Emanuele Vianelli -- but Bocelli says he's not viewing this is a typical performance. It's clearly more spiritual to him. As Bocelli put it, \"It will not be an actual concert, but an occasion to pray together through music.\u201d\n\nHe added, \"It will be a sacred singing, because as we are taught, \u2018those who sing pray twice\u2019. It will be an invitation for everyone to join in the prayer.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sun Apr 12 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Andrea Bocelli is hoping his powerful voice can lift spirits around the world amid the coronavirus pandemic -- and he's performing live from hard-hit Italy.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "google-site-verification": "UUmtbUBf3djgPpCeLefe_PbFsOc6JGxfXmHzpjFLAEQ", "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "p": {"domain_verify": "933e74ace98032aadbc3328616280038"}, "robots": "index,follow", "description": "Andrea Bocelli is hoping his powerful voice can lift spirits around the world amid the coronavirus pandemic -- and he's performing live from hard-hit Italy.", "fb": {"app_id": 310610065699820}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tmz"}, "og": {"site_name": "TMZ", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.tmz.com/2020/04/12/andrea-bocelli-music-for-hope-live-duomo-di-milano/", "title": "Andrea Bocelli Performing 'Music for Hope' from Milan Cathedral", "description": "Andrea Bocelli is hoping his powerful voice can lift spirits around the world amid the coronavirus pandemic -- and he's performing live from hard-hit Italy.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/5b/16by9/2020/04/12/5b713c2d877041889397120cf76f64c3_xl.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TMZ", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Andrea Bocelli Performing 'Music for Hope' from Milan Cathedral", "description": "Andrea Bocelli is hoping his powerful voice can lift spirits around the world amid the coronavirus pandemic -- and he's performing live from hard-hit Italy.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/5b/16by9/2020/04/12/5b713c2d877041889397120cf76f64c3_xl.jpg"}, "application-name": "TMZ.COM", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#000000", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.rhythmnewmedia.tmz&referrer=utm_source%3Dsmartbanner%26utm_medium%3Dnative%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartbanner%26anid%3Dadmob", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=299948601, affiliate-data=ct=Smart_Banner&pt=201436, app-argument=https://www.tmz.com/2020/04/12/andrea-bocelli-music-for-hope-live-duomo-di-milano/?tmz#article", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TMZ.COM", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/msapplication-tile-image-270x270-v1.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.tmz.com/?adid=IE9pin", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#000000", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "TMZ | Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Photos;action-uri=https://www.tmz.com/photos/;icon-uri=https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2020/04/12/andrea-bocelli-music-for-hope-live-duomo-di-milano/"}
