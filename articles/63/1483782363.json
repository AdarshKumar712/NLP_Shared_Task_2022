He remains in a critical condition. Ben was expected to spend Tuesday at his father's bedside and did not attend training. A decision on his participation in the Boxing Day Test will be made in due course.\n\nEngland's captain, Joe Root, said he was not sure if Stokes would be available, but had words of support for the allrounder.\n\n\"All I want to do is stress the importance of respecting the privacy of Ben and his family,\" Root said. \"All the players and the squad want to throw our support behind him. It's crucial that comes first. We've got extra people out here and we feel like we've got a good squad to put out a competitive team.\"\n\nGed, a former New Zealand rugby league player, is in his early 60s and lives in Christchurch. He is a regular and popular figure at matches involving Ben and, on the face of things, appeared to be in robust good health.\n\nChris Woakes, meanwhile, has become the latest England player to come down with sickness, and did not train on Tuesday. England's preparations have been disrupted by a bug that prevented Stuart Broad, Jofra Archer and Jack Leach from taking part in the warm-ups.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["England tour of South Africa", "England", "England in SA 2019-20", "Ben Stokes", "England", "Cricket"], "tags": [], "authors": ["George Dobell In Johannesburg", "Shashank Kishore", "Umar Farooq", "Espncricinfo Staff", "Nagraj Gollapudi", "Peter Della Penna", "Vishal Dikshit In Mumbai", "Andrew Mcglashan", "Firdose Moonda", "Shamya Dasgupta"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "England allrounder misses training in order to be by his father's bedside | ESPNcricinfo.com", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://a.espncdn.com/prod/assets/icons/espncricinfo.svg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "description": "England allrounder misses training in order to be by his father's bedside | ESPNcricinfo.com", "news_keywords": "England tour of South Africa, England, England in SA 2019-20, Ben Stokes, England, Cricket", "keywords": "England tour of South Africa, England, England in SA 2019-20, Ben Stokes, England, Cricket", "DC.date.issued": "2019-12-24T14:05:56Z", "fb": {"app_id": 260890547115, "pages": 104266592953439}, "og": {"site_name": "ESPNcricinfo", "url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28364181/ben-stokes-father-admitted-hospital-serious-illness", "title": "Ben Stokes' father admitted to hospital with 'serious illness'", "description": "England allrounder misses training in order to be by his father's bedside | ESPNcricinfo.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fi%2Fcricket%2Fcricinfo%2F1210491_1296x729.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 729}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"site": "@espncricinfo", "url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28364181/ben-stokes-father-admitted-hospital-serious-illness", "title": "Ben Stokes' father admitted to hospital with 'serious illness'", "description": "England allrounder misses training in order to be by his father's bedside | ESPNcricinfo.com", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ESPNcricinfo", "googleplay": "ESPNcricinfo"}, "id": {"iphone": 417408017, "googleplay": "com.july.cricinfo"}, "url": {"iphone": "espncricinfo://x-callback-url/showStory?uid=28364181", "googleplay": "espncricinfo://x-callback-url/showStory?uid=28364181"}}}, "title": "Ben Stokes' father admitted to hospital with 'serious illness' | ESPNcricinfo.com", "medium": "article", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=417408017, app-argument=espncricinfo://x-callback-url/showStory?uid=28364181"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28364181/ben-stokes-father-admitted-hospital-serious-illness"}
