And with the number of deaths continuing a steady decade-long rise as more and more post-World War Two baby boomers reach old age, the number of births outnumbered the number of deaths nationwide by fewer than 1 million for the first time in decades.\n\nThat birth-driven increase in population did not occur this year in West Virginia, Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, all of which had more deaths than births.\n\nLoading...\n\nFewer immigrants\n\nThe estimated number of people moving annually to the U.S. from other parts of the world has steadily declined from the decade's highest total of 1,046,709 in 2016, the final year of the Obama administration.\n\nThis year's expected total of 595,348 immigrants would be the lowest yet in the Trump administration, which has proposed new restrictions on immigration and slashed the number of refugees being granted asylum.\n\nMany states have also had residents leaving for other states. Over the past nine years, New York is the state with the largest out-migration, losing 1,379,210 of its residents. They are among more than 2.5 million residents of the U.S. Northeast who have moved to other regions, making it the most widely abandoned part of the country.\n\nThe Midwest has had the second largest exodus. Of the 1,666,043 Midwesterners who have left since 2010, 865,873 hailed from Illinois.\n\nIn contrast, the 912,038 people who moved away from California over the past nine years were outnumbered by 1,021,544 moving there from abroad.\n\nOther states have had far more people moving in from elsewhere in the country than leaving. Texas has been a top recipient, with 1,145,629 arriving from other states and another 818,757 from abroad since 2010. It's nearly matched by Florida, with 1,289,614 residents of other states moving there and 1,107,039 more coming from abroad.\n\nThese demographic shifts will likely have consequences when U.S. congressional districts are reapportioned based on the 2020 census.\n\n\"From the calculations I've done,\" says William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow at The Brookings Institution, \"Texas could gain three seats, Florida could gain two seats. California fairly likely could lose a seat for the first time in its history.\"\n\nFrey predicts the aging of the workforce and the shrinking population growth rate will also have political ramifications.\n\n\"You know, a lot of our decline of births, or at least slow growth of births, can be countered by immigration from abroad,\" he tells NPR's Here and Now. \"And so immigration is going to be a much bigger part of our growth. So this is something to pay attention to as we move ahead into the next decade. What is our immigration policy going to be? How are immigrants going to fit into the rest of our society, in the rest of our economy?\"\n\n\n\n\"The big safety valve in all of this,\" Frey says, \"is immigration.\"\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["The Bookshelf", "Series", "NH Primary Dashboard: Stories, Interviews", "NHPR Events", "Foodstuffs: N.H.
