They say when they arrived to the business, the store's clerk advised there was no shooting, and that Pastor refused to leave the shop.\n\nAccording to the report, Pastor told police he was trying to purchase a sandwich, but the clerk stole his money.\n\nDuring the conversation, police say Pastor became argumentative and got \"uncomfortably close\" towards officers.\n\nHe eventually agreed to leave the business and walked towards his vehicle, the report says. But, that's when police say Pastor yelled, \"I'm going to let my dog go\" and released a brown and black Belgian Malinois.\n\nThe dog was following Pastor's orders to attack the officers - growling and showing its teeth, the report says.\n\nAs the dog lunged at one officer, police say they were forced to fire at the animal four times.\n\nAccording to the report, the dog fled the scene after being shot, and Pastor was tased and arrested.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["dog", "animal cruelty charges", "confrontation", "Fort Lauderdale", "shooting", "threat", "shop", "business", "charges", "sandwich shop", "call", "shooting", "sandwich", "business", "times", "dog", "Laspadas", "conversation", "store", "animal", "money", "dog", "animal cruelty charges", "scene", "confrontation", "dog", "dog", "orders", "Belgian Malinois", "teeth", "animal cruelty", "Fort Lauderdale"], "tags": ["News You Should Know", "Parkland Shooting"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Nov 11 12:25:01 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A Fort Lauderdale man is facing animal cruelty charges after allegedly ordering his dog to attack officers during a confrontation with police Sunday night.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://media.nbcmiami.com/2019/09/cropped-favicon-ami.png?fit=32%2C32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.5", "og": {"site_name": "NBC 6 South Florida", "type": "article", "description": "A Fort Lauderdale man is facing animal cruelty charges after allegedly ordering his dog to attack officers during a confrontation with police Sunday night.", "title": "Fort Lauderdale Man Arrested After Allegedly Using Dog to Attack Officers: PD", "url": "https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/fort-lauderdale-man-arrested-after-using-dog-to-attack-officers-pd/2063620/", "image": "https://media.nbcmiami.com/2019/09/11112019-Stefan-Pastor.jpg?fit=481%2C271"}, "google-site-verification": "HzcUi6Q6ShKtCzhpQt1Ib8nYsujnP87Ppt6B1_0vOR8", "fb": {"app_id": 91295312088}, "twitter": {"site": "@nbc6", "creator": "@nbc6", "description": "A Fort Lauderdale man is facing animal cruelty charges after allegedly ordering his dog to attack officers during a confrontation with police Sunday night.", "title": "Fort Lauderdale Man Arrested After Allegedly Using Dog to Attack Officers: PD", "url": "https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/fort-lauderdale-man-arrested-after-using-dog-to-attack-officers-pd/2063620/", "image": "https://media.nbcmiami.com/2019/09/11112019-Stefan-Pastor.jpg?fit=481%2C271"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBC6SouthFlorida"}, "description": "A Fort Lauderdale man is facing animal cruelty charges after allegedly ordering his dog to attack officers during a confrontation with police Sunday night.", "keywords": "dog, animal cruelty charges, confrontation, Fort Lauderdale, shooting, threat, shop, business, charges, sandwich shop, call, shooting, sandwich, business, times, dog, Laspadas, conversation, store, animal, money, dog, animal cruelty charges, scene, confrontation, dog, dog, orders, Belgian Malinois, teeth, animal cruelty, Fort Lauderdale", "sailthru.title": "Fort Lauderdale Man Arrested After Allegedly Using Dog to Attack Officers: PD", "sailthru.description": "A Fort Lauderdale man is facing animal cruelty charges after allegedly ordering his dog to attack officers during a confrontation with police Sunday night.", "sailthru.tags": "dog, animal cruelty charges, confrontation, Fort Lauderdale, shooting, threat, shop, business, charges, sandwich shop, call, shooting, sandwich, business, times, dog, Laspadas, conversation, store, animal, money, dog, animal cruelty charges, scene, confrontation, dog, dog, orders, Belgian Malinois, teeth, animal cruelty, Fort Lauderdale", "sailthru.type": "article", "sailthru.date": "2019-11-11T12:25:01+00:00", "taboola_lead": "video", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://media.nbcmiami.com/2019/09/cropped-favicon-ami.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/fort-lauderdale-man-arrested-after-using-dog-to-attack-officers-pd/2063620/"}
