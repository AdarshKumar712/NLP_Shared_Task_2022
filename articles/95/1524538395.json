I lost 20 pounds and trained like a mother,\u201d Barrymore said.\n\nThe 50 First Dates star also included multiple pictures of herself working out with Alton, both in the studio and at home, as well as inspirational poems about loving your body.\n\nRELATED: Drew Barrymore Doesn\u2019t Beat Herself Up About Her Weight: \u2018I Was Never Naturally That Thin\u2019\n\n\u201cShe is humorous and so so so knowledgeable about our bodies. I love her. Inside and out,\u201d the actress continued. \u201cWe hope the people in the wellness world are actually healthy in their hearts and minds.\u201d\n\nBarrymore added that Alton helped her to learn that, \u201cIt\u2019s not all about being terminators\u201d rather \u201cIt\u2019s about how to find yourself. How to be your best self.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Drew Barrymore/Instagram\n\nImage zoom Drew Barrymore/Instagram\n\n\u201cBut we need guidance and we hope our teachers are smart and wise and sane!

And it came at a time when Barrymore was going through her own life change after splitting from ex-husband Will Kopelman.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started the show, I was 145 lbs. and my life was kind of falling apart,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Victor [Fresco, the show\u2019s executive producer], can I lose 20 lbs. over the course of the show, and change my eyebrows and the height of my shoes and the body language and attitude and go from someone who\u2019s kind of na\u00efve and unhappy to someone who\u2019s empowered and alive?\u2019 And he said yes, and so I got to make that transformation.\u201d\n\nWhile her weight loss was purely for the role, Barrymore said it made her feel fantastic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, it\u2019s called Santa Clarita Diet but it is more than that for me with her,\u201d she told Today that same month. \u201cIt is doing her hair and putting on nails and accessorizing. Sheila has reminded me along way that sometimes putting a little into yourself does make you feel a little more alive.
