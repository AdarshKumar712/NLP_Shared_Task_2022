If we have the impression that we should act in any way, we will do so. By now we can only say, the situation in Berlin is safe and we do not want to be part of any speculations.\n\n\u201cAs long as there is no official ban by the authorities, we have decided to keep on working on the finalization of this year\u2019s Superbooth.\u201d\n\nThe statement concludes with a call to \u201crelax and make music\u201d - which seems like as good a way as any with dealing with the current situation - and a hopeful message that the organisers will \u201csee you at Superbooth 20 \u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll keep you updated with any further developments.\n\nWhat about Musikmesse?\n\nArguably of more pressing concern is whether Musikmesse, which is due to take place in Frankfurt between 1 and 4 April, will go ahead. Organisers Messe Frankfurt recently confirmed that the Light + Building exhibition, which it also organises, has been postponed until September 2020 (it was due to start on 8 March) in light of the coronavirus spread.\n\nWhile stressing the \u201chigh standard\u201d of medical facilities at its exhibition grounds, Messe Frankfurt said: \u201cMF is in close and constant contact with the health authorities and is implementing their recommendations and instructions accordingly. All our subsidiaries worldwide are also basing their actions on the recommendations and instructions of the relevant local authorities.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll keep you updated with any further developments.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ben Rogerson", "Computer Music", "Future Music"], "publish_date": "Mon Mar  2 10:37:17 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Organisers address concerns that the Berlin synth show could be cancelled", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/musicradar/164498/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "pub_date": "2020-03-02T10:37:17+00:00", "description": "Organisers address concerns that the Berlin synth show could be cancelled", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/musicradar/164498/apple-touch-icon.png", "og": {"title": "Superbooth makes coronavirus statement: \u201crelax and make music!\u201d", "site_name": "MusicRadar", "url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/superbooth-makes-coronavirus-statement-relax-and-make-music", "description": "Organisers address concerns that the Berlin synth show could be cancelled", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nwqoNe8DhD3Qi3btYhJsR-1200-80.jpg", "width": 1200}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/musicradar", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/musicradar"}, "fb": {"app_id": 159917314095849}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@MusicRadar", "title": "Superbooth makes coronavirus statement: \u201crelax and make music!\u201d", "description": "Organisers address concerns that the Berlin synth show could be cancelled", "creator": "@MusicRadar", "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nwqoNe8DhD3Qi3btYhJsR-1200-80.jpg", "account_id": 20065455}, "google-site-verification": "qZZHVW2IssShmgj4FTNlYnt1CenoFZNFEGdlCZcC5Oc", "p": {"domain_verify": "82751d94fa2f1d5f556332ccface919f"}, "taboola": {"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/superbooth-makes-coronavirus-statement-relax-and-make-music"}, "msvalidate.01": "CC462E6DF91492086145CA5EBDCB615E", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-03-02T10:37:17Z", "parsely-title": "Superbooth makes coronavirus statement: \u201crelax and make music!\u201d", "parsely-link": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/superbooth-makes-coronavirus-statement-relax-and-make-music", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nwqoNe8DhD3Qi3btYhJsR.jpg", "parsely-section": "Synths", "parsely-tags": "Category: Synths,Category: Recording,Category: Live,Category: Controllers,Category: Music tech,Category: News,gearnews,gearnews,channel_music_tech,type_news,channel_music_tech,type_news,serversidehawk", "parsely-author": "Ben Rogerson"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/superbooth-makes-coronavirus-statement-relax-and-make-music"}
