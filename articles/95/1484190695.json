When they arrived, they found Baber and a 49 year old man involved in a physical altercation in the street. The officers separated the two men and discovered that the older man had an injury to his left eye.\n\nIt was determined that Baber and others arrived at the residence shortly before the fight to pick up the victim\u2019s stepson. Witnesses said that the victim demanded that Baber leave the property before Baber threatened and attacked him. At some point during the fight, Baber managed to gouge the victim\u2019s eye with his fingers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLifeNet Ambulance responded to evaluate the victim\u2019s condition. He was transported to Christus St. Michael Hospital, where it was later learned that his optic nerve had been severed and the injury was considered serious. It is believed that he will likely lose his eye as a result of this assault.\n\nBaber was arrested and transported to the Bi-State Jail. He remains in custody with a $100,000 bond.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Field Walsh"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 17:13:07 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://1fbbr13qhcm41ppjbr450rsxt72-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Profile_Photo2017-336x336.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Suspect Arrested After Man Seriously Injured in Fight\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/txktoday.com\\/crime\\/suspect-arrested-after-man-seriously-injured-in-fight\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2019-12-31 11:13:07\",\"mod_date\":\"2019-12-31 11:13:07\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"29657\",\"author_id\":\"2\",\"author_name\":\"Field Walsh\",\"author_display_name\":\"Field Walsh\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Crime\",\"Featured\",\"News\"],\"image\":\"https:\\/\\/txktoday.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/12\\/baber.jpg\"}", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://txktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/baber.jpg", "secure_url": "https://txktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/baber.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Suspect Arrested After Man Seriously Injured in Fight | Texarkana Today", "description": "TEXARKANA, TEXAS \u2013 The Texarkana Texas Police Department arrested Gavin Baber, 20, of Texarkana Texas, for Aggravated Assault Causing Serious Bodily Injury on Saturday morning.
