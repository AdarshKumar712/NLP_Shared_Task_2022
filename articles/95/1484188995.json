It can have a chain effect, where no one is immune, including the customers.\n\nThe need for regulation in China was recently emphasized by policy advisers at the China 40 Finance Forum.\n\nAt the forum, it was recommended that a regulatory framework specifically for AI in finance be put in place. This is because regulation is most effective when carried out in a structured manner.\n\nPolicy advisers also urged China to look into improving the technology employed to strengthen industry-wide supervision.\n\nWith the banking industry becoming more \u2018intelligent\u2019, characterized by emerging technologies such as facial recognition and big data analysis, regulators must work hard to keep up.\n\nUtilizing obsolete technologies to tackle the rapidly evolving face of financing will no longer be enough to keep financial institutions in check.\n\nFurther, it was recommended that China avoid playing defense when it comes to these matters. They ought to constantly evaluate emerging technologies and establish industry-wide contingency plans.\n\nAlso, data privacy and security cannot be an afterthought. Authorities must, therefore, draft laws and regulations that will ensure that the data entrusted by consumers will not be manipulated or exploited.\n\nIn light of this, Xiao Gang, the former chief of China\u2019s securities regulator, cautioned against neglecting the use of AI, reiterating that it is not foolproof.\n\n\u201cThe key point now is how we make sure it is safe for use and include it with proper supervision\u201d.\n\nChina is no stranger to the catastrophe of dragging its feet when it comes to regulations.\n\nThe boom and bust of its online peer-to-peer(P2P) lending sector was largely due to regulations not being created on time.\n\nWhat was originally applauded as an important source of credit was being undermined by pyramid-scheme scandals, leading to great public discontent and broader government crackdowns.\n\nZhang Chenghui, chief of the finance research bureau at the Development Research Institute of the State Council, noted that policymakers must pull their weight, as change must start from them.\n\n\u201cWe suggest regulation on intelligent finance be written into the 14th five-year plan of the country\u2019s development, and each financial regulator \u2013 including the central bank, banking, and insurance regulators and the securities watchdog \u2013 should appoint its own chief technology officer to enhance supervision of the sector.\u201d\n\nThe importance of regulation extends outside the borders of China. Regardless of geographical location, the need for regulation applies to all that wish to use AI in the finance industry.\n\nTherefore, regulatory bodies must work together to put safeguards in place, ensuring that the industry can reap the most benefits from AI.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING", "SUPPLY CHAINS", "ANALYSIS", "OPERATIONS", "PLATFORMS", "EVENTS", "A GLIMPSE INTO 2020", "CIO", "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE", "NETWORK", "HOW BRANDS USE TECH", "AUTOMOTIVE TECH"], "authors": ["Emily Wong", "Soumik Roy", "November", "December", "January"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 07:00:43 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "AI is greatly used in the finance industry.
