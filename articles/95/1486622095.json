St. Louise Regional Hospital was cited for a strong culture of safety, high-quality patient care and the ability to meet the state\u2019s patient safety measures.\n\nThe Maternity Honor Roll\u2019s goal is to reduce cesarean rates in California. There are 500,000 births each year in California (one-eighth of all US c-section births) and in the past decade, the c-section birth rate has risen by 50 percent nationwide. Today, one-third of all babies are born via surgery\u2014significantly more than the federal Healthy People 2020 goal of 24.7 percent for low-risk deliveries, according to the state.\n\nReducing cesarean sections can result in lowering medical complications in first-time mothers, such as incidents of heavy bleeding, blood transfusions, infections, blood clots and longer recovery time compared with vaginal birth. Higher c-section rates carry risks for babies including potential injury during surgery, breathing problems, neonatal intensive care stays and lower breastfeeding rates.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Morgan Hill Times Staff"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 01:16:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.morganhilltimes.com/2019/11/cropped-mht_512-1-32x32.gif", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.morganhilltimes.com/2019/10/Saint-Louise-Regional-Hospital-2018-WEB.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.morganhilltimes.com/2019/10/Saint-Louise-Regional-Hospital-2018-WEB.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Morgan Hill Times | St. Louise recognized for patient safety", "description": "St. Louise Regional Hospital has been named to the State of California\u2019s Patient Safety Honor Roll for demonstrating safety across multiple departments, and to the state\u2019s Maternity Honor Roll for meeting or surpassing a statewide target aimed at reducing caesarean sections.\u00a0 \u201cWe are proud to be on both honor rolls,\u201d said Gloria Dela Merced, St. \u2026", "url": "https://morganhilltimes.com/st-louise-recognized-for-patient-safety/", "site_name": "Morgan Hill Times", "updated_time": "2020-01-04T01:18:47+00:00"}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/morganhilltimes", "section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2020-01-02T01:16:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-04T01:18:47+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "St. Louise Regional Hospital has been named to the State of California\u2019s Patient Safety Honor Roll for demonstrating safety across multiple departments, and to the state\u2019s Maternity Honor Roll for meeting or surpassing a statewide target aimed at reducing caesarean sections.\u00a0 \u201cWe are proud to be on both honor rolls,\u201d said Gloria Dela Merced, St. [\u2026]", "title": "Morgan Hill Times | St. Louise recognized for patient safety", "site": "@morganhilltimes", "image": "https://cdn.morganhilltimes.com/2019/10/Saint-Louise-Regional-Hospital-2018-WEB.jpg", "creator": "@morganhilltimes"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.morganhilltimes.com/2019/11/cropped-mht_512-1-270x270.gif"}, "canonical_link": "https://morganhilltimes.com/st-louise-recognized-for-patient-safety/"}
