I set my bar at a weight I was 20 years ago when I was active in sports, community, walking daily, etc. I have failed that one every year. So, for 2020, I sought resolution advice from the experts and I think I can check off most of these.\n\nExpert 1 says set my bar at a reasonable height.\n\nSo, here is what we came up with: Laugh a little louder, smile a little bigger, love a little deeper and walk through life a little slower.\n\nThat makes perfect sense to me because I have been traveling through life at breakneck speed, which has made many of the above unattainable.\n\nExpert 2 takes a different approach but still makes sense to me.\n\nTo put it simply: have hope, try new things, be active, see the good, say \u201cI love you\u201d more, challenge yourself, choose to be happy, eat better, enjoy today, forgive more readily, read more, become your best.\n\nSince many of these are already in my life, this group of resolutions should be just right for me.\n\nExpert 3 has more of the same easy attainable resolutions. Here they are: break a bad habit, learn a new skill, do a good deed, visit a new place, read a difficult book, write and send a letter, try new food, take a risk.\n\nOnce again, I believe this list would be easier to do than setting an unrealistic goal.\n\nActually, as I look at all three of these suggestions, I believe that almost everyone who reads this column could accomplish all three lists and feel really good about doing it.\n\nOne thing I would like to do is to learn a new language. I think this would be the hardest resolution on the list.\n\nThe second hardest for me would be to slow down and smell the roses. My life has always been in the fast lane and I never seem to be able to slow down. This is the year where I will do that with a little help from my friends.\n\nVisiting a new place is on my bucket list and this is the year I will do that.\n\nI would like to thank Snoopy and friends for their excellent advice.\n\nAnd to everyone I sincerely hope you set your goals at a level that is easily attainable. You will feel really great when you can honestly say, \u201cThis year I accomplished all my 2020 resolutions.\u201d\n\nHappy New Year.\n\nkashley1940@hotmail.com", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["More Keith Ashley", "For The Reformer", "Published On", "January", "Last Updated", "Pm Est"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 19:26:02 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "It is that time of the year when we start thinking about what we would like to accomplish in 2020.Most times, we set the bar way too high and, sometimes, it is impossible to attain New Year\u2019s resolutions.My favourite resolution for the last decade is to lose weight.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "915AE10930FFCE1EFBB9D7838CE66DE7", "description": "It is that time of the year when we start thinking about what we would like to accomplish in 2020.Most times, we set the bar way too high and, sometimes, it is impossible to attain New Year\u2019s resolutions.", "news_keywords": "column", "generator": "WordPress 5.3-RC3", "stats-full-init": "0.017", "stats-postmedia_theme_pre_initialize": "0.000", "stats-initialize": "0.016", "stats-postmedia_theme_post_initialize": "0.001", "stats-vip_load_plugins": "0.002", "stats-load_plugins": "0.012", "stats-register_widgets": "0.000", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.simcoereformer.ca/opinion/columnists/dont-set-the-resolution-bar-too-high?ia_markup=1"}, "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-01 14:26:02", "sailthru.title": "Don't set the resolution bar too high", "sailthru.tags": "brand-simcoereformer, category-column, hardest resolution, new place, new skill, new language, new things, new food, experts, resolution advice, friends, bar, hope", "sailthru.description": "It is that time of the year when we start thinking about what we would like to accomplish in 2020.
