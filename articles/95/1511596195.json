Junior Johannes Erm moved to second in the school record books with a 2020 NCAA/world leading mark of 6,114 points to be the 11th top performer in collegiate history.\n\nSophomore Karel Tilga battled in his first collegiate combined event competition for 6,019 points for runner-up honors and to take over the No. 6 spot in the school record books, No. 2 on this year\u2019s NCAA list, No. 3 on the 2020 world list and No. 22 collegiate performer of all-time.\n\nRedshirt freshman Kyle Garland was third in his first multi-event comp at UGA with 5,994 points, which ranks seventh in school history, third on the national performance list, fourth on the 2020 world list and become the No. 25 all-time collegiate performer.\n\nIn addition, freshman Jasmine Moore put her name up with some of the all-time greats in the women\u2019s triple jump by taking control of this year\u2019s women\u2019s triple jump list.\n\nFull Results: For full meet results, please visit: http://gado.gs/47h\n\n\u201cThis was a pretty good weekend for us and an outstanding meet for our elite competitors,\u201d said head coach Petros Kyprianou. \u201cOverall, we had some ups and downs, but our positives overshadowed any of the other spots where we still need to work. We are making everyone understand that Georgia is here and that we are and will be challenging for titles.\n\n\u201cThe highlight on the men\u2019s side was not only our heptathletes going 1-2-3, but the way they did it. We have the top four spots in the world right now, counting former Bulldog Garrett Scantling, and that speaks to the \u2018Decathlon Academy\u2019 we are trying to establish here. The guys today kept responding with big performances and pushed each other in a healthy way. They, along with Darius Carbin in the high jump, are working to put this men\u2019s team on the map. As always, we need leaders to step up and for our aces to perform when it counts.\n\n\u201cI think the high point of the weekend for the women was Jasmine Moore\u2019s monster jump in the triple. She came within eight centimeters or so of Keturah (Orji\u2019s) American junior record and continues to make strides. Having Titiana Marsh also leave with one of the top marks of her indoor career also gives up two strong reps in the triple on the national level. I was also impressed with Anna Hall\u2019s performance in the pentathlon this weekend and probably one of the more notable performances came from Kayla Smith in the pole vault. She showed everyone that she is not here to mess around this year and after a number of surgeries is taking that \u2018Mamba Mentality\u2019 and taking care of business. I am excited for her and to see her journey this year.\u201d\n\nAlready hanging around the top five nationally in both the long and triple jumps, freshman Jasmine Moore answered an opening foul in the triple with an effort of 45 feet, 7 \u00bc inches. This takes over the national lead, moves her to No. 3 on the 2020 world list and No. 2 in the UGA record books behind collegiate record holder Keturah Orji. Moore also had a mark of 45-0.50 in her series, which also would lead the country.\n\nSophomore Titiana Marsh opened at 43-0.25 in the triple and then improved to 43-8 on her fourth try for fourth place. This betters Marsh\u2019s spot on this year\u2019s national performance top-10 list.\n\nThe Drop sisters fought for a 2-3 finish in the 3000-meter Invitational to move into the nation\u2019s top 10 this year and establish a new top-five entry in the school record books. Junior Jessica Drop was the runner-up with a 9:18.64, which put her seventh on the national list for this season. Fellow junior Samantha Drop finished in 9:26.50 and jumped from 10th to fourth on the school\u2019s all-time top-10 list.\n\nSenior Amber Tanner nearly caught her personal record in the 800m set last year on her way to third-place honors on Saturday. She completed her laps in 2:05.72, which is expected to move her into the top 10 nationally and was only .13 off of her time from the 2019 SEC Championships.\n\nTwo weeks after establishing a new personal record, sophomore Imani Carothers bettered her 60m hurdle time to 8.18 to be third in the qualifying round and improve her No. 4 spot in the school record books. She finished fifth with an 8.21 for fifth in the final.\n\nFreshman Ellie Hall ran a season-best time of 9:51.76 to take sixth in the women\u2019s 3000m. Also of note, a pair of Georgia freshmen \u2013 Sam Bowers and Chase Condra \u2013 set fresh personal bests in the 3000m with an 8:25.13 and 8:26.95, respectively, to finish in the race\u2019s top 15.\n\nThe Bulldogs flexed their muscle in the multi-events with a 1-2-3 finish in the heptathlon and a runner-up showing in the pentathlon.\n\nFor the second week in a row, Erm bettered his personal record in the 60m hurdles to 8.03 (actually 8.028 behind Garland\u2019s 8.027) for 972 points and second place. Erm was also in second place overall going into the pole vault. He posted three clearances in the pole vault, including an effort of 15-9 to score 849 points, and breaks into the lead with just the 1000m to go. He completed the competition with a personal-best time in the 1000m at 2:36.02.\n\nTilga was third in the third heat after crossing the 60m hurdle finish line in 8.40. His 884 points, which was eighth in the competition, situated Tilga in third place with two events to go. He used a second attempt clearance at a UGA personal-best height of 15-5 to add 819 points to his total and put him in third place overall behind his teammates. Tilga stayed on pace with Erm in the 1000m and finished in 2:36.34.\n\nGarland won the 60m hurdles by .001 over Erm for 974 points. Garland registered a season best 8.03, which put him in the lead. He battled for a third and final try clearance at 14-5.25 to score 731 points. Garland was in second overall by just 44 points heading into the 1000m. He wrapped up his competition by completing his 1000m laps in 2:42.82.\n\nThe Bulldogs return to work in two weeks at the Husky Classic (Seattle, Wash.) and the Tyson Invitational in Fayetteville.\n\nHow To Keep Up With The Dogs: Updates from Georgia\u2019s track and field and cross country teams can always be found on Twitter/Instagram (UGATrack) and Snapchat (ugatrack).\n\nHeptathlon Scores\n\nName 60m LJ SP HJ Day 1\n\nJohannes Erm *6.99 ^24-11 *47-9.25 ^6-5 *3,373 pts.\n\n60mH PV 1000m TOTAL\n\n*8.03 15-9 *2:36.02 *6,114\n\nKarel Tilga 60m LJ SP HJ Day 1\n\n*7.18 24-4.25 50-8.25 *6-8.75 *3,401 pts.\n\n60mH PV 1000m TOTAL\n\n8.40 *15-5 *2:36.34 *6,019\n\nKyle Garland 60m LJ SP HJ Day 1\n\n*6.95 24-2.50 44-11.50 *7-0.25 *3,447 pts.\n\n60mH PV 1000m TOTAL\n\n8.03 14-5.25 *2:42.82 *5,994\n\n*UGA personal record; ^season best", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Razorback Invite", "track and field", "georgia bulldogs"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Feb  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://images.wltz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wltzShortcut-1.png", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.wltz.com/wp-content/themes/gtxcel/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "theme-color": "#121212", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bulldog Elite Put UGA on the NCAA, World Radar at Razorback Invite - WLTZ", "description": "Georgia\u2019s track and field teams exploded for a series of performances that repositioned the Bulldogs at the top or near the top of the 2020 NCAA and world performance lists at the Razorback Invitational in Fayetteville, Ark., on Saturday.
