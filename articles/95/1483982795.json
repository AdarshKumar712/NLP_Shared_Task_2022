The organiser of the planned rally - New Macau Gaming Staff Rights Association \u2013 called in November for the city\u2019s six gaming operators to award their staff a pay hike of \u201cat least 5 percent\u201d. On Monday this week, Cloee Chao, the head of the activist group, told GGRAsia the demonstration was not only about money, but also concern about staff \u201chealth issues\u201d.\n\nThe rally coincides with the start of a fresh government administration in Macau, under the new Chief Executive, Ho Iat Seng. Mr Ho was sworn into office on December 20 during the visit to Macau by China\u2019s President Xi Jinping, a date marking the 20th anniversary of the handover of Macau from Portuguese administration to that of China.\n\nIn September, New Macau Gaming Staff Rights Association sent the then Chief Executive-elect Mr Ho a wish list of gaming worker needs, based on what it said was a survey among frontline workers.\n\nThe route for Thursday\u2019s rally starts in the ZAPE district on Macau peninsula \u2013 close to where several major casino resorts including Wynn Macau, MGM Macau and StarWorld Hotel are located \u2013 and ends at the Macau government headquarters in Nam Van.\n\nAs well as a pay hike of at least 5 percent, the activist group is also calling for an annual bonus equating to two months of salary; the introduction of a mandatory allowance for working night shifts; and a \u201cfive working days\u201d per week policy for staff on shifts, Ms Chao noted to us.\n\nIn recent years, Macau operators have been awarding annual salary increases to their staff, with the announcements made at the beginning of the calendar year. Most operators have also been making supplementary payments to staff on a twice-yearly basis in recent times, on an ad hoc basis.\n\n\u201cWe also want 22-day annual leave,\u201d Ms Chao told us on Monday. That is understood to be more holiday than the mandated under local labour law.\n\nMacau workers are entitled to one rest day per week; 10 days of mandatory holidays and a minimum of six working days of annual leave after one year of service, according to local labour law.\n\n\u201cMany gaming workers are shift workers, and the existing holiday plan provided to them is too short,\u201d the gaming labour activist told GGRAsia. \u201cThat pressurises family relations for these workers, as they don\u2019t even have quality time to spend with their kids.\u201d\n\nMs Chao said her group would gather signatures from casino workers turning out for Thursday\u2019s demonstration, and submit them via a petition to be handed in at the government headquarters.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ggrasia_favicon24.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"image": "http://www.GGRAsia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Index-rates-city\u2019s-a-e1400118198232-150x150.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 3.9.1"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.GGRAsia.com/macau-casino-staff-plan-jan-2-rally-on-pay-conditions/"}
