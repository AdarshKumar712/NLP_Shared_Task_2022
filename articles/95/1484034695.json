grounds.\n\nA secondary school Special Needs Assistant (SNA) was unfairly dismissed after an allegation that he used cocaine on school grounds.\n\nThe Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) has ordered the school to pay the former SNA \u20ac1,000 for the unfair dismissal.\n\nWRC Adjudication Officer Kevin Baneham stated that there were \u201calarming deficiencies in the decision to dismiss\u201d the SNA who denied all drug related allegations.\n\nOne of the findings of the dismissal letter to the SNA was that drugs were on the school campus in December 2017 and Mr Baneham states that no such allegation was ever made.\n\nThe investigation into the SNA was sparked by an incident which occurred on the last day of the school term in June 2018.\n\nOn the day, the school organised a break-up party, with a staff sports day and some lunch.\n\nThis finished at 5pm and some staff went out later to a local pub.\n\nHowever, while there, an Assistant Principal (AP) said that he had walked into a bathroom on two SNAs.\n\nHe saw the two SNAs were standing with their back to the door and he felt that something was wrong.\n\nAccording to the AP\u2019s statement, the other SNA had his hand up to his face and the two scurried into cubicles.\n\nThe AP said that he believed that this was drugs. The AP has previously told the principal that he had been offered cocaine at a Christmas event in December 2017.\n\nThe SNA who was dismissed denied all allegations of drug use. The second SNA made a statement that he was shown cocaine at the June incident but did not want to partake.\n\nHowever, Mr Baneham stated that the second SNA\u2019s statement \u201cwas self-serving and unreliable\u201d.\n\nMr Baneham stated: \u201cIn a re-enactment of the classic Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, he laid blame on his co-accused. This is \u2018Operation Save-My-Job\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe sacked man has looked for other SNA roles but did not have reference to obtain such a role.\n\nOnline Editors", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["independent"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A secondary school Special Needs Assistant (SNA) was unfairly dismissed after an allegation that he used cocaine on school grounds.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn-04.independent.ie/static/65878e062b4890b48f61c325264e809c8a5eee53/img/favicon-independent.ico", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 96796398469, "app_id": 714861305308164}, "keywords": "independent", "description": "A secondary school Special Needs Assistant (SNA) was unfairly dismissed after an allegation that he used cocaine on school grounds.", "news_keywords": "School SNA was unfairly dismissed after drugs allegation - Independent.ie", "og": {"title": "School SNA was unfairly dismissed after drugs allegation - Independent.ie", "site_name": "Independent.ie", "description": "A secondary school Special Needs Assistant (SNA) was unfairly dismissed after an allegation that he used cocaine on school grounds.", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/school-sna-was-unfairly-dismissed-after-drugs-allegation-38826901.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/article37681805.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/GettyImages-187131634.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 513, "height": 342}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@Independent_ie", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/school-sna-was-unfairly-dismissed-after-drugs-allegation-38826901.html", "title": "School SNA was unfairly dismissed after drugs allegation", "description": "A secondary school Special Needs Assistant (SNA) was unfairly dismissed after an allegation that he used cocaine on school grounds.", "image": {"src": "https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/article37681805.ece/ALTERNATES/w135square/GettyImages-187131634.jpg"}, "domain": "Independent.ie"}, "published-date": "Wed, 01 Jan 2020 15:39:01 GMT", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=335158729, app-argument=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/school-sna-was-unfairly-dismissed-after-drugs-allegation-38826901.html"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/school-sna-was-unfairly-dismissed-after-drugs-allegation-38826901.html"}
