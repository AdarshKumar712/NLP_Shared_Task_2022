In other words, approximately nine times the distance between Earth and the Sun.\n\nBepiColombo spacecraft PA Images\n\nBepiColombo is a joint mission between European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), with the spacecraft planning to make nine planetary flybys over the course of the next few years as it makes its way to Mercury \u2013 the innermost planet of the Solar System.\n\nAdvert\n\nAt 5.24am on Friday, April 10, the spacecraft will be visible to those of us who own a decent pair of binoculars on Earth \u2013 particularly those in the southern hemisphere \u2013 as it comes within just a couple of thousand kilometres of the outermost layer of the atmosphere, at an altitude of 12,700 kilometres.\n\nBecause Mercury is so close to the Sun, the spacecraft cannot simply fly straight there. Instead, it has to use the gravity of Earth, Venus and Mercury to do so, with the next two flybys for Venus scheduled in October 2020 and August 2021.\n\nVenus NASA\n\nAlthough BepiColombo won\u2019t be visible to the naked eye, those with access to a small telescope, binoculars or even a camera might be able to catch the spacecraft as it continues its journey into space.\n\nJohannes Benkhoff, BepiColombo Project Scientist at ESA, said in a statement:\n\nThe flyby has an emotional effect. It\u2019s the last time that we can see the spacecraft from Earth, so we are inviting amateur and professional astronomers to observe it before it goes.\n\nThe planets Jupiter, Saturn and Mars will also be visible to the naked eye in the early hours of April 10 \u2013 although unfortunately the Moon will also be visible, making BepiColombo more difficult to observe.\n\nEarth/Mercury Size Comparison Brian Altmeyer/Flickr\n\nAdvert\n\nJoe Zender, BepiColombo Deputy Project Scientist at ESA, said \u2018the further south you are, the longer you should be able to see\u2019 the spacecraft, adding: \u2018If something appears as a moving star in the field of view of your telescope or camera, that will be Bepi.\u2019\n\nThis is only the start of the spacecraft\u2019s journey though; after buzzing Earth, it will make another eight flybys \u2013 of Venus and Mercury \u2013 before it finally settles into orbit.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Earth", "European Space Agency", "Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency", "Mercury", "Science", "Spacecraft"], "tags": ["Spacecraft", "Earth", "Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency", "European Space Agency", "Mercury"], "authors": ["Lucy Connolly"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Earth will be buzzed by a spacecraft on a mission to Mercury later this week, as it completes its first and only flyby of our planet.
