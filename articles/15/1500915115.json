Years ago Nico and Jessica had their first date at the establishment, which led to their engagement, followed by engagement photos at Central, which then led to the birth of their daughter Elara.\n\n\u201cOk Kelowna, it\u2019s time to show up and show out for the most precious little girl who is currently in the fight of her young life, \u201cread Central\u2019s post on Facebook.\n\n\u201cWe cannot imagine what this family is going through, but one thing we do know is that we must help in any way we can.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 25, at 5 p.m. Central will be hosting a fundraiser for Elara who is currently battling at B.C. Children\u2019s Hospital in Vancouver.\n\nThe event will feature a \u201cSweet and Spicy\u201d burger developed by the Isagawas that best represent Elara\u2019s personality. 100 per cent of sales from this burger from over the entire weekend will be donated to the family.\n\nAttendees will also have an opportunity to make cash donations and participate in a silent auction with some prizes donated by local businesses.\n\nFor more information visit Central\u2019s Facebook page or the Burgers for Elara at Central event page.\n\nREAD MORE: Kelowna family almost reaches fundraising goal for daughter diagnosed with tumour\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Celebrations of Life"], "authors": ["Daniel Taylor"], "publish_date": "Tue Jan 21 08:15:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The event is scheduled for Jan. 25 and will feature opportunities for cash donations", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://2sxb3ruikat4fdj68130mvc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/BlackPress/assets/images/icons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "gpsid": 20225810, "generator": "AMP for WP 0.9.98.2", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Lake Country Calendar", "url": "https://www.lakecountrycalendar.com/news/kelowna-restaurant-to-hold-fundraiser-for-one-year-old-with-cancer/", "title": "Kelowna restaurant to hold fundraiser for one-year-old with cancer - Lake Country Calendar", "description": "The event is scheduled for Jan. 25 and will feature opportunities for cash donations", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.lakecountrycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20225810_web1_200110-KCN-M-Screen-Shot-2020-01-10-at-10.45.03-AM-1024x683.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 683}, "secure_url": "https://www.lakecountrycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20225810_web1_200110-KCN-M-Screen-Shot-2020-01-10-at-10.45.03-AM-1024x683.jpg"}, "description": "The event is scheduled for Jan. 25 and will feature opportunities for cash donations", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2020-01-21T08:15:00-08:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kelowna restaurant to hold fundraiser for one-year-old with cancer - Lake Country Calendar", "description": "The event is scheduled for Jan. 25 and will feature opportunities for cash donations", "image": "https://www.lakecountrycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20225810_web1_200110-KCN-M-Screen-Shot-2020-01-10-at-10.45.03-AM-1024x683.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 234578876601966}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.lakecountrycalendar.com/news/kelowna-restaurant-to-hold-fundraiser-for-one-year-old-with-cancer/"}
