Madrid and Barcelona, Spain\u2019s two worst-affected areas, will not reach normality until July 6, at the earliest.\n\nMr S\u00e1nchez gained the backing of centrist party Ciudadanos to reach a narrow majority, but he promised to study alternative legal ways of enforcing restrictions on movement for the remainder of the lockdown phase-out.\n\nFor the first time, the country\u2019s main conservative opposition Popular Party (PP) joined the hard-Right Vox in voting against the state of emergency.\n\n\u201cYou want us to choose between you and chaos, but it\u2019s impossible because you are chaos,\u201d PP leader Pablo Casado told Mr S\u00e1nchez.\n\n\u201cYou are incapable of protecting Spaniards aside from this brutal confinement.\u201d\n\nMr S\u00e1nchez countered that the state of emergency had saved \u201cthousands of lives\u201d, and confirmed that his government would pass a minimum household income next week because \u201cSpain cannot accept the sight of queues at food banks\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister said that a period of national mourning would be declared once all areas had reached phase 1 of de-escalation, meaning flags will be flown at half-mast and no festive public events permitted - even were lockdown rules to allow for them.\n\nThe PP and Vox have been demanding a declaration of official mourning since early April, when the crisis was at its height.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["James Badcock"], "publish_date": "Wed May 20 16:10:50 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has apologised to the country for mistakes made by his Left-wing coalition government over handling of one of the world's worst covid-19 epidemics.
