West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, also the TMC supremo, congratulated party workers on the occasion and said TMC is observing the day as \u2018Nagorik Dibas\u2019 (Citizens\u2019 Day) at the booth-level. \u201cWe are observing the foundation day of @AITCofficial as \u2018Nagorik Dibas\u2019 (Citizens\u2019 Day) in every booth of #Bangla. We all are citizens and Trinamool will continue to fight for the rights of the people. Jai Hind. Jai Bangla. \u201c#Trinamool22 Today @AITCofficial turns 22.\n\nThe journey which began on January 1, 1998 has been full of struggles, but we have been steadfast in our resolve to fight for the people. We thank Maa-Mati-Manush for their constant support. Our workers are our biggest assets,\u201d she tweeted. TMC general secretary Subrata Bakshi said laws are passed to help the people and not to divide the country. \u201cThe amended Citizenship Act is anti-people. It wants to divide the country on religious lines. So, if the people don\u2019t accept it, this law has to be withdrawn,\u201d he said.\n\nClaiming that the people of West Bengal have started rejecting the BJP, Bakshi hinted that the party would use the CAA and the proposed country-wide NRC as its main issues in the upcoming municipal elections in the state. Elections to around 107 municipalities of the state including the Kolkata Municipal Corporation are due in April-May this year. The civic polls, in which about 60 per cent voters of the state would be eligible to take part, are being tipped as the \u2018mini assembly election\u2019 ahead of the crucial 2021 state polls.\n\nParties believe that the results of the civic polls will indicate the possible outcome of the assembly elections. Banerjee had last week instructed party workers to conduct various programmes to observe the TMC\u2019s foundation day. The district TMC leaders have organised flag-hoisting programmes and street corner meetings to discuss and highlight the achievements of the state government and speak against the amended Citizenship Act, party sources said. Banerjee, who has been at the forefront in opposing the CAA and nation-wide NRC, has been crisscrossing the state, holding protest marches and rallies against the new citizenship law. On the party\u2019s foundation day, TMC activists also organised blood donation camps in several parts of the state.\n\nThe TMC was founded by Mamata Banerjee on January 1, 1998 with an aim to oust the then Left Front regime from power. The party achieved its goal in May 2011 after forging an alliance with the Congress.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["west bengal", "nrc", "west bengal", "congress", "mamata banerjee", "chief minister mamata banerjee", "india news", "caa protests", ""], "tags": ["Mamata Banerjee", "Congress", "BJP"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 21:26:01 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The TMC was founded by Mamata Banerjee on January 1, 1998, with an aim to oust the then Left Front regime from power.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://images.financialexpress.com/2018/10/fe-fav-1.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1100", "ahrefs-site-verification": "00120a3a212c33eda15559fea6d0731769fd82f538180bd0a2dbe12991312ab4", "description": "The TMC was founded by Mamata Banerjee on January 1, 1998, with an aim to oust the then Left Front regime from power.", "news_keywords": "West Bengal, nrc, west bengal, congress, mamata banerjee, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, india news, caa protests,", "keywords": "west bengal, nrc, west bengal, congress, mamata banerjee, chief minister mamata banerjee, india news, caa protests,", "msvalidate.01": "CCA9DA5B985004F4462DA743E776C636", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/tmc-observes-foundation-day-as-citizens-day-vows-to-continue-protests-till-caa-is-withdrawn/1809871/", "site_name": "The Financial Express", "title": "TMC observes foundation day as \u2018Citizens\u2019 Day\u2019, vows to continue protests till CAA is\u00a0withdrawn", "description": "The TMC was founded by Mamata Banerjee on January 1, 1998, with an aim to oust the then Left Front regime from power.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.financialexpress.com/2020/01/cats-85.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 660, "height": 440}, "updated_time": "2020-01-01T21:26:01+05:30"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@FinancialXpress", "title": "TMC observes foundation day as \u2018Citizens\u2019 Day\u2019, vows to continue protests till CAA is\u00a0withdrawn", "description": "The TMC was founded by Mamata Banerjee on January 1, 1998, with an aim to oust the then Left Front regime from power.", "creator": "@FinancialXpress", "url": "https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/tmc-observes-foundation-day-as-citizens-day-vows-to-continue-protests-till-caa-is-withdrawn/1809871/", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.financialexpress.com/2020/01/cats-85.jpg", "width": 660, "height": 440}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T21:26:01+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T21:26:01+05:30"}, "google-site-verification": "gnihf3YiUuUdPvHPclHT6JNmAwi1ues6l85YQL-3g8I", "generator": "WordPress 4.9.4", "fb": {"pages": 157671354275436}, "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/tmc-observes-foundation-day-as-citizens-day-vows-to-continue-protests-till-caa-is-withdrawn/1809871/?ia_markup=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://images.financialexpress.com/2018/10/fe-fav-1.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/tmc-observes-foundation-day-as-citizens-day-vows-to-continue-protests-till-caa-is-withdrawn/1809871/"}
