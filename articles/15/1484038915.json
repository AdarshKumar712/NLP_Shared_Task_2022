Of late, Bollywood has seen the rise of many fine actors reaching the pedestal and making a mark for themselves.\n\nThese actors don\u2019t need a big budget project or a big banner to back them, all they want is a great concept and they get their acting chops on the table. Moreover, these following actors have made a mark for themselves in such a short time that the audiences are amazed by them and they can\u2019t get enough of them.\n\n- Sponsored -\n\nHere is a list of 5 actors that are totally in demand at the movies right now and rightfully so.\n\nKartik Aaryan\n\nWith absolute no connection to Bollywood, a complete outsider today reigns at the box-office like no one\u2019s business. Kartik Aaryan had a great year in 2019 with two back to back hits with Luka Chuppi and Pati Patni Aur Woh. The actor had both his releases hitting the bull\u2019s eye and raking in the moolah. Kartik Aaryan has proved himself in the last two years that he\u2019s here to stay. He has earned a wide reach amidst the audience and he\u2019s masses favourite. Kartik Aaryan is easily the massiest actor in tinsel town. Right from his dance steps to his hairstyle, everything is trending about him on social media. This actor is for the masses and by the masses, we surely want more of him!\n\nAyushmann Khurrana\n\nJust the way a scientist keeps experimenting something new in his lab, Ayushmann Khurrana does the same with his roles every Friday. The actor has done some spectrum of characters in Bollywood and each one is completely different from the other. This year he had Article 15, Bala and Dreamgirl, three releases and all three different from others and three bonafide superhits. Ayushmann Khurrana has made not just our industry but the entire nation realize that content is King and if the right concept is narrated the right way, you surely have a winning lottery ticket in your hand. His bag is full of exciting offers and we\u2019re curious about those big-screen treats.\n\nVicky Kaushal\n\nVicky Kaushal in his surprising act in Uri The Surgical Strike, made everyone sit back and take him seriously as an actor. Last year his act as Kamlesh in Sanju showed a different side of him as an artist and this year with Uri, it was a wake-up call for the filmmakers that he can carry a film on his shoulders and do a great job at it. Vicky Kaushal moreover enjoys supreme love and affection among the female audience. After all the Mills & Boons\u2019 description of tall, dark and handsome is no just a myth.\n\nNow, this actor is par excellence. Ranveer Singh has reinvented himself with each of his films. If he can play a warrior king, he can also transform into a street rapper. This actor has given a tough competition to his contemporaries and is not tired of giving great performances back-to-back. Off-screen, his love story is rocking and on-screen he\u2019s making us fall in love with his movies and his rules.\n\nIf you have someone dancing alongside Hrithik Roshan and it\u2019s difficult to keep your attention on Hrithik, then you surely have a superstar in the making. Tiger Shroff is one actor who times and again shows the industry and the audience, that he may fall but he rises 10 times higher. This year with his blockbuster release War, Tiger Shroff wasn\u2019t just all about brawn and dance, he also got those acting chops to make a mark alongside Tiger Shroff. This young actor has proved his mettle several times and we are quite impressed.\n\nTill then you guys stay tuned to this space for more updates, news, and gossip.\n\nAlso Read: List of upcoming Bollywood movies 2020", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Kartik Aaryan", "Tiger Shroff", "Features", "Ayushmann Khurrana", "Ranveer Singh", "Trending", "Featured"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 14:30:08 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Of late Bollywood has seen the rise of many fine actors reaching the pedestal and making a mark for themselves.
