A spokesman for Apollo confirmed its withdrawal while Varde declined to comment.\n\nThat leaves Cerberus Capital Management LP, SSG Capital Management, and Kotak Investment Advisors Ltd. in the race for the real-estate focused lender, three people said. Representatives for Cerberus, SSG and Kotak declined to comment.\n\nAltico\u2019s troubles follow a spate of defaults among Indian shadow banks over the last 16 months, making it harder for the sector to raise funds. The cash crunch is also spilling over into the broader economy, given that these lenders fund everything from the construction of condominiums to purchases of personal goods like cars and phones.\n\nApollo was only willing to inject part of the money creditors sought, while Varde wanted to wait for a turnaround in Altico before investing, two people said.\n\nThis story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.
