Police said the man had claimed he was Jesus Christ and had sent the canine to heaven.\n\nThe Daily Times reported Tuesday that Joseph Cryer pleaded guilty in late December to aggravated animal cruelty. The Ocean City man had already served 104 days in jail before he received his sentence.\n\nCryer was a former Ocean City mayoral candidate. He was arrested in September.\n\nPolice said they came to his house after a woman heard screaming from Cryer\u2019s home. Police said an officer noticed a significant amount of blood outside Cryer\u2019s house and that Cryer told the officer that he was Jesus Christ\n\nAccording to police, Cryer said he hit the dog on the head with a hammer until it died and went to heaven. He said the dog was happy being with his brother who was also in heaven.\n\nPolice said an animal control officer who recovered the dog noticed a hole in the dog\u2019s head and a significant cut across the dog\u2019s neck.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.
