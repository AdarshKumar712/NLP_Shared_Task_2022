The royal couple had also said they intended to become financially independent following the decision. The Duke and Duchess said they planned to divide their time between the UK and North America but would continue to \"fully support\" the Queen and raise their son with an appreciation for the royal tradition. Buckingham Palace responded with a statement saying: \"'We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through\". It's understood no royals including the monarch or Prince William were consulted by the Duke and Duchess before their decision.
