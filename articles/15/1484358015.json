Fein MP Francie Molloy said the death had caused shock and sadness in the local community.\n\nThe Mid Ulster MP said: \"Any death on our roads is a tragedy, particularly when someone so young loses their life.\n\n\"My thoughts are with the family and friends of this young man at this sad time.\u201d\n\nPolice have appealed for anyone who may have witnessed the crash or who saw either of the cars
