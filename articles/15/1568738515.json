UN headquarters in New York is preparing for just such a thing.\n\nIn New York, the UN is hiring (from Dec 2019 through Feb 2020) highly qualified (Master Degree required) military types as officers for \u201cdisarmament\u201d and \u201cre-integration\u201d duties pertaining to what they call their Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration protocol (DDR). These are not grunts, but officers, and it sounds to me like this NY hiring, and the training will follow, is to prepare a cadre of leadership that can deploy anywhere in the US.\n\nIn case you\u2019re interested (and I wish absolutely nobody would apply):\n\nSo the UN wants to disarm the population. They are preparing to use some violent conflagration or other as their starting point. They will probably do this piece-a-meal, a little here, a little there, at first. But make no mistake: a disarmed population is the goal. History has proven that disarming of a population is generally followed by massacres of the population by government authorities.\n\nDemobilization is the formal and controlled discharge of active combatants from armed forces or other armed groups. The first stage of demobilization may extend from the processing of individual combatants in temporary centres to the massing of troops in camps designated for this purpose (cantonment sites, encampments, assembly areas or barracks). (New York UN Office Recruits Paramilitary Troops for \u2018Disarmament\u2019 and \u2018Reintegration\u2019 of US Civilians Bold added.)\n\nInternment camps in the United States? Haha, never happen? Well it won\u2019t if the UN is defunded and thrown out. But until and unless that happens, internment camps in the United States are in their plans.\n\nThe second stage of demobilization encompasses the support package provided to the demobilized, which is called reinsertion. \u2026 Reinsertion is a form of transitional assistance to help cover the basic needs of ex-combatants and their families \u2026 . (New York UN Office Recruits Paramilitary Troops for \u2018Disarmament\u2019 and \u2018Reintegration\u2019 of US Civilians Bold added.)\n\nSo for some, for those that can be successfully re-educated (to borrow a Chinese Communist term), detainment won\u2019t be forever. Be ready to disavow your Second Amendment rights, and your love of Constitutional freedoms generally so that you can get your assistance package and go free \u2013 as a dependent vassal, of course!\n\nReintegration is the process by which ex-combatants acquire civilian status and gain sustainable employment and income. Reintegration is essentially a social and economic process with an open time-frame, primarily taking place in communities at the local level. It is part of the general development of a country and a national responsibility, and often necessitates long-term external assistance. (New York UN Office Recruits Paramilitary Troops for \u2018Disarmament\u2019 and \u2018Reintegration\u2019 of US Civilians Bold added.)\n\nThis is nation-building: a process that has proven monstrously profitable. It is a refinement of the process. \u201cIt is part of the general development of a country.\u201d \u201cReintegration\u201d re-builds society from the ground of person-hood up. The only reason the UN needs to involve itself in re-integrating a person into society is to monitor that person to ensure that they become a citizen in the UN-approved model. This implements a form of the Chinese Communist social scoring system. It is \u201clong-term\u201d \u2026 as in permanent.\n\nOh the UN, that affable, bungling, bureaucratic, distant, European cousin of the US Federal government. Well, not so distant. They\u2019re over here hoping to muck around; and not so affable and bungling. They are corrupt as hell and serious as a heart attack. Well, serious as a tyrannical police state, actually. And they want to welcome you home, citizen, every day!\n\nOrganic Prepper has also written an article about this: The UN is Hiring\u2026\n\nSee Also:\n\nJoin the conversation.
