Chan School of Public Health, called the new label changes an \u201cimportant step forward.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the fact that manufacturers are now required to disclose added sugars on labels.\n\n\u201cBecause higher added sugar intake has been associated with a wide range of adverse health consequences, it is important to distinguish added sugars from natural sugars in a product,\u201d Hu said.\n\nConsuming too much added sugar has been linked to weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nDifferentiating between naturally occurring and added sugar could also clear up confusion among Americans who think that all sugar is bad for them.\n\nKitchin said that Americans who are trying to lower their sugar intake sometimes eschew foods like milk, which has naturally occurring sugar, and miss out on nutrients along the way.\n\n\u201cIn people\u2019s overexuberance to decrease sugars, they may be decreasing some healthy foods,\u201d she said.\n\nIn general, Kitchin hopes the changes will encourage customers to take more interest in reading nutrition labels and prompt them to compare foods\u2019 nutritional information before they buy.\n\n\u201cHopefully, the information on the new label will not only help consumers make more informed decisions about their food and beverage choices, but also motivate food manufacturers to improve nutritional quality of their products,\u201d Hu added.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020, ABC Audio.
