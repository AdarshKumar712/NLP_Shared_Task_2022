The fate of four other policemen who were at the checkpoint was unknown, said Mohammad Afzel Hadid, head of the provincial council.\n\nIn another attack on December 31 seven members of the security forces were killed in a gun battle with the Taliban, according to Jawad Hajri, the provincial governor's spokesman. He said 10 Taliban fighters were also killed.\n\nEarlier this week, the Taliban said it has no intention of declaring a temporary cease-fire in Afghanistan.\n\n'In the past few days, some media have been releasing untrue reports about a cease-fire... The fact is that, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has no cease-fire plans,' the Taliban said in a December 30 statement.\n\nTaliban militants continue to stage near-daily attacks targeting Afghan and U.S. forces, as well as government officials -- even as the group holds peace talks with a U.S. envoy tasked with negotiating an end to the military conflict in Afghanistan.\n\nBased on reporting by AP, AFP, and dpa\n\nCopyright (c) 2018.
