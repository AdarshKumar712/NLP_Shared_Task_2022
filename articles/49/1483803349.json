It solves the phosphate problem in an elegant and plausible way,\" Toner said.\n\nThe researchers explained that phosphate levels could climb even higher, to a million times levels in seawater, when lake waters evaporate during dry seasons, along shorelines, or in pools separated from the main body of the lake.\n\n\"The extremely high phosphate levels in these lakes and ponds would have driven reactions that put phosphorus into the molecular building blocks of RNA, proteins, and fats, all of which were needed to get life going,\" said David Catling, a professor at UW.\n\nThe carbon dioxide-rich air on the early Earth, some four billion years ago, would have been ideal for creating such lakes and allowing them to reach maximum levels of phosphorus, the researchers said.\n\nCarbonate-rich lakes tend to form in atmospheres with high carbon dioxide, which dissolves in water to create acid conditions that efficiently release phosphorus from rocks, they said.\n\n\"The early Earth was a volcanically active place, so you would have had lots of fresh volcanic rock reacting with carbon dioxide and supplying carbonate and phosphorus to lakes,\" Toner said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Physical sciences", "Chemistry", "Chemical elements", "Phosphorus", "Pnictogens", "Planet", "Phosphorus cycle", "Iron ore", "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "assistant professor", "Jonathan Toner", "University of Washington", "chemical reactions", "Kenya", "David"], "tags": ["environment.", "Environment"], "authors": ["Press Trust Of India"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Read more about Life may have originated in lakes with high phosphorus: Study on Business Standard.
