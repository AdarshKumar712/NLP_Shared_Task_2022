That article has since led to others from The Times, Univision and The Washington Post, which first reported on Tuesday the latest round of firings at Trump Winery.\n\nMr. Romero said he believed the Trump Organization thought it could get away with continuing to hire undocumented laborers, who feared repercussions that could disrupt their lives or livelihoods even though some had worked at Trump properties for a decade. But he said that since the Times story last year, more have emerged, empowered to speak. He now represents about 40 undocumented people who have worked at Trump properties.\n\n\u201cThese workers have been there for many years,\u201d Mr. Romero said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to hear about their firing. But many of them have been able to move on and get better paying jobs. At first when you hear about them, you feel bad. But then you realize that maybe it wasn\u2019t the best environment to work in.\u201d\n\nIn an audio recording from one of the firings this week at Trump Winery, a manager told a worker named Omar Miranda that the company had completed a review of immigration paperwork and found that his \u201cdid not seem genuine or was insufficient.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Mike Baker"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Facing a public reckoning, the Trump Organization has been cracking down on its undocumented laborers.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/vi-assets/static-assets/favicon-4bf96cb6a1093748bf5b3c429accb9b4.ico", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2019-12-31T22:58:11.885Z", "modified": "2019-12-31T22:58:11.885Z", "section": "U.S.", "tag": "Virginia", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000006898918, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/549da473-cb9c-5575-b96b-64d9f5c0afef", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/5bcd0e0b43b84bea9d9a5fbd27a7283e", "description": "Facing a public reckoning, the Trump Organization has been cracking down on its undocumented laborers.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/27/us/31trump-workers/00trumpwine6-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "byl": "By Mike Baker", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/27/us/31trump-workers/00trumpwine6-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Foreign Workers,Illegal Immigration;Undocumented Migrants,US Politics,Trump Organization,Donald Trump,Virginia", "pdate": 20191231, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/us/trump-undocumented-workers-winery.html", "type": "article", "title": "Firings at Trump Property Cap Year of Purging Undocumented Workers", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/27/us/31trump-workers/00trumpwine6-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "alt": "Several workers at Trump Winery in Charlottesville, Va., were fired this week."}, "description": "Facing a public reckoning, the Trump Organization has been cracking down on its undocumented laborers."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/us/trump-undocumented-workers-winery.html", "title": "Firings at Trump Property Cap Year of Purging Undocumented Workers", "description": "Facing a public reckoning, the Trump Organization has been cracking down on its undocumented laborers.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/27/us/31trump-workers/00trumpwine6-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v2.jpg", "alt": "Several workers at Trump Winery in Charlottesville, Va., were fired this week."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/549da473-cb9c-5575-b96b-64d9f5c0afef"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "us", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/us/trump-undocumented-workers-winery.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/549da473-cb9c-5575-b96b-64d9f5c0afef", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/us/trump-undocumented-workers-winery.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/us/trump-undocumented-workers-winery.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/us/trump-undocumented-workers-winery.html"}
