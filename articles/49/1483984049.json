Yes yes \u201cyou can\u2019t do it midway through the season\u201d but the 20 clubs must surely be able to come together and realise this situation is disastrous for them collectively. https://t.co/AFldEVE5eM \u2014 Michael Cox (@Zonal_Marking) January 1, 2020\n\nKlopp has seen Liverpool involved in their fair share of similar incidents, and he is in favour of a change which would see the attacker given the benefit of any doubt in tight situations.\n\nThe German boss told a press conference: \"We had a manager meeting with UEFA and it was decided to make the line bigger [wider]. I would like that.\n\n\"I don't know who would decide that. That it doesn't take so long until a decision would also be better.\n\n\"It's not the biggest problem in the world. We want to have clarification and right decisions, offside we get that now, the only problem is it feels like half an hour until the toenail is offside. But that's the decision.\"\n\nKlopp was speaking ahead of Liverpool's clash with newly promoted at Anfield on Thursday, where his side will be looking to extend their 36-match unbeaten run.\n\nThe Reds have won their last 10 in the Premier League, and have only dropped points in one of their 19 fixtures this season.\n\nLiverpool have stormed 13 points clear of their rivals at the top of the table, despite having been forced to negotiate their way through a hectic winter schedule which included a Club World Cup venture in .\n\nArticle continues below\n\nA 1-0 home win over Wolves on Sunday marked their latest triumph, with Klopp fully focused on keeping the squad as fresh as possible as the fixture list continues to pile up.\n\nHe added: \"Four days is a proper recovery so that's okay but after that, there's another game. It isn't just about rhythm, we don't have massive alternatives in all positions, some will have to go again and hopefully, they can.\n\n\"But the players are all in good shape, so I'm happy about that. But it's not always easy to make the right decisions.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Liverpool", "Premier League", "Burnley", "Aston Villa", "Sheffield United", "Burnley v Aston Villa", "Liverpool v Sheffield United", "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 14:26:21 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has revealed how he'd solve the ongoing issues surrounding VAR, with Aston Villa falling victim to another controversial decision on New Year's Day.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "description": "Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has revealed how he'd solve the ongoing issues surrounding VAR, with Aston Villa falling victim to another controversial decision on New Year's Day.", "keywords": "Liverpool,Premier League,Burnley,Aston Villa,Sheffield United,Burnley v Aston Villa,Liverpool v Sheffield United,J\u00fcrgen Klopp", "robots": "max-snippet:1000, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:1000, INDEX, FOLLOW", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@goal"}, "og": {"title": "Klopp reveals how he'd solve VAR shambles as latest controversy sees Grealish goal ruled out | Goal.com", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.goal.com/en/news/klopp-reveals-how-hed-solve-var-shambles-as-latest/8lm716d43zqr1hxy4bizdkwxn", "description": "Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has revealed how he'd solve the ongoing issues surrounding VAR, with Aston Villa falling victim to another controversial decision on New Year's Day.", "image": "https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/GOAL/d8/53/wesley-var-jurgen-klopp_1usvvxdn3jpng1noyaenjwc82b.jpg?t=1690240031&quality=100&h=300"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#081f2c", "theme-color": "#081f2c", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.kokteyl.goal"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.goal.com/en/news/klopp-reveals-how-hed-solve-var-shambles-as-latest/8lm716d43zqr1hxy4bizdkwxn"}
