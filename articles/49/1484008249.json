A Post photo editor had just plunked down $17 for a jerk chicken dinner at the store across from Bryant Park on Sunday night when he spotted the grungy gourmand ignoring numerous \u201cNo Sampling\u201d signs to treat the bar like his personal feed bag.\n\nHomeless people qualify as \u201coppressed.\u201d That means the whole city is their personal feed bag.\n\nSometimes he used the serving spoons to shovel food into his own cup\u2026\n\nBut at other points, he simply dug in with his visibly dirty mitts, grabbing food from the trays and shoving it directly into his mouth, wet with drool and framed by a scraggly beard. In the closest thing to a display of personal hygiene from the man, he stopped every now and then to lick his fingers clean.\n\nNo one moved to stop him. That would have been oppression. One employee reported that he comes in there and behaves like that \u201call the time.\u201d It\u2019s DeBlasioLand, what are you gonna do?\n\nDiseases spread by the homeless include tuberculosis, hepatitis, typhus, shigellosis, trench fever, skin infections, and potentially even bubonic plague.\n\nWhen supermarkets stop having food bars, and then when all the food is displayed in locked Plexiglas cases, we will know why.\n\nIn the meantime, the tainted food supposedly gets tossed (although apparently not right away). Law-abiding normal people pick up the tab through higher prices.\n\nAnother word for liberal rule is anarchotyranny. If you try to make an honest dollar, Big Government will break your kneecaps and empty your wallet. But if you are a hooligan or drug-addled bum, you are welcome to behave however you please.\n\nA few postcards from New York under the rule of social justice warriors like Bill de Blasio:\n\nDon\u2019t let this happen to your town. Vote for whichever candidate is the least liberal.\n\nOn tips from Sean C, Frances J, and Stormfax.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Dave Blount"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 12:00:02 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.moonbattery.com/graphics2/moonbattery_icon.ico", "meta_data": {"og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Avoid the Hot Food Bar in Cities Run by Moonbats - Moonbattery", "description": "In cities run by moonbats, supermarkets are not only convenient places to crap on the floor; they provide excellent opportunities to chow down on free food.
