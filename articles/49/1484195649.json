The company\u2019s flotation will be a key event in this coming year\u2019s technology exit market. Expect the NYSE and Nasdaq to compete for the listing, bankers to queue to take part, and endless media coverage.\n\nGiven that that\u2019s ahead, we\u2019re going to take periodic looks at Airbnb as we tick closer to its eventual public market debut. And that means that this morning we\u2019re looking back through time to see how fast the company has grown by using a quirky data point.\n\nAirbnb releases a regular tally of its expected \u201cguest stays\u201d for New Year\u2019s Eve each year, including 2019. We can therefore look back in time, tracking how quickly (or not) Airbnb\u2019s New Year Eve guest tally has risen. This exercise will provide a loose, but fun proxy for the company\u2019s growth as a whole.\n\nThe numbers\n\nBefore we look into the figures themselves, keep in mind that we are looking at a guest figure which is at best a proxy for revenue. We don\u2019t know the revenue mix of the guest stays, for example, meaning that Airbnb could have seen a 10% drop in per-guest revenue this New Year\u2019s Eve \u2014 even with more guest stays \u2014 and we\u2019d have no idea.\n\nSo, the cliche about grains of salt and taking, please.\n\nBut as more guests tends to mean more rentals which points towards more revenue, the New Year\u2019s Eve figures are useful as we work to understand how quickly Airbnb is growing now compared to how fast it grew in the past. The faster the company is expanding today, the more it\u2019s worth. And given recent news that the company has ditched profitability in favor of boosting its sales and marketing spend (leading to sharp, regular deficits in its quarterly results), how fast Airbnb can grow through higher spend is a key question for the highly-backed, San Francisco-based private company.\n\nHere\u2019s the tally of guest stays in Airbnb\u2019s during New Years Eve (data via CNBC, Jon Erlichman, Airbnb), and their resulting year-over-year growth rates:\n\n2009: 1,400\n\n2010: 6,000 (+329%)\n\n2011: 3,1000 (+417%)\n\n2012: 108,000 (248%)\n\n2013: 250,000 (+131%)\n\n2014: 540,000 (+116%)\n\n2015: 1,100,000 (+104%)\n\n2016: 2,000,000 (+82%)\n\n2017: 3,000,000 (+50%)\n\n2018: 3,700,000 (+23%)\n\n2019: 4,500,000 (+22%)\n\nIn chart form, that looks like this:\n\nLet\u2019s talk about a few things that stand out. First is that the company\u2019s growth rate managed to stay over 100% for as long as it did. In case you\u2019re a SaaS fan, what Airbnb pulled off in its early years (again, using this fun proxy for revenue growth) was far better than a triple-triple-double-double-double.\n\nNext, the company\u2019s growth rate in percentage terms has slowed dramatically, including in 2019. At the same time the firm managed to re-accelerate its gross guest growth in 2019. In numerical terms, Airbnb added 1,000,000 New Year\u2019s Eve guest stays in 2017, 700,000 in 2018, and 800,000 in 2019. So 2019\u2019s gross adds was not a record, but it was a better result than its year-ago tally.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Hello and welcome back to our regular morning look at private companies, public markets and the gray space in between.
