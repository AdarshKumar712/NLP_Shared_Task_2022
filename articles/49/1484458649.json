skate on the Eramosa River might soon go underwater.\n\nThe family has been going to Grandma\u2019s house, gathering friends and neighbours in Rockwood, and heading down to the water for a big game of hockey for over four decades.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just become the one day of the year when we all come and get together,\u201d said Liz Hudson. \u201cI always said if Mom ever sold the house people would still show up on New Year\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\nFormer Rockwood resident Frazer Nagy says an old dam that used to operate nearby created the perfect sheet of ice, but that frozen water has been put in jeopardy in recent years.\n\n\u201cIn the last four years we\u2019ve only been able to go out on the ice once,\u201d he said. \u201cIn several other years we were playing with a patch of open water not too far away.\u201d\n\nFor the 2020 get together, the Hudson\u2019s settling for a frozen parking lot as their rink.\n\nNagy adds that it\u2019s eye opening to see how climate change has hit home.\n\n\u201cThe get together has really brought us together for generations, I grew up learning how to skate here,\u201d he said. \u201cI am very fearful for my children who may never be able to play in the same way I did.\u201d\n\nDespite the thin ice, the Rockwood community and Hudson family say they\u2019re dedicated to keeping the New Year\u2019s Day tradition going.\n\n\u201cThis has been going on for most of my Mom\u2019s life,\u201d said Sofia Hudson. \u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["kitchener", "Waterloo", "Cambridge", "Guelph", "news",
