Shaq Barrett's three sacks, which gave him 19.5 on the year. That broke a tie with Hall of Famer Warren Sapp for Tampa Bay's single-season record, and beat Arizona's Chandler Jones by half a sack for the best mark in the NFL.\n\nBarrett signed a one-year, $4-millon deal with the Bucs last offseason, making him an unrestricted free agent after this season. He'll obviously be in high demand, and would make a killing were he to hit the open market.\n\nThe Bucs could keep him via the franchise tag, but both sides would prefer to see him return on a long-term deal.\n\nAfter Sunday's game, Barrett talked about breaking the franchise record, and why he feels he has unfinished business with his brothers in the Tampa Bay locker room.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "After bagging 19.5 sacks on a one-year deal, the NFL's sack leader wants to return to Tampa Bay.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 1758170921167225, "app_id": 2109571519347496}, "og": {"site_name": "Maven", "locale": "en_US", "title": "NFL Sack King Shaq Barrett Has Unfinished Business with Bucs", "description": "After bagging 19.5 sacks on a one-year deal, the NFL's sack leader wants to return to Tampa Bay.", "url": "https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/nfl-bucs-shaq-barrett-sack-record", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/MTY5NDI1NDkyMDkxMzQ4MjU3/shaq-week-17.jpg", "height": 720, "width": 1280}}, "build": {"key": "SS-WS2520-JOB1-243", "date": "2019-12-30 18:43:36 +0000"}, "twitter": {"title": "NFL Sack King Shaq Barrett Has Unfinished Business with Bucs", "description": "After bagging 19.5 sacks on a one-year deal, the NFL's sack leader wants to return to Tampa Bay.", "card": "summary", "image": "https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/MTY5NDI1NDkyMDkxMzQ4MjU3/shaq-week-17.jpg"}, "description": "After bagging 19.5 sacks on a one-year deal, the NFL's sack leader wants to return to Tampa Bay.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/nfl-bucs-shaq-barrett-sack-record"}
