Another vehicle, believed to be a white Cadillac Seville, hit him again. The Cadillac also fled the scene.\n\nAs one driver stopped to try to help Muhammad, another vehicle, believed to be a white or gray Ford Focus, hit Muhammad again. He became lodged beneath the car, which dragged his body for almost a mile before the driver stopped at a gas station on the corner of Adams and Crenshaw boulevards, according to police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter pulling up to the gas pumps, the driver got out of her car to see what was under her vehicle, according to police. She then got back into her car and backed up, which dislodged Muhammad from beneath her car.\n\nHer passenger got out of the car and looked at Muhammad lying in front of the vehicle. The passenger got back into car, and they drove away. Muhammad was pronounced dead at the scene by the Los Angeles Fire Department.\n\nAt a Monday news conference about traffic safety and accident statistics, LAPD officials announced that Yolanda Thompson, 57, of Los Angeles, was arrested about noon Dec. 16 after she turned herself in.\n\nAuthorities declined to provide any further details about Thompson\u2019s arrest, including which car she was driving, citing the active investigation into the identities of the two other drivers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLAPD Det. Ryan Moreno told KTLA-TV Channel 5 that Muhammad was homeless, and was well known and liked in the neighborhood.\n\nAs part of the city\u2019s hit-and-run reward program trust fund, a reward of up to $50,000 is available to community members who provide information leading to the offender\u2019s identification, apprehension and conviction, or resolution through a civil compromise.\n\nLAPD Chief Michel Moore warned at Monday\u2019s news conference that a motorist should never flee the scene of an accident.\n\n\u201cThe key for hit-and-runs for me is this: It\u2019s an accident, don\u2019t make it a crime,\u201d Moore said. \"``Many times when we see collisions involving pedestrians or other motorists that turn into a hit-and-run, the person who\u2019s actually at fault may not be the person who flees the scene. And yet that person who flees the scene is now committing a felony.\u201d\n\nCity News Service contributed to this report.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Things to Do"], "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Jaclyn Cosgrove Is A Metro Reporter At The Los Angeles Times.
