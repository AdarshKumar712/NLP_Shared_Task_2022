We all know how it\u2019s going to end. There is no chance the president is going to be removed from office.\u201d\n\nMcConnell is also pushing back on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s demands.\n\nSusan Collins wasn\u2019t happy about McConnell\u2019s defense of the President after the Dem-controlled House railroaded him and denied him due process.\n\nSusan Collins is the second GOP Senator to criticize McConnell.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard the Senate majority leader saying that he\u2019s taking his cues from the White House,\u201d Collins said this week in an interview with Maine Public Radio. \u201cThere are senators on both sides of the aisle, who, to me, are not giving the appearance of and the reality of judging this in an impartial way.\u201d\n\nCollins\u2019 criticism of McConnell comes shortly after Murkowski called the Senate Majority Leader\u2019s statements \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in fairness, when I heard that I was disturbed,\u201d Murkowski said last week. \u201cTo me it means that we have to take that step back from being hand in glove with the defense, and so when I heard what Leader McConnell has said, I happened to think that further confused the process.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats denied Trump due process, denied him legal counsel and denied his 6th Amendment right to face his accuser, in this case, Eric Ciaramella, the \u2018whistleblower\u2019 who coordinated with Schiff to launch the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi continued her reign of tyranny and refused to deliver the articles of impeachment to the Senate unless they bow to her demands.\n\nThe Constitution is absolutely clear about the Senate\u2019s authority. Article I, Section 3 says: \u201cThe Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments,\u201d Breitbart\u2019s Joel Pollak wrote.\n\nthegatewaypundit.com/2020/01/rino-senator-susan-collins-joins-murkowski-and-criticizes-mcconnells-promise-to-coordinate-impeachment-trial-with-white-house/", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.teaparty.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Favicon-Tea-Party.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "google-site-verification": "BUmroTlpSK6UfDeL-RF65T8u9-kL5ZhBtj6sufpwNGY"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.teaparty.org/rino-senator-susan-collins-joins-murkowski-and-criticizes-mcconnells-promise-to-coordinate-impeachment-trial-with-white-house-423047/"}
