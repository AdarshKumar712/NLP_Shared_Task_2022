26.90.\n\nSWIMMING\n\nJuniors still hold the fort for Uganda swimming with now over 600 swimmers engaged in the sport at different levels.\n\nDolphins Club and national swimmer Kirabo Namutebi, 14, in particular, continued to prove how far she has come and grown with the sport by again shining out locally and internationally.\n\nShe received plaudits from the swimming fraternity and many other Ugandans following her superb performance at the 7th FINA World Swimming Championship that was held in Hungary, in August.\n\nThe 14-year-old British School of Uganda, Dolphins Swim Club, and national swimmer did not only achieve personal bests in all her races but set a new national record when she clocked 26.98 in the 50m freestyle race.\n\nShe bettered Jamila Lunkuse\u2019s 27.43 set in 2014 over the same distance by 1.45 seconds as she became Uganda\u2019s first swimmer in recent times to win a heat at the World Championships.\n\nDespite her time being 2.27 second shy of USA\u2019s Warsh Gretchen who won gold over the distance, Namutebi beat nine other swimmers from different countries in her heat and finished 38th overall out of 102 swimmers who swam that race.\n\nShe also registered personal bests in the 50m fly, 100m freestyle, 50m butterfly and 50m breaststroke races.\n\nShe had earlier claimed 2gold and 1silver and 2bronze in the CANA Zone IV championship in Namibia in

That earned her the Real Stars Monthly Sports Award and only lost out on the USPA monthly award to athlete Halima Nakayi who had also grabbed gold in the 800m race at the World Athletics Championship.\n\nHer brother Tendo Mukalazi also shattered the national 50m breaststroke national record at the FINA Junior World Championships in Korea. Tendo made 32.64 and 29.70 in the 50m breast and backstroke races, which were all personal bests. Atuhaire Ambala, Selina Katumba and Avice Meya were the other members on the team.\n\nAnother international outing was made by Darren Ssamula and Adnan Kabuye who together with Kirabo made their debut at the worlds in Budapest, Hungary, in August.\n\nAt the CANA Zone 3 Swimming Championship held at the Kasarani Aquatic Center in Nairobi, Namutebi was once again unstoppable in the 13-14 years category that she led with 174 points ahead of Kenya\u2019s Islam Lubaina (140pts) and South Africa\u2019s Adams Keesha (131pts).\n\nKirabo picked 6 gold and 3 silver and was instrumental in a number of relay races as Ugandan won 53 individual medals overall (14gold, 29sliver,10bronze).\n\nThe girls finished third overall on 851 points behind Tanzania and Kenya who won the category with 1,180 points.\n\nEarlier during the annual Independence Swimming Gala Kirabo won 11 individual gold medals and broke all meet records in her category on top of setting a new 50m freestyle record of 26.90.\n\nKirabo, who was USPA swimmer of the year in 2013 and 2016, looks to add another award from her 2019 performance.\n\nThe Dolphins Swim Club missed her as they competed in the KSF Long Course Nationals 2019 at the Kenya Swimming Federation Age Group Swimming Championships in Nairobi, in February but they would collect a total of 42 medals (8gold, 18silver and 16bronze) to finish second for the first time in five years.\n\nThe Coach Paul Bampata led team produced some golden performances in the three-day event with Pendo Kaumi, Jordan Ssamula, Tendo Kaumi picking gold in the 200m freestyle, 400IM and in the 100m backstroke races, in a time of 2:36.97, 6:45.30 and 1:17.38 respectively in some of the races.\n\nThe other Uganda club the Seals was also on top of their game topping the girls\u2019 category on 862 points ahead of Bandari and Loreto teams but finishing third overall.\n\nIt was also a first for most of the Seals but the likes of Amelia Mudanye, Alexis Kituuka, Mpeera Yalonda, Neema Kangi, Anthea Mudanye, Natalie Lutalo, and John Kafumbe gave a good account of themselves with some golden performances.\n\nClubs also continued to develop the sport through the different club events like the Seals League Meets and Invitational, the Dolphins Fast and Furious as well as the Silverfin Pentathlon.\n\nThe Dolphins Swim Club swimmers proved dominant throughout the year in the Seals League meets that were held at the Kampala Parents School pool.\n\nBut the\n\nThe Dolphins topped six of the ten categories with the Seals only getting a top spot in only the boys\u2019 13-14, the girls\u2019 9-10 and 13-14 years categories where John Kafumbe, Mpeera Yalonda, Neema Kangi and Amelia Mudanye won.\n\nDolphins\u2019 Adnan Kabuye, Ethan Ssengooba, Daniel Nuwagaba, Ssango Kiggundu, Michelle Sine and Shalom Birungi topped the other age categories.\n\nThe Uganda Swimming Federation (USF) also organised two sprint galas in the year where juniors continued to test their speed in the different races.\n\nIn the second sprints gala Seals\u2019 Amelia Mudanye\u2019s time of 1: 23.33 in the 100IM, in the girls 10&Under category remained intact with the winner of the category Kampala Aquatics\u2019 Rahmah Nakasule, managing 1: 28.03.
