However, the power struggle in the AfD is unlikely to end. EURACTIV Germany reports.\n\nThe party announced Friday evening (15 May) that the party leadership had voted by a narrow margin of 7-5 with one abstention, to cancel Kalbitz\u2019 membership in the party \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d after AfD chairman J\u00f6rg Meuthen had brought the vote on Kalbitz.\n\nThe Brandenburg AfD leader is accused of having concealed his former membership in the right-wing extremist and now banned association \u201cHeimattreue Deutsche Jugend\u201d (German Youth True to Home) when he joined the party.\n\nThe AfD is deeply divided over the decision. The leader of the AfD parliamentary group in the Berlin House of Representatives, Georg Pazderski, called Kalbitz\u2019 exclusion from the party \u201ca clear sign that we take the fight against right-wing extremist ideas in our own ranks very seriously.\u201d\n\nHowever, AfD deputy leader Stephan Brandner called via Twitter for a federal party conference to be convened soon, at which all board members should explain the reasons for their decision and declared that he had voted to keep Kalbitz in the party.\n\nAnti-lockdown protests in Germany infiltrated by far-right extremists Many people are looking for explanations since lockdown measures were introduced to contain the coronavirus outbreak. In Germany, right-wing extremists are trying to take advantage of this. EURACTIV Germany reports.\n\nKalbitz one of the leaders of the \u2018Wing\u2019\n\nIn mid-March, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), together with the Thuringian AfD chairman Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, had described Kalbitz as the \u201cright-wing extremist main protagonist\u201d of the AfD sub-organisation \u2018Der Fl\u00fcgel,\u2019 known as the \u2018Wing\u2019.\n\nThe BfV also classified the sub-organisation as a \u201cproven right-wing extremist endeavour.\u201d The party leadership then asked the group to dissolve itself by the end of April. While the dissolution, which was staged primarily on social networks, is considered officially complete, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution has come to a different conclusion.\n\n\u201cA de facto dissolution of Wing structures or inactivation of the organisation has not yet been ascertained,\u201d the State Office for the Constitution in Saxony told EURACTIV Germany. Brandenburg\u2019s interior and municipal affairs ministry has also spoken of a \u201csham dissolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe members of the AfD, who are committed to the \u2018wing\u2019, continue to be active in the federal party,\u201d a spokesperson for the ministry told EURACTIV Germany. H\u00f6cke and Kalbitz, in particular, would continue to exert considerable influence on the course of the party, it was said before the federal executive board meeting of the AfD.\n\nAfD threatens further division\n\nKalbitz will have to give up his office as the state leader in Brandenburg after the party leadership\u2019s decision. However, the Secretary-General of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Brandenburg, Erik Stohn, doubts that excluding Kalbitz will change anything about the political orientation of the AfD in Brandenburg.\n\n\u201cThe AfD-Brandenburg is a party \u2018framed\u2019 by Mr Kalbitz,\u201d he told EURACTIV Germany. Even without Kalbitz, it is at the centre of the extreme-right spectrum. This assessment is shared by the Brandenburg Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which describes the state association as \u201chaving evaporated through and through\u201d.\n\nKalbitz has announced that he intends to legally challenge the decision of the party leadership at federal level. He denies former membership of the \u201cHeimattreue Deutsche Jugend\u201d (German Youth True to Home).\n\nHe is also backed by the chairman of the AfD parliamentary group, Alexander Gauland, who had told media representatives that the decision was \u201cwrong and dangerous for the party.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon May 18 10:53:11 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The leadership of the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party on Friday (15 May), expelled Brandenburg's AfD leader Andreas Kalbitz after Kalbitz was classified as a right-wing extremist by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution in early March.
