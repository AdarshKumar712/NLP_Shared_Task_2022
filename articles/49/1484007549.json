It has caused a decline in the standard of living as well as unprecedented levels of unemployment and unrelenting poverty.\n\nFigures show that 85 percent of Gazans are currently living under the poverty line, according to Khudari. Israel has also launched three major wars against the enclave since 2008, killing thousands of Gazans each time and shattering the impoverished territory\u2019s already poor infrastructure.\n\nElsewhere in his statement, Khudari stressed that \u201cthe blockade is immoral and inhuman, and contradicts all principles of international law, the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\u201d\n\nThe economic situation across Palestinian lands worsened earlier this year after the US cut all its financial aid for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.\n\nThe cuts in the humanitarian aid were soon hitting hundreds of thousands of the most vulnerable people, especially in Gaza, where 80 percent are dependent on aid.\n\nSince March 30 last year, the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip have been holding the \u201cGreat March of Return\u201d rallies, demanding the right to return for those driven out of their homeland by Israeli aggression since 1967.\n\nIsraeli troops have killed nearly 310 Palestinians since the beginning of the rallies and wounded more than 18,000 others, according to the Gazan Health Ministry.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://english.pnn.ps/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Palestinian NGO appeals to UN chief to pressure Israel to lift blockade of Gaza - PNN", "type": "article", "description": "Gaza /PNN/ A Palestinian anti-siege group has appealed to the United Nations Secretary-General Anton", "url": "http://english.pnn.ps/2019/12/31/palestinian-ngo-appeals-to-un-chief-to-pressure-israel-to-lift-blockade-of-gaza/", "site_name": "PNN", "image": "http://english.pnn.ps/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gazab-660x330.jpg"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 1.0.2", "viewport": "width=1045"}, "canonical_link": "http://english.pnn.ps/2019/12/31/palestinian-ngo-appeals-to-un-chief-to-pressure-israel-to-lift-blockade-of-gaza/"}
