Everyone was outraged and sick about it. By that time, the rock had been cleaned and there was great relief,\u201d Filson said.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation reported the incident to the Plymouth Police Department, State Police and the Massachusetts Environmental Police (MEP) and then power washed the graffiti off of Plymouth Rock and the National Monument to the Forefathers, a DCR spokesman said.\n\nThe graffiti included the numbers 508 and the letters MOF.\n\nThe department was working on Monday afternoon to remove the remainder of the graffiti from the amphitheater, Filson said, and if power washing doesn\u2019t remove it all, DCR will explore other options to remove the paint.\n\nPlymouth Rock is traditionally believed to be the site of disembarkation of William Bradford and the Mayflower Pilgrims who founded Plymouth Colony in December 1620.\n\n\u201cAs Plymouth commemorates the 400th anniversary of the landing of the Mayflower this year, we have already begun welcoming international and domestic visitors,\u201d Filson said. \u201cThe waterfront and the historic district are safe, well-lit and will continue to welcome all who visit.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Plymouth"], "authors": ["Marie Szaniszlo"], "publish_date": "Mon Feb 17 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Police are investigating vandalism that outraged visitors on Monday to Plymouth Rock and other historic sites on the waterfront at Pilgrim Memorial State Park.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HeraldIcon.jpg?w=32", "meta_data": {"application-name": "bostonherald", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "description": "Police are investigating vandalism that outraged visitors on Monday to Plymouth Rock and other historic sites on the waterfront at Pilgrim Memorial State Park.", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "wp-parsely_version": "1.14", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Plymouth Rock hit with graffiti", "url": "https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/02/17/plymouth-rock-hit-with-graffiti/", "description": "Police are investigating vandalism that outraged visitors on Monday to Plymouth Rock and other historic sites on the waterfront at Pilgrim Memorial State Park.", "site_name": "Boston Herald", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/plymouthms001.jpg?w=1024&h=671", "width": 1024, "height": 671}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered", "published_time": "2020-02-18T00:17:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-18T14:17:42+00:00"}, "fb": {"pages": 197211981599}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Plymouth Rock hit with graffiti"}, "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/plymouthms001.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HeraldIcon.jpg?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/02/17/plymouth-rock-hit-with-graffiti/"}
