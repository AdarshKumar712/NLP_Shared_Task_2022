Fan attendance is relatively low, and in Europe in particular the tournament receives little enthusiasm\u2014or even attention.\n\nBut this year\u2019s event, which saw England\u2019s Liverpool team take the top prize earlier this month, was significant for an entirely different reason: It was hosted by Qatar. The tournament was in effect a dry run for how the small Arab Gulf nation will manage the FIFA World Cup, by far the globe\u2019s most popular sporting event, in 2022.\n\nBottoms up?\n\nOne lingering question is how the conservative country will handle the availability and affordability of alcohol, something that is widely considered a central part of soccer fan culture. It\u2019s also a concern that Qatari officials have sought to allay repeatedly.\n\nThough alcohol was banned at stadiums at this month\u2019s Club World Cup\u2014a departure from tournaments elsewhere\u2014an outdoor fan zone was set up with reduced beer prices of $6 a pint. That\u2019s more affordable than the $13 typically charged for beer at the 40 or so hotels that serve alcohol in Qatar.\n\nBut there was a catch: The outdoor drinking area was at a golf course about an hour from the final match. Spectators were reportedly bussed between the Khalifa stadium and the fan zone. The toilet-less ride pushed some to publicly urinate on walls outside the fan zone, with authorities turning a blind eye\u2014a sign of how they might deal with boisterous fans in 2022.\n\nWorld Cup organizers say serving beer at stadiums is not entirely off the agenda.\n\nA good night\u2019s rest\n\nAnother crucial question is just where the many fans expected to turn up for the tournament will sleep. There are fewer than 40,000 hotel rooms in Qatar, and organizers are planning to have a capacity of 70,000 rooms ahead of the tournament. More than 1 million people are expected to arrive for the month-long sporting event.\n\nLodging concerns have already pushed Qatari officials to approach organizers of Glastonbury\u2014the famous British music festival\u2014to consider building desert tents to accommodate visitors. The government has also signed deals with luxury cruise liners that might sleep up to 40,000 people over the course of the tournament. Officials have previously expressed concerns that those could turn into \u201cbooze cruises,\u201d particularly if England\u2019s team qualifies.\n\nInfrastructure for all\n\nQatar is building seven new stadiums ahead of the 2022 tournament, each with a capacity of tens of thousands of people. The World Cup will for the first time be held in the winter months, to avoid summer temperatures that can reach 50\u00b0C (122\u00b0F), and stadiums will be equipped with outdoor cooling facilities to counter highs in the 20s\u00b0C. Roads and infrastructure connecting the stadiums are also being built, including Doha\u2019s first subway system, unveiled in May.\n\nMigrant workers\u2019 rights\n\nQatar has been criticized for its human rights record since winning the bid to host the FIFA World Cup. Hundreds of migrants, who make up about 90% of the country\u2019s population, have died constructing the massive infrastructure projects for the games. But the deaths\u2014the state confirms only three\u2014and the bad publicity from them has also pushed Qatar to reform its labor laws.\n\nThe country is abolishing the kafala sponsorship system, in place across the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, which prohibits workers from switching jobs or leaving the country without their employer\u2019s approval. Qatar is also strengthening worker protection rights, and has passed a new minimum-wage law.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nIn the end, Qatar looks set to accommodate the expectations of World Cup-goers to some degree. But the tournament, which in the past led to even Russian bars running low on beer, is likely to be a less rowdy affair in 2022. And it will come with a hefty $200 billion price tag for Doha\u2014dwarfing the $11.6 billion that host Russia spent in 2018.\n\nWhether the cost\u2014financial and otherwise\u2014is worthwhile remains to be seen.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Adam Rasmi"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Booze, accommodations, and more are some things the Arab Gulf nation is grappling with.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/public/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "description": "Booze, accommodations, and more are some things the Arab Gulf nation is grappling with.", "image": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/RTS2V8CH-e1577730044412.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1400", "title": "Soccer fans still worry the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be a major buzzkill", "type": "article", "url": "https://qz.com/1777344/will-qatar-be-ready-to-host-the-world-cup-in-2022/", "site_name": "Quartz"}, "application-name": "Quartz", "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Quartz", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "Global business news and insights", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/quartz-icon.jpg?w=144&h=144&crop=1&strip=all&quality=75", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/quartz-icon.jpg?w=70&h=70&crop=1&strip=all&quality=75", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/quartz-icon.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1&strip=all&quality=75", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/quartz-icon.jpg?w=310&h=150&crop=1&strip=all&quality=75", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/quartz-icon.jpg?w=310&h=310&crop=1&strip=all&quality=75", "google-site-verification": "s3UlsLX3rTzf6Zh3P-bFlB0KcMuM1gKAPYrMm5icDK8", "news_keywords": "FIFA Club World Cup,beer availability,2022 qatar world cup,qatar,FIFA,Edited by Kira Bindrim", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/quartznews"}, "author": "Adam Rasmi", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@adamrasmi?lang=en", "image": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/RTS2V8CH-e1577730044412.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1400", "site": "@qz", "url": "https://qz.com/1777344/will-qatar-be-ready-to-host-the-world-cup-in-2022/"}, "description": "Booze, accommodations, and more are some things the Arab Gulf nation is grappling with."}, "canonical_link": "https://qz.com/1777344/will-qatar-be-ready-to-host-the-world-cup-in-2022/"}
