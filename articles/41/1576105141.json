Before her tragic death in 1997 she\u2019d certainly been both those things but when she first started dating Charles, Prince of Wales, the then-Lady Diana Spencer hadn\u2019t been used to having her every move photographed. Ahead, check out rare photos of Diana taken at a time when the world wanted to know more about the future king\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nPrincess Diana first met Prince Charles when he\u2019d been dating her sister\n\nBefore they began dating in 1980, a 16-year-old Diana met Charles when he came to the Spencer family home, Althorp, for a visit in 1977. At the time he\u2019d been seeing Diana\u2019s sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale.\n\nPrince Charles and Lady Sarah McCorquodale | Tim Graham Photo Library\n\nAccording to tape recordings of Diana done for Andrew Morton\u2019s biography, Diana: Her True Story \u2013 In Her Own Words, the future Princess of Wales wasn\u2019t very impressed with Charles when she first met him.\n\nHere\u2019s how Diana described her first impression of Charles:\n\n\u201cSo I remember him coming to Althorp to stay, my husband, and the first impact was \u2018God, what a sad man.\u2019 He came with his Labrador [Harvey]. My sister was all over him like a bad rash and I thought: \u2018God he must really hate that.\u2019 I kept out of the way.\u201d\n\nA short time later Diana described Charles as \u201ccharm himself\u201d telling others she\u2019d been \u201csort of amazed\u201d by him. They began dating in 1980 and when the press learned of the romance, photographers and reporters began waiting for Diana outside of her apartment, her work, and everywhere else she went. Below, see Diana in the apartment she lived in when she and Charles were dating.\n\nPrincess Diana | Kypros/Getty Images\n\nClearly, Diana wasn\u2019t used to being hounded by the press day and night.\n\nShe attended Princess Margaret\u2019s birthday party\n\nTalk about wanting to be a fly on the wall. A young Diana got a spot on the guest list at Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowden\u2019s 50th birthday party.

As she walked through London\u2019s Kensington neighborhood, photographers took her pictures while kids reportedly chanted \u201cPrince Charles\u2019 girlfriend.\u201d\n\nPrincess Diana | Bettmann\n\nMedia attention increased right before Prince Charles and Princess Diana announced their engagement\n\nShortly before Charles and Diana went public with the news of their engagement on Feb. 24, 1981, the media\u2019s interest in Diana intensified.\n\nSurrounded by photographers, a young Diana spoke to a reporter while walking down the street.\n\nPrincess Diana | Ian Tyas/Getty Images\n\nHere she is again in her new car outside her apartment days before her engagement to Charles had been announced. Getting used to her new ride, she stalled her car and photographers were there to capture the moment.\n\nPrincess Diana | Tom Stoddart/Getty Images\n\nDiana and Charles reportedly went on 12 dates before getting engaged. They didn\u2019t spend much time together one-one-one but they have outings on Charles\u2019 family\u2019s yacht and traveled to Balmoral, a vacation home in Scotland.\n\nJudging from the pictures of Diana taken when she and Charles were dating, she came a long way from her days of being called \u201cShy Di\u201d by reporters. While she had a strange relationship with the press, Diana knew how to harness her star power to focus on causes important to her.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Trending"], "authors": ["Mandi Kerr"], "publish_date": "Sat Apr 11 20:16:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Princess Diana, then known as Lady Diana Spencer, looks uncomfortable with media attention in early photos taken of her when she and Prince Charles were dating.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico?x62514", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/princess-diana-5-rare-photos-of-princess-of-wales-when-she-and-prince-charles-were-dating.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "Princess Diana, then known as Lady Diana Spencer, looks uncomfortable with media attention in early photos taken of her when she and Prince Charles were dating.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Princess Diana: 5 Rare Photos of the Princess of Wales When She and Prince Charles Were Dating", "description": "Princess Diana, then known as Lady Diana Spencer, looks uncomfortable with media attention in early photos taken of her when she and Prince Charles were dating.", "url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/princess-diana-5-rare-photos-of-princess-of-wales-when-she-and-prince-charles-were-dating.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Prince-Charles-and-Lady-Sarah-Spencer-640x436.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Prince-Charles-and-Lady-Sarah-Spencer-640x436.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ShowbizCheatsheet", "tag": "Princess Diana", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2020-04-11T20:16:00-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Princess Diana, then known as Lady Diana Spencer, looks uncomfortable with media attention in early photos taken of her when she and Prince Charles were dating.", "title": "Princess Diana: 5 Rare Photos of the Princess of Wales When She and Prince Charles Were Dating", "site": "@cheatsheet", "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Prince-Charles-and-Lady-Sarah-Spencer-640x436.jpg", "creator": "@cheatsheet"}, "fb": {"admins": 826582091}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "position": 2}, "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/princess-diana-5-rare-photos-of-princess-of-wales-when-she-and-prince-charles-were-dating.html/"}
