It will cut China\u2019s banks\u2019 reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 50 basis points, to 12.5%, from 6 January.\n\nThe move means lenders can lend more of their savers\u2019 funds to borrowers to support the economy, rather than keeping it on hand.\n\nThe RRR was cut three times during 2019 as Beijing tried to protect companies from the damage caused by the US-China trade war. Despite these efforts, growth hit a 30-year low in 2019, with manufacturing activity shrinking for much of the year.\n\nThe PBoC said this latest cut was meant to \u201cfurther support the development of the real economy and lower real financing costs\u201d.\n\nSign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nThe lower RRR could also prevent financial conditions tightening in the run-up to the lunar new year this month, when firms and families need cash on hand.\n\nIn a new year message, the PBoC governor, Yi Gang, said the central bank had taken \u201cresolute and strong actions\u201d in 2019, to combat predictable and unpredictable events.\n\n\u201cFacing potential \u2018black swan\u2019 and \u2018grey rhino\u2019 incidents in the financial market, we had the resolution, confidence and ability to win the battle of forestalling and defusing major financial risks,\u201d Yi declared.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["China", "Economics", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Graeme Wearden"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "People\u2019s Bank of China allows commercial banks to hold less capital in reserve", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/fee5e2d638d1c35f6d501fa397e53329/152x152.png", "meta_data": {"description": "People\u2019s Bank of China allows commercial banks to hold less capital in reserve", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Graeme Wearden", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/707370c7bf57fb035895a9d54ada67c2f7435acb/29_298_3932_2360/master/3932.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7181b7a7a7318437e0e1f45bc75a752a", "keywords": "China,Economics,Business,Asia Pacific", "news_keywords": "China,Economics,Business,Asia Pacific", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/01/money-pumped-into-china-economy-in-attempt-to-fight-slowdown", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/707370c7bf57fb035895a9d54ada67c2f7435acb/29_298_3932_2360/master/3932.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=61c5b00ed62b2d17433024984871d873", "description": "People\u2019s Bank of China allows commercial banks to hold less capital in reserve", "type": "article", "title": "Money pumped into China's economy in attempt to fight slowdown", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/graemewearden", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "World news", "published_time": "2020-01-01T17:05:44.000Z", "tag": "China,Economics,Business,Asia Pacific", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T17:08:45.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/01/money-pumped-into-china-economy-in-attempt-to-fight-slowdown?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/01/money-pumped-into-china-economy-in-attempt-to-fight-slowdown?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/01/money-pumped-into-china-economy-in-attempt-to-fight-slowdown", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/01/money-pumped-into-china-economy-in-attempt-to-fight-slowdown?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/707370c7bf57fb035895a9d54ada67c2f7435acb/29_298_3932_2360/master/3932.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=02ca9a468ae3d3c1b9aa666d4e803cf1", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/01/money-pumped-into-china-economy-in-attempt-to-fight-slowdown"}
