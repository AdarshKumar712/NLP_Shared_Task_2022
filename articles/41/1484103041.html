Alicia Saucier.</p>  <p>Officials at CFB North Bay were less enthusiastic. On July 21, 2016, they filed a complaint with Niantic, the developer of Pokemon Go.</p>  <p>&quot;With the implementation of this PokeStop, there will be an increase in traffic onto the base, which could have a negative impact on 22 Wing&#x27;s Mission,&quot; the request said.</p>  <p>Niantic responded that it would review the complaint and follow up.</p>  <h2>Embracing Pokemon</h2>  <p>Meanwhile, at CFB Halifax, officials tried to harness the game for their benefit. An email to Rear Admiral John Newton made a series of recommendations: </p>  <ul>   <li>Remove the PokeStop from the Dockyard Gym, because &quot;it presents a security risk.&quot;</li>   <li>Add a PokeStop at the Stadacona Gym, because &quot;this addition, with the already existing PokeStops at the museum and the admiral&#x27;s residence, would increase the museum&#x27;s attendance.&quot;</li>   <li>If possible, upgrade the museum PokeStop to a Pokemon gym to increase traffic.</li>  </ul>  <p>Rear Admiral Newton addressed the Pokemon generally in an email, writing: &quot;Life and work are best accomplished if there is good fun, health and friendship.</p>  <p>&quot;If Pokemon Go enables these values, while we protect our interests, then we all stand to marvel at this intersection of technology, gaming and health.&quot;</p>  <h2>What took so long?</h2>  <p>It took more than three years for the Department of National Defence (DND) to provide the documents requested by CBC News.</p>  <p>According to legislation, the normal response time should be up to 60 days.</p>  <p>&quot;While our goal is to provide responses to Access to Information (ATI) requests as efficiently as possible, the review process is challenged by the size and complexity of the organization, as well as the number of requests received every year,&quot; said a statement from Jessica Lamirande, a senior communications adviser with DND. </p>  <p>&quot;Recognizing that backlog files require more attention, DND recently created a new team in the Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) Directorate as part of a Backlog Reduction Initiative. This team has been assigned the task of working solely on backlog files so that the other processing teams can concentrate on ensuring newer files do not go late,&quot; she said.</p>  <p>In other words, the orders given to government staff hired to identify overdue information requests seem to be, as Pokemon says, &quot;you gotta catch &#x27;em all.&quot;</p>  <div><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/pokemon-go-causing-crashes-regina-police-say-1.3698663" data-contentid="" class="similarLink"><span class="similarLinkText">Pokemon Go causing crashes, Regina police say </span></a></li></ul></span><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/pokemon-go-quebec-residents-1.3696745" data-contentid="" class="similarLink"><span class="similarLinkText">Quebec&#x27;s Pokemon Go players accused of late night noise and public urination</span></a></li></ul></span><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/pokemon-go-japan-thailand-1.3711529" data-contentid="" class="similarLink"><span class="similarLinkText">Pokemon No: Game nixed from Japanese memorial as Thailand outlines no-go zones</span></a></li></ul></span></div>  <p> </p></span></div></div><div class="authorprofile"><h2 class="headingText">About the Author</h2><div class="authorprofile-container"><div class="authorprofile-image-container"><figure class="imageMedia author-image full"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholderImage" style="padding-bottom:100%"></div><img alt="" srcSet="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3264695.1459883154!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_300/brett-ruskin.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3264695.1459883154!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_460/brett-ruskin.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3264695.1459883154!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_620/brett-ruskin.jpg 620w" sizes="258px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3264695.1459883154!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_620/brett-ruskin.jpg"/></div></figure></div><div class="authorprofile-name-container"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/brett-ruskin-1.3264553">Brett Ruskin</a><p class="authorprofile-title">Reporter/Videojournalist</p></div></div><p class="authorprofile-biography">Brett Ruskin is a reporter and videojournalist covering everything from local breaking news to national issues.
