While 93 passenger trains were delayed due to fog on Tuesday, several mail and express trains were running late by four to five hours on Wednesday.According to an ECR official, at least 30 passenger trains reaching the Danapur division were delayed on Tuesday followed by 33 in Mughalsarai, 20 in Sonepur, 6 in Dhanbad and 4 in Samastipur division. \u201cThe dense fog prevailing in the entire northern region on the New Delhi-Kanpur-Allahabad-Pt Deendayal Upadhaya Junction-Patna Junction route was badly affected,\u201d the official said, adding that the stretch between Tundala and Allahabad was the bottleneck causing slow traffic movement due to poor visibility on tracks.Danapur railway official told this newspaper on Wednesday that New Delhi-Rajendra Nagar Terminal Rajdhani Express (12310) reached Patna Junction about 90 minutes late, while New Delhi-Patna Sampoorna Kranti Express (12392) was delayed by 210 minutes and New Delhi-Rajgir Shramjeevi Express (12394) by about 180 minutes on Wednesday.Similarly, the Yesvantpur-Patliputra Sanghamitra Express (22352) reached 180 minutes late while New Delhi-Islampur Magadh Express (20802) was delayed by 300 minutes and Surat-Bhagalpur Express (22947) by 60 minutes followed by Udhna-Danapur Express (19063) by 70 minutes and Brahmaputra Mail (15956) by 160 minutes. \u201cThe railways also cancelled Anand Vihar-Sealdah Expres (13120), Kumbha Express (12370) and Mokama-Howrah fast passenger (53050) trains on Wednesday,\u201d the Danapur official said.According to sources, long distance passenger trains were running at full caution speed of 60km per hour on the mainline section of Danapur division at night. Extra alertness is being maintained on bridges where night track patrolling is being carried out under the supervision of senior safety officers.\u201cLoco pilots have been directed not to take risk and follow winter safety measures on the Delhi-Kanpur-Allahabad route due to zero visibility on the tracks during night,\u201d sources said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Patna news", "Patna latest news", "Patna news live", "Patna news today", "Today news Patna", "railways", "Patna Junction railway station", "Magadh Express", "East Central Railway zone", "cancellation of bihar trains today", "cancellation of bihar trains"], "tags": ["Bangalore Temperature", "Delhi Smog", "Mumbai Rains", "Magadh Express", "railways", "Hyderabad Rain", "GHMC Elections 2020", "Chennai Weather", "Srinagar encounter", "Fire in Mumbai", "Delhi Temperature", "Delhi Air Pollution"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Foggy weather conditions continued to affect the movement of passenger trains in all the five divisions under East Central Railway (ECR).
