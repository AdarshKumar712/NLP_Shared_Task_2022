Neither man can be identified for legal reasons.\n\nIt has proved highly divisive in Australia, attracting protesters and supporters today to the High Court in Canberra, where they carried rival signs that read \u201cCriminal Pell: pedophile icon\u201d and \u201cWe love you, Cardinal George Pell and genuine victims.\u201d\n\nLocal media reported a Melbourne man was charged yesterday with threatening to kill Pell and making a bomb threat.\n\nPell has been removed from top Church bodies by the Vatican but remains in the priesthood.\n\nThe Vatican previously said it would avoid launching an investigation into his conduct until after all legal avenues are exhausted. \u2014 AFP", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["child sex abuse", "george pell", "australia appeal court", "judgment delayed"], "tags": ["COVID-19"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Mar 12 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "CANBERRA, March 12 \u2014 Australia's High Court today delayed judgment in Cardinal George Pell's appeal against child sex abuse convictions, with a decision now not expected for months.
