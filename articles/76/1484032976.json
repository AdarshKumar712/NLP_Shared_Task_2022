Kannan was booked by the police for making derogatory comments against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah on the passage of citizenship law.\n\nThe police action came after the Congress leader asked the minorities to finish-off PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah at a meeting arranged by Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in Tirunelveli on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI was expecting Saheebs to end Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. But no one is doing that,\u201d Kannan had said at the meeting.\n\nHe further said that Home Minister Amit Shah is controlling the PM.\n\nA day after Kannan\u2019s controversial speech, BJP national secretary H Raja urged Tamil Nadu police to arrest Kannan for derogatory comments against the PM and HM.\n\n\u201cThe Congress politician Nellai Kannan has instigated the Muslims to finish off PM and HM in his speech. I have complained to the Director General of Tamil Nadu Police, through WhatsApp and on online too. I request the TN Gov to take immediate action,\u201d H Raja said in a tweet.\n\nHe further said that Kannan has not only passed derogatory comments against Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Shah, but \u201cgave a life threat to them by instigating Muslims\u201d. \u201cIt seems Kannan wants to do something which happened for Rajiv Gandhi in Tamil Nadu,\u201d Raja said on Twitter.\n\nOn his complaint, the Tamil Nadu Police booked Kannan under IPC section 504, 505 and 505(2) for trying to instigate violence, instigating someone to indulge in violence, and creating violence between two groups.\n\nRaja further declared that four senior BJP workers would stage dharna if the police fails to arrest the Congress leader.\n\n\u201cI have tried to reach Nellai Kannan through his phone number. A voicemail speaks in Kannada says that the number is currently not reachable. I, BJP senior leader La Ganesan, former Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan and BJP leader CP Radhakrishnan will launch a dharna before Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s statue if the police does not arrest Kannan,\u201d said Raja.\n\nBJP workers have been protesting against Kannan in Tirunelveli. The 74-year-old leader was stopped by the BJP workers from going to hospital. As the private hospital reportedly denied him admission, Kannan headed to another hospital for health check-up.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Nellai Kannan", "Tamil scholar", "Narendra Modi", "Amit Shah", "Nellai Kannan speech"], "tags": ["Tirunelveli", "H.
