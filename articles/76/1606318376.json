As E. Sylvester Berry puts it in his book The Church of Christ: An Apologetic and Dogmatic Treatise: \u201cFinally, a society is indirectly subject to another if the means it employs to attain its end are in any way connected with the attainment of a higher good for its members in that other society. The State is therefore indirectly subject to the Church in this respect, since right reason demands that the State cede to the Church whatever is necessary for her preservation and the proper attainment of her higher purpose,--the eternal salvation of man. Moreover, the actions of civil officials in carrying out the duties of their office often have a moral aspect that affects the spiritual welfare committed to the care of the Church. Consequently, the Church has direct jurisdiction over the official acts of civil authorities in regard to the moral aspect of those acts if the persons in question happen to be subjects of the Church. In this matter, therefore, the Church also exercises an indirect authority over the State\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu May 14 10:56:54 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/icon/michael?2TWqSfnuXvBzAowfUt9XCPbVL", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "language": "en", "og": {"title": "All Against All: De Mattei Attacks His Friend Vigan\u00f2", "description": "The Roman historian Roberto de Mattei critizised Archbishop Vigan\u00f2's appeal against the Coronavirus regime.
