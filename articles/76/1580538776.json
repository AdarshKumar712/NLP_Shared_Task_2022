(WPRI) \u2500 A computer science professor at Brown University is among a group of international researchers developing a smartphone app that would allow users to trace their contacts without revealing any personal information.\n\nAnna Lysyanskaya said the app, dubbed Private Automated Contact Tracing (PACT), uses the Bluetooth signals that smartphones regularly exchange to track which devices come into close contact with one another.\n\nThe contact tracing tool would be utilized to track and slow down the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nLysyanskaya said the app creates a series of numbers as a \u201cpseudonym\u201d for each individual, allowing the user to see if they\u2019ve come into contact with an infected person through their pseudonym.\n\nThe pseudonyms, she said, are designed to protect a person\u2019s identity and personal information without compromising their privacy.\n\n\u201cCounting on people\u2019s memory is less than perfect, especially when you have a really busy life,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother feature the app will have is automatically logging when a smartphone receives a call from a contact tracing collaborate. Lysyanskaya said this means if someone calls you for contact tracing purposes, the app will have already logged that call for you.\n\nLysyanskaya said that creating, designing and testing a smartphone app normally takes six months to a year to complete, but her team is working around the clock to have theirs ready for users by the summer.\n\nBoth Apple and Google announced last week that they would make contact tracing apps possible on their downloading platforms within a month.\n\nCoronavirus: Coverage and Resources\n\nRI Coronavirus Hotline: (401) 222-8022 | Work-Related Questions: (401) 462-2020 | Mental Health Assistance: (401) 414-5465\n\nCoronavirus: Latest Headlines", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Brown University", "Coronavirus", "Coronavirus Concerns", "Providence"], "tags": ["Community Focus \u2022", "Cold Case Cards", "\u2022 Community Focus", "Nesi\u2019s Notes", "Remarkable Women", "Photos"], "authors": ["Sarah Doiron", "Rob Nesbitt", "Christopher Rugaber Ap Economics Writer", "Alexandra Leslie", "Melanie Dasilva", "Brandon Truitt"], "publish_date": "Thu Apr 16 23:55:37 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Anna Lysyanskaya said the project, called PACT: Private Automated Contact Tracing, uses the Bluetooth signals that smartphones regularly exchange to track which devices come into close contact with one another, which is helpful for contact tracing amid the global pandemic.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.wpri.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2019/05/cropped-12-WPRI-bug-favicon.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Anna Lysyanskaya said the project, called PACT: Private Automated Contact Tracing, uses the Bluetooth signals that smartphones regularly exchange to track which devices come into close contact with one another, which is helpful for contact tracing amid the global pandemic.", "keywords": "Brown University, Coronavirus, Coronavirus Concerns, Providence", "google-site-verification": "IhWWjMQK4whm-0cnYHO2oEeICWv8gt-z5E19sT9Dhgo", "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "fb": {"pages": 20074438201}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Brown professor developing contact-tracing app that promotes privacy", "url": "https://www.wpri.com/health/coronavirus/brown-professor-developing-contact-tracing-app-that-promotes-privacy/", "description": "Anna Lysyanskaya said the project, called PACT: Private Automated Contact Tracing, uses the Bluetooth signals that smartphones regularly exchange to track which devices come into close contact with\u2026", "site_name": "WPRI.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.wpri.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2020/04/Story_2366815_ver1.0.jpg?w=690&h=460&crop=1&resize=1280,720", "secure_url": "https://www.wpri.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2020/04/Story_2366815_ver1.0.jpg?w=690&h=460&crop=1&resize=1280,720"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-04-16T23:55:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-04-17T02:42:55+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Brown professor developing contact-tracing app that promotes privacy"}, "image": "https://www.wpri.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2020/04/Story_2366815_ver1.0.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brown professor developing contact-tracing app that promotes privacy", "description": "Anna Lysyanskaya said the project, called PACT: Private Automated Contact Tracing, uses the Bluetooth signals that smartphones regularly exchange to track which devices come into close contact with\u2026"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.wpri.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2019/05/cropped-12-WPRI-bug-favicon.png?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.wpri.com/health/coronavirus/brown-professor-developing-contact-tracing-app-that-promotes-privacy/"}
