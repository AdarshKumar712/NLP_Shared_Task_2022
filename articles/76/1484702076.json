The residents, who began the fast on Wednesday, alleged that their houses were damaged even in the pre-demolition work carried out by agencies contracted with demolishing them.\n\nThe authorities have set January 11 and 12 as dates for the demolition of over 300 flats. The intermediate walls of the buildings have been demolished through pre-demolition works and now the apartments are standing on bare structures.\n\nErnakulam district authorities and other agencies, including Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation, have started completing formalities, including issuing No Objection Certificates and clearance certificates to the firms won the contracts to bring down the structures, official sources said.\n\nAround 850 kg of explosives are reportedly required for the demolition of the buildings using controlled implosion. A total of 343 waterfront flats were built in the Maradu municipality by violating the Coastal Regulation Zone norms.\n\nThe Supreme Court in September last year had directed demolition of the apartment complexes within 138 days, a timeline given by the Kerala government. On May 8 last year, the apex court had directed that\n\nthese buildings be removed within a month as they were constructed in a notified CRZ, which was part of the tidally-influenced water body in Kerala.\n\nThe court had passed the order after taking note of a report of a three-member committee, which said when the buildings were built, the area was already notified as a CRZ and construction was prohibited.\n\nGet the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.
