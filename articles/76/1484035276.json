He\u2019s trailed closely by Microsoft founder Bill Gates, whose estimated worth is $113 billion.\n\nBezos, Gates and French business magnate Bernard Arnault are the only three billionaires on the list whose net worths exceed $100 billion.\n\nBezos was expected to lose the top spot in the billionaire index after a choppy year for his finances. As part of his divorce settlement with ex-wife Mackenzie Bezos, he held onto 75% of the couple\u2019s Amazon stock.\n\nThe rest went to his former wife, who also received a 4% stake in the company. That amounted to around $37 billion, making her the 25th-richest person in the world.\n\nGates briefly toppled Bezos in November after Amazon profits fell nearly 28% from the previous year while Microsoft shares soared 48%. But his time at the top was short-lived.\n\nFamiliar faces round out the current top 10. Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg clock in fourth and fifth. The Facebook founder added a staggering $26.3 billion to his personal wealth this year.\n\nJulia Flesher Koch, widow of conservative businessman David Koch and the only woman in the top 10, is worth $62 billion.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/krdo.com/2019/11/cropped-krdo-logo-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jeff Bezos is still the richest person in the world - KRDO", "description": "Jeff Bezos is still the richest person in the world, even after losing $10 billion in one year.
