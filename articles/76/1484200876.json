Mr. Pipat Ratchakitprakan.\n\n\u201cWe are gathered here today to celebrate another arrival milestone for Thailand as we are both proud and grateful for this achievement. It shows that the entire Thai tourism industry remains committed to promoting quality tourism, to bring a better quality of life to all Thai people and continue to promote responsible tourism that both preserves Thailand\u2019s tourism assets and generates revenue for the country,\u201d H.E. Mr. Pipat, said.\n\nAfter clearing immigration, she was invited to the latest welcome ceremony and was greeted by senior officials and VIPs from Thailand\u2019s tourism industry, including the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), Suvarnabhumi Airport, Immigration Bureau and Thai Airways International (THAI).\n\nMr. Tanes Petsuwan, TAT Deputy Governor for Marketing Communications, said, \u201cThe new record of 39 million arrivals to Thailand shows that the TAT\u2019s focus of promoting unexpected experiences in Thailand\u2019s secondary destinations is paying off and attracting more visitors. This is also in line with the government\u2019s direction to spread income to all levels of society while at the same time promoting responsible tourism.\u201d\n\nA \u2018Luckiest Visitor\u2019 jacket was presented to Mrs. Pavlovskaya in addition to a certificate, round-trip tickets for two between her country of residence and Thailand valid for one year, and a voucher for five nights\u2019 accommodation at a four or five-star hotel in Thailand.\n\nShe also received gifts and souvenirs from representatives from Suvarnabhumi Airport, the Thai Tourist Police, and Immigration Department before being whisked away to their hotel in town in an exclusive airport limousine provided by THAI.\n\nMrs. Srisuda Wanapinyosak, TAT Deputy Governor for International Marketing \u2013 Europe, Africa, Middle East and Americas, added, \u201cWe are confident that Thailand will achieve our international tourism target of 39.77 million arrivals, which represents a 4% year-on-year increase. These will generate 1.96 trillion Baht revenue, also a 4% growth. Meanwhile, domestic tourism will reach 167 million trips, a 1% growth, and distribute 1.10 trillion Baht revenue. This means tourism will help inject 3.06 trillion Baht to the Thai economy this year.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["39th millionth tourist", "Luckiest Visitor"], "authors": ["Tat Newsroom", "The Tat International Public Relations Division Works With Traditional", "Online Media Channels To Promote Thailand As A Tourism Destination For Travellers Worldwide."], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Bangkok, 27 December, 2019\u00a0- Thailand welcomed its 39th millionth tourist to the Kingdom today, a record high for the country that surpassed last week", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i2.wp.com/www.tatnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cropped-favicon.png?fit=32%2C32&ssl=1", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Thailand lays out red carpet to welcome its 39th millionth tourist - TAT Newsroom", "type": "article", "description": "Bangkok, 27 December, 2019\u00a0- Thailand welcomed its 39th millionth tourist to the Kingdom today, a re", "url": "https://www.tatnews.org/2019/12/thailand-lays-out-red-carpet-to-welcome-its-39th-millionth-tourist/", "site_name": "TAT Newsroom", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.tatnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/39-millionth-tourist-2-resize.jpg?resize=780%2C470&ssl=1"}, "generator": "WordPress Download Manager 3.0.6", "description": "Bangkok, 27 December, 2019\u00a0- Thailand welcomed its 39th millionth tourist to the Kingdom today, a record high for the country that surpassed last week", "theme-color": "#e9297b", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i2.wp.com/www.tatnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cropped-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.tatnews.org/2019/12/thailand-lays-out-red-carpet-to-welcome-its-39th-millionth-tourist/"}
