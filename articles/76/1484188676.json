The article was the first installment of 7,000 pages of highly classified documents that exposed the decision-making process that had led the United States into an interminably long and destructive war.\n\nEarlier, on the same day that the transcript was recorded, June 30, the U.S. Supreme Court, citing the First Amendment, ruled 6-3 that the Times had the right to publish the stolen documents.\n\nThe journalist who published the article stated that \"It was just an exquisite moment of vindication for the freedom of the press in this country and how important it is.\"\n\nThe President, on that very same day ordered his Attorney General to discredit the source of the documents, a man who had just been indicted by a federal grand jury under the questionable strictures of the Espionage Act of 1917. Sound familiar?\n\nThe redactions in the transcript are mine.\n\nPresident: Don't you agree that we have to pursue the ... (redacted) case?\n\nAttorney General: No question about it. No question about it. This is the one sanction we have, is to get at the individuals ...\n\nPresident: Let's get the son of a b*tch into jail.\n\nNational Security Adviser: We've got to get him, we've got to get him \"\n\nPresident: Don't worry about his trial. Just get everything out. Try him in the press. Try him in the press. Everything, ... (redacted), that there is on the investigation, get it out, leak it out. We want to destroy him in the press. Is that clear?\n\nAttorney General: Yes.\n\nSo even though the highest Court in America ruled that the release of the documents was both lawful, and in the public interest, the President and his administration sought to go after, jail, and demolish those who were involved in the leaking of the documents.\n\nNext Page 1 | 2", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Daniel Ellsberg", "Julian Assange Imprisonment", "Truth", "Wikileaks"], "tags": ["Truth", "Julian Assange Imprisonment", "Daniel Ellsberg", "Wikileaks"], "authors": ["Keith Davis"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Article: The stitching-up of Julian Assange and Daniel Ellsberg. - We live in an era where truth is far more strongly suppressed than it ever was, where the populace is apathetic and supportive of political populism, and where the journalists who expose that suppression of truth are pursued with the full force of the State.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"description": "Article: The stitching-up of Julian Assange and Daniel Ellsberg. - We live in an era where truth is far more strongly suppressed than it ever was, where the populace is apathetic and supportive of political populism, and where the journalists who expose that suppression of truth are pursued with the full force of the State.", "keywords": "Daniel Ellsberg,Julian Assange Imprisonment,Truth,Wikileaks", "fb": {"admins": 737810614, "app_id": 157889207614942}, "generator": "Populum - \ufeffContent management software for hybrid blog/media/commerce communities", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"url": "https://www.opednews.com/articles/The-stitching-up-of-Julian-by-Keith-Davis-Daniel-Ellsberg_Julian-Assange-Imprisonment_Truth_Wikileaks-191231-578.html", "site_name": "OpEdNews", "title": "The stitching-up of Julian Assange and Daniel Ellsberg.", "description": "We live in an era where truth is far more strongly suppressed than it ever was, where the populace is apathetic and supportive of political populism, and where the journalists who expose that suppression of truth are pursued with the full force of the State.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.opednews.com/populum/visuals/2019/12/2019-12-1025--2-225.jpg", "width": 650, "height": 365}, "type": "website", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"title": "The stitching-up of Julian Assange and Daniel Ellsberg.", "description": "We live in an era where truth is far more strongly suppressed than it ever was, where the populace is apathetic and supportive of political populism, and where the journalists who expose that suppression of truth are pursued with the full force of the State.", "image": "https://www.opednews.com/populum/visuals/2019/12/2019-12-1025--2-225.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@opednews"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.opednews.com/articles/The-stitching-up-of-Julian-by-Keith-Davis-Daniel-Ellsberg_Julian-Assange-Imprisonment_Truth_Wikileaks-191231-578.html"}
