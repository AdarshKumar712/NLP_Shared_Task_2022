France doesn't have a coronavirus problem but I have a feeling it will-- we all will-- by summer. As you can see above, South Korea didn't have problem last week; but they sure do now-- a big surge in identified infections and a death of a man who has been hospitalized for more than 20 year. (In other words, medical professionals are failing to contain this in their own facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the updated advice we'd pass along to Bernie's campaign:\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Risk\n\n\u2022 This contagion runs far ahead of visible symptoms\n\n\u2022 It also hits older people much harder than younger people\n\nHealth Precautions\n\n\u2022 Immediately reroute Bernie\u2019s schedule away from rope lines and other hands, hugs and crowding\n\n\u2022 Quickly refocus national surrogates\u2019 on-site activities away from locations with highest numbers of travellers from Asia, such as Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego, in favor of campaigning in South Carolina and Super Tuesday states\u2019 rural areas, where the virus is unlikely to spread as quickly.\n\nPolitical Risk\n\n\u2022 Much worse than suspension of March 3 elections would be appearance that: (a) Berners had alleged political motives for suspensions, (b) which are later perceived to have been justified by public health precautions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRhetorical Contingencies\n\nContagious new and stealthy viruses remind us that:\n\n\n\n\u2022 \"Each one of us is easily infected by anybody in our community who faces financial barriers to getting check-ups and treatment, so Medicare For All is a necessary protection for all of us\"\n\n\u2022 \"Each country\u2019s safety now depends on maintaining communication and cooperation with other countries, while minimizing disruption from mutual suspicion and hostility\"\n\n\u2022 \"We remember when news of the Soviet Union\u2019s Sputnik satellite suddenly changed our national culture and catalyzed our development of new technologies and industries. In response to today\u2019s sudden viral pandemic threat, and to the slower but surer threat of climate collapse, we need another change of culture, to resist these threats against all of our people, and all peoples.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["South Korea", "flu pandemics", "coronavirus"], "authors": ["Gaius Publius"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.blogger.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"generator": "Blogger"}, "canonical_link": ""}
