Here, online learning refers to\nthe framework of regret minimization under worst-case assumptions. I present\nfirst-order and second-order algorithms for online learning with convex losses,\nin Euclidean and non-Euclidean settings. All the algorithms are clearly\npresented as instantiation of Online Mirror Descent or\nFollow-The-Regularized-Leader and their variants. Particular attention is given\nto the issue of tuning the parameters of the algorithms and learning in\nunbounded domains, through adaptive and parameter-free online learning\nalgorithms. Non-convex losses are dealt through convex surrogate losses and\nthrough randomization. The bandit setting is also briefly discussed, touching\non the problem of adversarial and stochastic multi-armed bandits. These notes\ndo not require prior knowledge of convex analysis and all the required\nmathematical tools are rigorously explained. Moreover, all the proofs have been\ncarefully chosen to be as simple and as short as possible."}}, "canonical_link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13213v1"}
