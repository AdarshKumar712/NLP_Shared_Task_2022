Kylie Jenner, Rita Ora, Amber Rose and her boyfriend, Alexander \u201cAE\u201d Edwards, all scored an invite to The Weeknd\u2019s (real name: Abel Tesfaye) big New Year\u2019s Eve bash at his Beverly Hills home on Tuesday, December 31.\n\nThe 22-year-old KUWTK starlet was dressed to the nines as she sported sparkly thigh-high boots paired with a sparkly dress. Earlier in the night, the billionaire took to Instagram to share her car ride with her bestie Yris Palmer \u2014 a.k.a. her New Year\u2019s date. At the party, Kylie looked to be surrounded by security while wearing a black coat. Hopefully, she had a good time!\n\nAmber, 36, detailed some of the night on her Instagram Stories, too. The model \u2014 who welcomed a baby boy named Slash Electric Alexander Edwards with her beau in October \u2014 looked amazing in a leopard dress and a silver choker. Amber shared a video with Alexander, 32, as soon as the clock striked midnight. Of course, the two shared a kiss in honor of the big moment. \u201cBaby daddy AF,\u201d she captioned a clip of the rapper dancing.\n\nLater on, the pair looked loved up on the \u2018gram. Even though the duo had a date night, they seemed content at their humble abode. \u201cSo, it\u2019s one o\u2019clock in the morning, and we\u2019re home and this is what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she said to the camera. \u201cFrozen pizza and me and my baby daddy are about to go into the theater room. Shout-out to The Weeknd \u2014 we had so much fun at your party. Thank you for inviting us. Now we are home with our babies, and we are about to eat some pizza and watch some Netflix and chill.\u201d Now, that sounds like our kind of night!\n\nMeanwhile, Rita, 29, looked stunning in a shiny yellow gown paired with white pumps as she arrived at the soir\u00e9e. The singer appeared to be with two friends and looked to be in a great mood as she posed for the cameras. Get it, girl! The U.K. native reflected on the past year via her Instagram Stories, and it seems like she is excited for what\u2019s to come.\n\nAll in all, it seems like everyone had a great night together.
