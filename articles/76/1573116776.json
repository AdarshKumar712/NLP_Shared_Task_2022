Many countries hit hardest by the virus are also those that can least afford the costs, like Italy and Spain. But they are divided over how best to tackle the challenge.\n\nItaly and Spain, backed by France, want to throw all the EU\u2019s economic might into fighting the virus and damage from the disruption it has caused as soon as possible. The deadlock recalls the divisions from the eurozone debt crisis of 2010-2015.\n\nOn the table is a three-part package amounting to around a half a trillion euros (\u00a3440 billion). It consists of up to 240 billion euros (\u00a3210 billion) in emergency loans from the eurozone\u2019s standing bailout fund, credit guarantees from the European Investment Bank to keep companies afloat, and support for short-work schemes that help companies avoid layoffs during what is hoped are temporary business interruptions.\n\nItaly has rejected using the bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). One reason is that the money is supposed to come with conditions to carry out economic reforms, based on the fund\u2019s original purpose as a bailout refuge for troubled countries.\n\nItaly argues that makes the ESM the wrong tool since the virus is no country\u2019s fault. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has dismissed the bailout fund as \u201ctotally inadequate\u201d. Germany has proposed waiving most conditions on the money, but the Netherlands has pushed for requiring reform promises.\n\nThe issue of conditions raises the spectre of the harsh austerity imposed on Greece after its three bailouts during the debt crisis, with deep cuts in spending and salaries, official visits by an enforcement committee and the perception of a loss of national sovereignty.\n\nGerman finance minister Olaf Scholz said he and his peers were close to a deal on the bailout loans, company support and short-work schemes. He said the position of Germany and other countries was that loans should come with minimal conditions and \u201cshould not mean that, as happened 10 years ago, commissars or a troika travel to the countries and develop a programme for the long-term\u201d.\n\nItaly, backed by France, Spain and six other countries, had pushed to go even farther than using the ESM and rely on a shared bond issue backed by all countries to raise money at low interest rates and favourable conditions such as long repayment.\n\nGermany and the Netherlands have resisted common borrowing. Scholz said there had been discussions about a longer-term recovery programme that could be discussed separately from the three aid programmes under discussion but did not provide details.\n\nFrench finance minister Bruno Le Maire tweeted that he and Scholz \u201ccall on all European states to rise to the exceptional challenges to reach an ambitious agreement\u201d.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["nations", "struggle", "agree", "terms", "coronavirus"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "BRUSSELS: European governments remain at loggerheads over measures to help the economy weather the coronavirus outbreak, breaking off a meeting of finance officials who clashed over aid conditions...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "TITLE": "EU nations struggle to agree on terms of coronavirus aid | Top Story | thenews.com.pk", "description": "BRUSSELS: European governments remain at loggerheads over measures to help the economy weather the coronavirus outbreak, breaking off a meeting of finance officials who clashed over aid conditions...", "keywords": "nations,struggle,agree,terms,coronavirus", "fb": {"app_id": 650123461797330}, "og": {"title": "EU nations struggle to agree on terms of coronavirus aid", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 390}, "description": "BRUSSELS: European governments remain at loggerheads over measures to help the economy weather the coronavirus outbreak, breaking off a meeting of finance officials who clashed over aid conditions...", "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/641419-eu-nations-struggle-to-agree-on-terms-of-coronavirus-aid", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thenews_intl", "creator": "@PPa", "title": "EU nations struggle to agree on terms of coronavirus aid", "description": "BRUSSELS: European governments remain at loggerheads over measures to help the economy weather the coronavirus outbreak, breaking off a meeting of finance officials who clashed over aid conditions...", "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=033005"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The News International", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#333333", "theme-color": "#000000"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/641419-eu-nations-struggle-to-agree-on-terms-of-coronavirus-aid"}
