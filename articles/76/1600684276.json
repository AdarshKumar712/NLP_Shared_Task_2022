There have been more than 2,000 related deaths. On the other hand, at least 38,000 former Coronavirus patients have been cured so far.\n\nSaxony Wants Incremental Easing\n\nNow that the measures taken seem to be showing their first effects, two federal states want an incremental easing. In Saxony, First Minister Michael Kretschmer said there would be a cabinet meeting on April 15th during which the matter would be discussed. Kretschmer did say that there would not be a quick return to normality though.\n\nWhile some federal states, such as Bavaria, have surged ahead several times, the \u2018contact ban\u2019 and most other restrictions are usually being implemented after video conferences Chancellor Angela Merkel holds with the First Ministers of Germany\u2019s sixteen federal states.\n\n\u2018Flexible Answers\u2019\n\nOne would assume that the same will apply to an easing of the measures, but the regional government in Saxony seems to have different ideas. \u201cWe want to present the prospect of unburdening measures to the public because of the positive development we see\u201d, Kretschmer stated.\n\nFurther west, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Kretschmer\u2019s colleague Armin Laschet said he wanted a time table for a removal of the restrictions. A schedule for the way towards normality was needed, Laschet said. There had to be \u201cflexible answers\u201d that would provide the same kind of protection, but \u201cin a more targeted way\u201d.\n\nFDP Wants Easing of Measures\n\nJust after the Western Easter (the Christian Orthodox Easter is being observed later), on April 14th, 2020, the First Ministers and Chancellor Angela Merkel will have their next video conference during which a balance is supposed to be drawn. Laschet intends to use the opportunity to hand in a proposal.\n\nFor the liberal party FDP, its leader Christian Lindner demanded an easing of the measures as well. He said the federal government should follow the latest suggestions by the German Ethics Council according to which there needs to be a \u201cconcept plan\u201d for an easing of the bans and restrictions.\n\nM\u00fcller Apologizes to U.S.\n\nProtective masks were useful, but muzzles were not, Lindner said. He meant the government was wrong by telling people not to talk about an easing of the restrictions in public. The opposition is having a hard time because a majority supports the government in this crisis. The government parties CDU, CSU and SPD are gaining support while the opposition is shrinking in the polls.\n\nIn the meantime, Berlin\u2019s Governing Mayor Michael M\u00fcller has apologized for statements he and his Interior Senator Andreas Geisel made regarding an order of 200,000 protective masks for the Berlin Police Department which never arrived. They had claimed the masks had been \u201cconfiscated\u201d by the United States at Bangkok Airport.\n\nM\u00fcller Regrets Statements\n\nM\u00fcller had accused U.S. President Donald Trump of an \u201cinhumane and unacceptable\u201d behavior. Geisel had even talked about \u201can act of modern day piracy\u201d and \u201cWild West methods.\u201d Both had asked the federal government to discuss the problem with the Trump Administration.\n\nWhile there is still no public knowledge about what exactly happened to that order of 200,000 masks which may have been \u201crerouted\u201d to the United States, Governing Mayor M\u00fcller apologized to the U.S. by saying those statements had contained a severity he now regretted. He said he was sorry.\n\nAmbassador Grenell Comments\n\nThe American Embassy in Berlin reacted by saying it had noted the Governing Mayor\u2019s apology. A spokesperson stated the Embassy regretted that the accusations, which they had rejected, had led to additional tensions during a crisis that needed to be overcome mutually. Ambassador Richard Grenell, on the other hand, reportedly told the ultra-conservative TV channel Fox News \u201cM\u00fcller\u2019s anti-Americanism\u201d was well known. It was no surprise he had spread \u201canother fake story\u201d.\n\nInterior Senator Andreas Geisel announced nothing had changed regarding the masks, so far. He said there would be talks with the U.S. Embassy with the purpose of resolving the issue. Geisel also said he and the Senate had \u201cmore important things to do than to argue about masks with the United States.\u201d\n\nUnusually Harsh Statements\n\nWhile President Trump himself is generally not exactly known for mincing his words, the accusations against him from M\u00fcller and Geisel were a lot harsher than the kind of language they normally use. Just like Ambassador Grenell, who is known for his strong wording as well, conservative media in Germany had accused them of anti-Americanism. On Monday, Chancellor Merkel had said the issue needed to be resolved.\n\nWhile the matter about those 200,000 masks was still being worked on, Berlin received two million masks from Asia the other day. More are on their way. The German Health Ministry now has a procurement division that deals with getting medical supplies for the entire country.\n\nLufthansa Group Drops \u2018Germanwings\u2019\n\nThe impact of the Corona crisis on the airline industry becomes more evident almost every day. Lufthansa Group just announced it would drop the \u2018Germanwings\u2019 brand and get rid of many aircraft. The company said it was talking to its \u201csocial partners\u201d about the implications, meaning layoffs can not be prevented, it seems.\n\nBy the way: The publication you are reading, The Berlin Spectator, was established in January of 2019.
