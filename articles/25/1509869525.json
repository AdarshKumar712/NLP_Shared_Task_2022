It should go beyond the denial of a US visa to a senator,\u201d Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBecause what if the US restores the visa of my good friend Senator Bato, are we then going to reverse course, and press the stop button to the revocation process which, per reports, has been started?\u201d\n\n\u201cPaano kung bukas sasabihin ng Amerika na restored na ang visa ni Bato, ano gagawin natin? Is that the remedial action we are seeking or are we motivated by reasons more profound?\u201d Recto said.\n\n(What if tomorrow the US says Bato\u2019s visa has been restored, what are we going to do? Is that the remedial action we are seeking or are we motivated by reasons more profound?)\n\nHe said the Philippines should be able to at least prove that the VFA is unfavorable to the country before revoking it.\n\nREAD: No stopping Duterte from ending VFA\n\n\u201cWe must be able to separate the national interest from the personal. The national harm done by the VFA is an issue separate from the actions taken by the other government on a certain individual,\u201d Recto said.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte ordered last week the abrogation of the VFA between the Philippines and the US after Dela Rosa confirmed that the US government had revoked his visa.\n\nREAD: Confirmed: US voids Senator Bato dela Rosa\u2019s visa\n\n\u201cPersonally, tingin ko mali ang ginawa ng Amerika kay Bato. BFF nila si Bato noon. Red carpet treatment sa FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) \u2018yan. But our response should be commensurate,\u201d Recto said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n(Personally I think, what America did to Bato was wrong. Bato is their BFF. They gave him a red-carpet treatment at the FBI. But our response should be commensurate.)\n\nDela Rosa, a former chief of the Philippine National Police, however, insisted that Duterte\u2019s order to end the agreement was not only because of his visa cancellation.\n\n\u201cAng sinasabi ko na nga hindi ako importante bakit ako ang gagawin nyong reason?\u201d he said, noting Duterte\u2019s claim that the visa cancellation was just the last straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\n(I\u2019ve been saying that I\u2019m not important so why are you using me as a reason?)\n\n\u201cNapupuno na s\u2019ya (Duterte) so dapat may aksyon syang gagawin. Hindi naman ako ang dahilan\u2026\u201d Dela Rosa also said.\n\n(He is already getting impatient so he had to act. I\u2019m not the reason here\u2026)\n\nBut it would still be better if the two allies could find a way to rescue their \u201cdying relationship,\u201d according to the senator.\n\n\u201cThe more friends, the better,\u201d Dela Rosa said.\n\nEdited by KGA\n\nRead Next\n\nEDITORS' PICK\n\nMOST READ", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["INQUIRER.net", "Maila Ager"], "authors": ["Maila Ager"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The cancellation of Senator Ronald \u201cBato\u201d dela Rosa\u2019s visa may be wrong but there must be a \u201cdeeper\u201d reason why VFA must be terminated.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//newsinfo.inquirer.net/landing2017/images/favicon2.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"ttl": 345600, "title": "Recto wants \u2018deeper\u2019 reason for  VFA scrapping", "description": "MANILA, Philippines \u2014 The cancellation of Senator Ronald \u201cBato\u201d dela Rosa\u2019s visa may be wrong but there must be a \u201cdeeper\u201d reason why the Philippines should terminate its Visiting Forces", "url": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1221745/recto-wants-deeper-reason-for-vfa-scrapping", "image": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2019/07/33850516_2200373159978593_5266413766492291072_n-620x418.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 175228195865217, "pages": 142802334452}, "author": "Maila Ager", "description": "The cancellation of Senator Ronald \u201cBato\u201d dela Rosa\u2019s visa may be wrong but there must be a \u201cdeeper\u201d reason why VFA must be terminated.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The cancellation of Senator Ronald \u201cBato\u201d dela Rosa\u2019s visa may be wrong but there must be a \u201cdeeper\u201d reason why VFA must be terminated.", "title": "Recto wants 'deeper' reason for VFA scrapping | Inquirer News", "site": "@inquirerdotnet", "image": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2019/07/33850516_2200373159978593_5266413766492291072_n.jpg", "creator": "@inquirerdotnet"}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1221745/recto-wants-deeper-reason-for-vfa-scrapping?ia_markup=1"}}, "canonical_link": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1221745/recto-wants-deeper-reason-for-vfa-scrapping"}
