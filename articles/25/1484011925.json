Al Green admitted that the \u201cgenesis\u201d of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment began well before he was elected President in 2016.\n\nGreen was asked to respond to the argument of the right that \u201cthe Democrats wanted to impeach Donald Trump from day one, they cast about looking for a set of facts they could plausibly use to do it, and all of it was pretextual and reverse-engineered to get to this point. Exhibit one is Al Green, who\u2019s been calling for the man\u2019s impeachment for two years now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the genesis of impeachment \u2014 to be very candid with you \u2014 was when the president was running for office and he had members of his own party to talk about his unfitness to hold office,\u201d Green conceded. \u201cThe persons who were running against him, Mr. Romney spoke of his not being fit to hold office. Mr. Cruz made statements about it\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd there you have it: Democrats intended from the beginning to impeach Trump, and years of fruitless investigations into purported Russian collusion and Ukrainian corruption were merely pretexts.\n\n0 Known Connections\n\nDuring an August 23, 2018 appearance on Democracy Now!, Green said that President Trump could be impeached without having committed a crime: \u201cI think it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that the president will have two options: One, he can resign from office, or, two, he can face impeachment. Impeachment is something that the Framers of the Constitution provided for a time such as this and a president such as Trump \u2026 [who] is alleged to have committed certain offenses that are onerous to the Constitution and that harm society.\u201d\n\nAt a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation meeting in September 2018, Green revisited the theme of impeaching President Trump:\n\n\u201cThe people who say, \u2018What law did he break? What rule did he break?,\u2019 they are perpetrating upon you a belief that is totally inaccurate. You decide that you are not going to be nice to suspects when you arrest them, you tell police, \u2018You don\u2019t have to be nice,\u2019 \u2026 and ban children on the border of color, you produce a policy that separates them from their parents\u2026. Now, this might be debatable, [but] for me, when I add all of this together, I find that I have a person who is placing his bigotry into policy that is harmful to our society, and for that, he ought to be impeached.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Al Green, click on the profile link HERE.\n\nSearch our constantly growing database of the left and its Agendas.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: This Discover the Networks column is republished with permission. \u00a9 All rights reserved.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Politics", "News", "Social Issues", "Waste, Fraud and Abuse", "Policy", "Commentary", "Elections"], "authors": ["Discover The Networks"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://drrichswier.com/2020/01/01/rep-green-impeachment-genesis-was-before-election/"}
