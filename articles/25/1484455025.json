Officials at Bihar Information Centre in Delhi said though the Centre appreciated the state government\u2019s theme of Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Mission proposed for its tableau, but refused to showcase it in the Republic Day parade because \u201cit does not fulfil the criteria for that\u201d. Bihar was not included in the R-Day parade in 2019 as well.\u201cAs the state government is working on the ambitious JJH Mission, which is one of a kind initiative to tackle climate change and water conservation, it was proposed as our theme for Bihar\u2019s tableau in national R-Day parade. We had submitted a proposal in this regard to the defence ministry in September. But the ministry later claimed that as per the set criteria for Republic Day parade, state governments cannot make their tableaux on such a theme,\u201d a senior official at Bihar Information Centre said.Sources said the selection committee under the defence ministry has set stringent criteria for selecting tableaux for R-Day parade. According to sources, the entries sent by states have to pass three rounds of scrutiny by the selection committee. The broad parameters for evaluating the themes proposed by the states include international branding, national integration and aesthetic value.\u201cEven though the selection committee appreciated our theme and the state government\u2019s endeavours under the JJH Mission, it turned down our proposal for showcasing the same in the R-Day parade,\u201d he said and added that Bihar government had proposed prohibition as the theme for its tableau in 2019 but it was also rejected for similar reasons.Officials said the last time Bihar featured in the R-Day parade in Delhi was in 2015 when its tableau was based on the celebrations of 100 years of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s Champaran Satyagraha. Prior to that, the theme for Bihar\u2019s tableau in 2013 was \u2018Mithila ka Sikki art\u2019. Sikki is a traditional folk craft of Mithila region. In 2012, the theme for Bihar\u2019s tableau was \u2018Dharhara Ki Beti\u2019. Dharhara is a village in Bhagalpur district. It is famous for its tradition of planting of trees by families on the birth of a girl child.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Patna news", "Patna latest news", "Patna news live", "Patna news today", "Today news Patna", "Tableau plan rejected", "Republic Day parade", "Republic day", "R-Day tableau", "Delhi Republic Day Parade", "Bihar"], "tags": ["Delhi Air Pollution", "Delhi Smog", "Fire in Mumbai", "Mumbai Rains", "Bangalore Temperature", "Hyderabad Rain", "Delhi Temperature", "Srinagar encounter", "Chennai Weather", "Republic Day parade", "Republic Day"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Bihar will not be represented in the Republic Day parade at Janpath in New Delhi on January 26.
