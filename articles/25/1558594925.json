Photo: courtesy of Roxanne Collins\n\nWe've heard a lot, and rightfully so, about how the coronavirus closures are affecting live music and the livelihood of musical acts. The closure of bars and clubs has affected another community of performers: drag queens.\n\nNo more drag brunches or midnight shows, at least for the time being. Roxanne Collins, a lauded Houston performer and renowned Tina Turner impersonator, is doing something about it.\n\nCollins will host \"QuaranTina\" at 9 p.m. Friday from her Facebook page. The hourlong show will feature songs from several of Turner's albums, including \"Private Dancer,\" \"Break Every Rule\" and \"Foreign Affair.\" And of course Collins will do \"Proud Mary.\" She'll continue doing livestreams while she's home, digging into Turner's more recent work.\n\n\"As the isolation became a stay home order and off work extension, I knew I needed to do something,\" Collins says. \"People often underestimate the love I receive through my work that translates financially. I have been so blessed to make a career out of doing what I love to do. I have faith, and my faith is strong. I will be OK, and in the end, better than before this happened. You will make it through this, too. We are gonna make it together.\"\n\nSpoken like a true diva.\n\nThe stars of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" are also doing their part. The Werq the World livestream will feature performances by some of the show's most popular queens, 7 p.m. April 4 at vossevents.com. Bianca Del Rio and Lady Bunny will host. Admission is $7.99 for the first 5,000 people. Proceeds will go to local performers across the country.\n\nHouston drag entertainers who have lost all income due to shutdowns can apply for aid at vossevents.com/aid.\n\nJoey Guerra is the music critic for the Houston Chronicle.
