"movies": [], "text": "President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said he'd be willing to testify in the Senate's impeachment trial of the president and added that he would like the opportunity to try the case himself.\n\nThe former New York City mayor made the statement while fielding questions from journalists outside Trump\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI would testify, I would do demonstrations, I\u2019d give lectures, I\u2019d give summations. Or, I do what I do best, I try the case,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to try the case,\u201d Giuliani said. When asked if that\u2019s what he\u2019s actually going to do, Giuliani answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody would have the courage to give me the case, but if you give me the case, I will prosecute it as a racketeering case, which I kind of invented anyway.\u201d\n\nGiuliani's answer to being asked if he'd testify at the impeachment trial is completely insane pic.twitter.com/8BMjVy4r9A \u2014 Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) January 1, 2020\n\nIt's unclear if the Senate will accept new witnesses for the impeachment trial. Democrats have urged Senate Republicans to force witnesses to testify in the trial; however, Republicans have floated calling witnesses from which the Democrats don't want to hear.\n\nGiuliani's overseas actions have been a big part of the case against the president. He conducted an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. He has also been looking into the younger Biden's work with Ukrainian company Burisma, which faced allegations of corruption while the elder Biden was still in office.\n\nThe president encouraged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to work with Giuliani and to open an investigation into his political foe. The call set off impeachment proceedings in the House, which culminated last month with Trump becoming the third U.S. president to be impeached.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["News", "Ukraine", "Beltway Confidential", "Impeachment", "Rudy Giuliani", "President Trump"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 13:22:31 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said he'd be willing to testify in the Senate's impeachment trial of the president and added that he would like the opportunity to try the case himself.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "pages": "page"}, "description": "President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said he'd be willing to testify in the Senate's impeachment trial of the president and added that he would like the opportunity to try the case himself.", "brightspot.contentId": "0000016f-6123-d066-a7ff-e36345ae0000", "og": {"title": "Giuliani says he'd testify in Senate impeachment trial and offers to 'try the case'", "url": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-says-hed-testify-in-senate-impeachment-trial-and-offers-to-try-the-case", "image": {"identifier": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba4867a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+63/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F90%2Fea%2Ff985ce9743c2b74c333bbbe08b8a%2Frudyg.jpg", "url": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba4867a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+63/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F90%2Fea%2Ff985ce9743c2b74c333bbbe08b8a%2Frudyg.jpg", "secure_url": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba4867a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+63/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F90%2Fea%2Ff985ce9743c2b74c333bbbe08b8a%2Frudyg.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/png", "alt": "Rudy Giuliani"}, "description": "President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said he'd be willing to testify in the Senate's impeachment trial of the president and added that he would like the opportunity to try the case himself.", "site_name": "Washington Examiner", "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/author/mike-brest", "published_time": "2020-01-01T13:22:31.881", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T14:24:14.694", "section": "News", "tag": "Ukraine"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said he'd be willing to testify in the Senate's impeachment trial of the president and added that he would like the opportunity to try the case himself.", "image": {"identifier": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f88c1ef/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1288+0+20/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F90%2Fea%2Ff985ce9743c2b74c333bbbe08b8a%2Frudyg.jpg", "alt": "Rudy Giuliani"}, "site": "@DCExaminer", "title": "Giuliani says he'd testify in Senate impeachment trial and offers to 'try the case'", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "brightspot.cached": "true", "dy": {"url": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-says-hed-testify-in-senate-impeachment-trial-and-offers-to-try-the-case"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-says-hed-testify-in-senate-impeachment-trial-and-offers-to-try-the-case"}
