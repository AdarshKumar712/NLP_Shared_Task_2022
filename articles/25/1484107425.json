We\u2019ve seen drama in Memphis with James Wiseman leaving school to turn pro and teams building their tournament resumes.\n\nThere are two AAC teams in the AP Top 25 Poll this week with Memphis coming in at nine and Wichita State joining the rankings at 24. Houston also received some votes in this week\u2019s poll following their win against Washington.\n\nThose three have put themselves into the best position to get an at large bid come March. There\u2019s no reason to think the AAC can\u2019t get four or more bids this year, there\u2019s a lot of quality. Things didn\u2019t look great to start the season but they\u2019ve turned it around down the stretch with some big wins.\n\nConference play is a different stage, every game is important for these teams for seeding in the AAC tournament and there\u2019s a lot of teams capable of winning that. The middle of the pack in the AAC is a lot better than in recent years setting things up to be good. There\u2019s not very many \u201cgive me\u201d games for teams.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of basketball still to be played this season but we\u2019ll take a look at the resume for teams and how they faired in non-conference play, we\u2019ll also look at how they set up for conference play and some expectations.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Brian Rauf", "Brian Foley", "Matthew Winick", "Paul Kasabian", "Holden Walter-Warner", "Ben Andreatta"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Very little change in the AAC Basketball power rankings before conference games, how do the teams stack up going into the new year?", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://bustingbrackets.com/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Very little change in the AAC Basketball power rankings before conference games, how do the teams stack up going into the new year?", "DC.date.issued": "2019-12-31T08:00:41-05:00", "generator": "WordPress 4.9.13", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bustingbrackets", "title": "AAC Basketball power rankings: Memphis, Wichita State leads heading into league play", "description": "Very little change in the AAC Basketball power rankings before conference games, how do the teams stack up going into the new year?
