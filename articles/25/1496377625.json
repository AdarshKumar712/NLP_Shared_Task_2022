This helped make studying feel more of an adventurous challenge and less of a stressful and boring process.\u201d\n\nHer subjects included English home language, Afrikaans first additional language, life orientation, mathematics, accounting, life sciences and physical sciences.\n\n\u201cMy favourite subject was Afrikaans because it was different to the other subjects and my teacher, Reinette Tylcoat, never failed to put a smile on my face during lessons.\u201d\n\nThe matric year is notorious for being fast-paced and crammed with work.\n\nThis is one of the biggest challenges pupils face.\n\n\u201cTowards the end of the year, I felt as if I was running out of fuel! I began to feel nervous and demotivated, but through positive self-talk I was able to uplift myself and keep going,\u201d said Avaneshni.\n\n\u201cI reminded myself of the long-term goals that I wanted to achieve. This was a driving force which I used to overcome any hurdles that I experienced.\u201d\n\nAvaneshni explained that her final year at school was \u201cnothing but memorable\u201d, adding that although the highlight was undoubtedly the matric dance, she also thoroughly enjoyed the school\u2019s Evolution Tour to Maropeng.\n\nAnd what does the future hold for this bright and dedicated lass?\n\nFirst step \u2013 a degree in chemical engineering.\n\n\u201cScience has always been a thought-provoking subject and I\u2019m positive that I will enjoy the challenges that come with this course of study.\u201d\n\nWith the degree behind her, Avaneshni plans to travel, with the first stop being the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to my parents and best friend for their love and support. I would not be who I am without the people who have been there for me every step of the way,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTo the matrics of 2020, don\u2019t stop believing in yourself. The things that feel overwhelmingly impossible to do are often the things which one is capable of.\u201d\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY\n\nLike the South Coast Herald\u2019s Facebook page, follow us on Twitter and Instagram\n\nTo receive our FREE email newsletter, click HERE", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["local news", "breaking news", "news headlines", "Port Shepstone", "Port Shepstone News headlines", "Local news", "News", "Top stories", "Special categories", "AVANESHNI Govender", "Scottburgh High", "Vanisha Moodley"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Vanisha Moodley"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan 16 11:02:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://southcoastherald.co.za/wp-content/themes/caxton-ts-v4-tiger/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "local news, breaking news, news headlines, Port Shepstone, Port Shepstone News headlines, Local news, News, Top stories, Special categories, AVANESHNI Govender, Scottburgh High, Vanisha Moodley", "oovvuu": {"id": 390540}, "thumbnail": "https://southcoastherald.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/01/WhatsAppImage2020_68876-520x390.jpeg", "og": {"url": "https://southcoastherald.co.za/390540/six-of-the-best-for-shss-avaneshni/", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Six of the best for SHS's Avaneshni - South Coast Herald", "description": "Reminding herself of her long-term goals kept her going when her motivation dipped.", "site_name": "South Coast Herald", "updated_time": "2020-01-16T11:40:07+02:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://southcoastherald.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/01/WhatsAppImage2020_68876.jpeg", "width": 800, "height": 600}}, "article": {"expiration_time": "2020-01-20T11:02:00+02:00", "tag": "Vanisha Moodley", "section": "Local news", "published_time": "2020-01-16T11:02:00+02:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-16T11:40:07+02:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 729144740491235, "pages": 107309119337392}, "news_keywords": "avaneshni govender, scottburgh high, vanisha moodley, local news, breaking news, news headlines, port shepstone, port shepstone news headlines", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Reminding herself of her long-term goals kept her going when her motivation dipped.", "title": "Six of the best for SHS's Avaneshni - South Coast Herald", "image": "https://southcoastherald.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/01/WhatsAppImage2020_68876.jpeg"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress."}, "canonical_link": "https://southcoastherald.co.za/390540/six-of-the-best-for-shss-avaneshni/"}
