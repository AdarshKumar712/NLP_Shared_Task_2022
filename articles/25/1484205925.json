High schools can start no earlier than 8:30 a.m., and no sooner than 8 a.m. for middle schoolers.\n\nThe controversial measure could be costly, state legislative analysts have said some schools may end up spending millions to accommodate the adjustment.\n\nLimiting and banning smartphone use is at the center of another law affecting schools in 2020.\n\nSchool boards will have the power to ban devices with the exception of emergencies or other special situations, such as medical reasons.\n\nSupporters say smart phone use is linked to lower student performance and interferes with the educational mission of schools.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ashley Zavala", "The Associated Press"], "publish_date": "Fri Dec 27 01:38:07 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "New laws taking effect in 2020 will impact schools across California.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.kron4.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/cropped-KRON4-Favicon-512x512.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "New laws taking effect in 2020 will impact schools across California.", "google-site-verification": "E6zua_1Hx3PqDQT7AXZraHKgjfzBwVxgG6fPV6wzriM", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "fb": {"pages": 76378187097}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "California public schools can\u2019t suspend students for disobeying teachers, new law says", "url": "https://www.kron4.com/news/california/california-public-schools-cant-suspend-students-for-disobeying-teachers-new-law-says/", "description": "New laws taking effect in 2020 will impact schools across California.", "site_name": "KRON4", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.kron4.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/A068E81D49BC4B678DB9EC03EE024923.jpg?w=510&h=286&crop=1&resize=1280,720", "secure_url": "https://www.kron4.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/A068E81D49BC4B678DB9EC03EE024923.jpg?w=510&h=286&crop=1&resize=1280,720"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2019-12-27T01:38:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-12-27T01:38:10+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "California public schools can\u2019t suspend students for disobeying teachers, new law says"}, "image": "https://www.kron4.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/A068E81D49BC4B678DB9EC03EE024923.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "California public schools can\u2019t suspend students for disobeying teachers, new law says", "description": "New laws taking effect in 2020 will impact schools across California."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.kron4.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/cropped-KRON4-Favicon-512x512.png?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.kron4.com/news/california/california-public-schools-cant-suspend-students-for-disobeying-teachers-new-law-says/"}
