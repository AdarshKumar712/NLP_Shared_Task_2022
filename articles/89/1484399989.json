This amount is nearly twice the $8,900 raised last year that fully funded 20 cases. Some people have given every week and one donor has contributed $5,000.\n\nFor the third year in a row, the Norwalk Hour and Family & Children\u2019s Agency have partnered to offer a chance for local families or groups to sponsor someone less fortunate for the holiday season. The Giving Fund features local residents who need a little bit of cash to help buy gifts, visit relatives or just need a little help to make ends meet.\n\nEach case includes an estimated dollar amount that would help the clients face everyday challenges like rent payments, child care costs and transportation. Every dollar donated to the Giving Fund goes directly to the clients in need. The families and individuals who benefit from the Giving Fund often don\u2019t know they have been submitted, and aliases are used in the published stories to protect privacy and dignity.\n\nAnd though the season is ending, many are still in need. These are the last set of cases for this season\u2019s Giving Fund. To donate, use the coupon in the Hour\u2019s print edition or contribute online.\n\nHere are this week\u2019s people who need help:\n\n250: Grace is the mother of four boys and escaped an abusive relationship two years ago. One of her boys has significant learning disabilities, and while the school has recommended occupational therapy, Grace has no way to financially provide these services. She is working with an educational advocate, but a gift of $400 would help her start the therapy her son needs.\n\n251: Jade is a young girl who was recently placed in foster care. Since she is new to the foster home, a gift of $200 will help the family provide comfort items for her as she adjusts during the winter season.\n\n252: Faith lives with her baby boy in her sister's Norwalk home. She has struggled to find employment. It\u2019s difficult for her to provide for her son and she has to walk to appointments with him because she does not have a car. A gift of $300 would allow Faith to get a stroller and some warm clothes so she can more safely walk as the weather gets cold.\n\n253: Candace is a single mother of three girls. She recently had heart surgery and though she was able to go home from the hospital, she remains very fragile. The family was forced to move in with Candace's disabled mother. Candace has no source of income because she had to stop working. Candace also has medical appointments at Yale, and would benefit from a gift of $350 to help pay for the transportation to see cardiac specialists in New Haven.\n\n254: Claire is a senior living in Norwalk. Due to significant health issues, her husband lives in a skilled nursing facility. This has caused a significant reduction in her monthly income, making it difficult for her to meet monthly expenses. In the winter, it can be hard for Claire to cover the cost of home heating oil. A gift of $350 would help her manage this winter expense.\n\n255: Hazel's landlord is selling the home she rents, and finding a new place has been difficult. Hazel's daughter uses a wheelchair and many affordable apartments are not accessible. Fortunately, she found an apartment, but the family lacks the resources for a security deposit and to rent a moving truck. Hazel has worked with a community resource to fund part of the move, but a gift of $500 would make sure Hazel and her daughter can safely move to their new home.\n\n256: Amelia is a single mother of four children in Norwalk. She has struggled with physical and mental health issues and is unemployed. She has been working to find community resources for her family to better meet the needs of her children. A gift of $325 will help purchase food and warm clothing for the winter.\n\n257: Valerie cares for her 3- and 4-year-old granddaughters who were placed in her care due to their mother's drug abuse. Valerie works full-time and had to immediately buy beds, clothes, and other necessities for the children in addition to enrolling them in day care. She hasn't received financial assistance for the girls, and now they are in jeopardy of being removed from day care due to nonpayment. Valerie needs her grandchildren in day care so she can keep her job. A gift of $500 would help keep the girls in day care and buy the essentials they need.\n\n258: April is a single mother of five children, ages 2 to 18. She was working full-time to support her large family, but recently lost her job. Being unemployed has drained her savings and she is now struggling to pay her bills and has been forced to choose between paying the electric bill or getting gas to drive the children to school. A gift of $350 would help April pay the utilities this winter as she hunts for a new job.\n\n259: Neveah is 15 years old and in foster care. She has autism spectrum disorder and is primarily non-verbal. She communicates with signs, photos and simple phrases. A gift of $500 will help support Neveah through developmental learning by providing cognitively appropriate toys, tools and experiences.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "ispremium": 0, "dc.date": "2020-01-01T05:00:00Z", "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T05:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T15:18:11Z", "opinion": "false"}, "SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "news_keywords": "Jade, Candace, Grace, Hazel, Neveah, Claire, Valerie, Amelia, Norwalk, New Haven, Norwalk Hour, Children's Agency, Faith, Yale, Giving Fund, $400", "nlpOrganization": "Norwalk Hour, Children's Agency, Faith, Yale", "nlpPerson": "Jade, Candace, Grace, Hazel, Neveah, Claire, Valerie, Amelia", "nlpLocation": "Norwalk, New Haven", "nlpOther": "Giving Fund, $400", "nlpCategories": "%2FPeople+%26+Society%2FSocial+Issues+%26+Advocacy%2FCharity+%26+Philanthropy,%2FHealth%2FNursing%2FAssisted+Living+%26+Long+Term+Care", "og": {"title": "Holiday donations to Norwalk-area families in need nearly doubles in 2019", "description": "Here are the last 10 cases in this season's Giving Fund, which has raised more than $16,000 so far.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thehour.com/givingfund/article/Holiday-donations-to-Norwalk-area-families-in-14943273.php", "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/05/16/30/18146822/19/rawImage.jpg", "site_name": "The Hour"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thehour", "creator": "@erin_kayata"}, "fb": {"admins": 100006394927810, "app_id": 1543205319318257, "pages": "105702905593,307851324523,12852567813,480760515417232,288240529145,316774245761,984197758297116,7457442370,207033189701,207346283795,222959748728,207042068180,72983690774,339413234035,343689323559,345828366626,234821559861394,335699426867,10150105039485602,338983127562,364516539001,337922332042,115637335153191,372011535931,333376634908,127590790608884,141923885872653,655037391286291,320774811368833,1740489152861748,469700473093040,386754203367,556449374478585,340999853450,350771491032,1120648627959218,342017778245,338463361591,138772706196968,1641688532739111,326312697536,353120110016,343366744658,335009494554,347261603104,350924013892,257724773860,361203926417,367174215398,284154645394,334501182354,350279743224,154340691263654,147848678611852,361381078011,362831597677,10150095255780118"}, "msvalidate.01": "9451CA04ABC9D1D5C6419C73B4C4F7B7"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thehour.com/givingfund/article/Holiday-donations-to-Norwalk-area-families-in-14943273.php"}
