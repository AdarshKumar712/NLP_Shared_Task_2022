St. Louis Blues: Somehow, the Blues seem to keep getting better no matter what is thrown at them.\n\n2. Washington Capitals: Even with a few less-than-perfect patches, they\u2019re consistently one of the best teams in the league.\n\n3. Boston Bruins: With point in seven straight games, the Bruins appear to have righted the ship.\n\n4. New York Islanders: They\u2019ve won just two of their last six games and appear to have come back down to earth after an unsustainable run.\n\n5. Colorado Avalanche: They\u2019re fully healthy for the most part finally but have seen their game slide over the past week as well.\n\n6. Philadelphia Flyers: Apparently are good? At least heading into the new year they seem to be.\n\n7. Dallas Stars: This turnaround shouldn\u2019t be so shocking since everyone predicted the Strars would be solid going into the season, but it\u2019s still impressive.\n\n8. Pittsburgh Penguins: Sidney Crosby is coming back soon and the rest of the league should be real worried about that.\n\n9. Toronto Maple Leafs: The Sheldon Keefe era appears to be a success early.\n\n10. Vegas Golden Knights: These are the Golden Knights you were looking for. Some players are finally playing to their ceiling and the result has been a steady improvement on pedestrian first couple of months.\n\n11. Florida Panthers: Noel Acciari can\u2019t do it every night but the Panthers are finding ways to finally play the higher tier of hockey it seemed their roster is capable of.\n\n12. Carolina Hurricanes: Still a confusing team, but boy Dougie Hamilton finally is the guy Bruins fans hoped he was much earlier in the decade.\n\n13. Tampa Bay Lightning: We learned last year not to count teams out too soon, and when they\u2019re as powerful as the Lightning, that should be especially true.\n\n14. Arizona Coyotes: The Hall and \u2018Yotes tour has started to slow down but they\u2019re in the playoff race and have a high upside still.\n\n15. Vancouver Canucks: Imagine where they\u2019d be without Jacob Markstrom carrying the load.\n\n16. Nashville Predators: They had a strong run for a bit that fell short this week as the Preds still try to get back to that playoff level.\n\n17. Columbus Blue Jackets: They have a 10 game point streak and it\u2019s not all against the Capitals, even!\n\n18. Calgary Flames: Way too streaky and most of the streaks aren\u2019t in the W column.\n\n19. New York Rangers: Maybe we were all wrong to write them off so early.\n\n20. Minnesota Wild: Are good?\n\n21. Chicago Blackhawks: Still mired in a well below average season heading into the new year.\n\n22. Winnipeg Jets: If the concern was what happens when Connor Hellebuyck comes back down to earth, we are witnessing that now.\n\n23. Montreal Canadiens: They might be too far in a hole to come back this season if nothing changes there.\n\n24. Buffalo Sabres: The two contests against the Bruins this weekend showed who they really are.\n\n25. Ottawa Senators: Still not as hopeless as we all imagined yet not even close to relevant still.\n\n26. Edmonton Oilers: Now, these ARE the Edmonton Oilers we were looking for.\n\n27. Anaheim Ducks: Yeah they just have nothing going.\n\n28. Los Angeles Kings: The fire sale should happen at any time for a Kings team with plenty to unload.\n\n29. San Jose Sharks: Things haven\u2019t gotten better. Now they\u2019re 2-10 in their past 12 games with no improvement in sight.\n\n30. New Jersey Devils: The season from Hell rolls on.\n\n31. Detroit Red Wings: Still historically bad!
