Now there is a few seconds delay during which Windows 10 shows a black screen before displaying the login prompt.\n\nI am lucky, though, as others have reported worse issues [1, 2, 3] such as Windows 10 not starting at all after installing the update.\n\n\"On the initial download and install my PC hung at 100% for 5 - 10 mins. Afterwards it hung on the welcome screen after restarts. I recovered the PC by running startup recovery in WinRE, it removed the update. I tried again to install it with the same result. I ran sfc/scannow after both attempts, it found and repaired a few things.\"\n\nBlue screen crashes at login\n\nOne enterprise user reported on the Microsoft forums that after installing the KB4535996 cumulative update almost 200 PCs in their organization would crash with blue screens at the login screen.\n\n\"Seeing this issue with about 200 machines. Uninstalling the update doesnt come off cleanly and still gets lock ups on initial boot. \"\n\nIt should be noted that this may be an outlier or something related to software installed in their organization as I am not seeing many reports like this elsewhere.\n\nPerformance issues\n\nOne of our readers submitted a tip this week stating that after installing the KB4535996 update, their system has been having performance issues and once they uninstalled the update it worked properly again.\n\n\"March 2020 - Installed Microsoft cumulative update KB4535996 on Windows 10 Home 64 bit - caused severe machine slowdown, application and website loading delays. Uninstalled update and problem went away.\"\n\nOthers have also reported similar performance issues [1, 2, 3] where Windows 'stutters', frame rates in games have gone down, and reports of high disk usage or thrashing.\n\nSound and audio hardware issues\n\nAfter installing the KB4535996 update, users are reporting [1, 2, 3] that the sound in Windows 10 no longer works.\n\nOne user stated that their problem was related to their Sound Blaster USB device no longer being detected by Windows 10.\n\n\"After this update my Sound Blaster USB Audio cards stopped working, They would not even show up in the Device Manager yet they were properly connected and worked prior to the update.\"\n\nMicrosoft Visual Studio signtool.exe stops working\n\nSince KB4535996 was released, we have had numerous reports about the Visual Studio code-signing tool signtool.exe no longer working.\n\nSigntool.exe is a program that allows you to digitally sign an executable with a code-signing certificate to indicate that the program comes from a specific publisher and has not been tampered with.\n\nAfter installing KB4535996, users are reporting that when they use the tool it generates an error code -1073741502.\n\nAccording to Windows developer Rafael Rivera, this bug is being caused by WTLogConfigCiScriptEvent being removed from wldp.dll.\n\nMicrosoft has stated that they are aware of the issue and are working on a resolution for release in mid-March.\n\n\"We\u2019re aware of issues with signtool.exe after installing the latest optional update for Windows 10, version 1903 or Windows 10, version 1909 (KB4535996). If you are encountering issues or receiving errors related to signtool.exe, you can uninstall the optional update KB4535996. We are working on a resolution and estimate a solution will be available in mid-March.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Boot Issues", "Microsoft", "KB4535996", "Windows Update", "Windows 10", "Crash", "Cumulative Update", "Performance", "Audio"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Since the release of the Windows 10\u00a0KB4535996\u00a0cumulative update, Windows users have been reporting numerous problems including boot issues, crashes, performance problems, audio issues, and developer tools no longer working.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.bleepstatic.com/favicon/bleeping.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "Owner": "Lawrence Abrams/BleepingComputer.com", "og": {"site_name": "BleepingComputer", "locale": "en_us", "url": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-kb4535996-update-issues-crashes-slowdowns-audio-more/", "type": "article", "title": "Windows 10 KB4535996 Update Issues: Crashes, Slowdowns, Audio, More", "description": "Since the release of the Windows 10\u00a0KB4535996\u00a0cumulative update, Windows users have been reporting numerous problems including boot issues, crashes, performance problems, audio issues, and developer tools no longer working.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2019/12/04/Windows_Bug.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2019/12/04/Windows_Bug.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 450}}, "application-name": "BleepingComputer", "Keywords": "computers, windows, linux, mac, support, tech support, spyware, malware, virus, security, Audio, Boot Issues, Crash, Cumulative Update, KB4535996, Microsoft, Performance, Windows 10, Windows Update,virus removal, malware removal, computer help, technical support", "description": "Since the release of the Windows 10\u00a0KB4535996\u00a0cumulative update, Windows users have been reporting numerous problems including boot issues, crashes, performance problems, audio issues, and developer tools no longer working.", "abstract": "Since the release of the Windows 10\u00a0KB4535996\u00a0cumulative update, Windows users have been reporting numerous problems including boot issues, crashes, performance problems, audio issues, and developer tools no longer working.", "news_keywords": "Audio, Boot Issues, Crash, Cumulative Update, KB4535996, Microsoft, Performance, Windows 10, Windows Update", "fb": {"app_id": 517620508265293}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@BleepinComputer", "creator": "@BleepinComputer", "title": "Windows 10 KB4535996 Update Issues: Crashes, Slowdowns, Audio, More", "description": "Since the release of the Windows 10\u00a0KB4535996\u00a0cumulative update, Windows users have been reporting numerous problems including boot issues, crashes, performance problems, audio issues, and developer tools no longer working.", "image": "https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2019/12/04/Windows_Bug.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-kb4535996-update-issues-crashes-slowdowns-audio-more/"}
