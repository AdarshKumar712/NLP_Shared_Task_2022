"text": "Turkish forces have shot down two Syrian jets in northwest Syria, Syria's official news agency reports.\n\nSANA says the jets were targeted over the Idlib region on Sunday, and that the pilots ejected with parachutes and landed safely.\n\nThe announcement came amid a military escalation in Syria's Idlib province that has led to growing direct clashes between Turkish and Syrian forces.\n\nIt also came shortly after Syria announced it was closing its airspace for any flights or drones across the country's northwest.\n\nIt said any aircraft that penetrates Syrian airspace will be treated as hostile and shot down.\n\nOn Saturday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced his country had opened its western borders to migrants and refugees hoping to head into the EU.\n\nThe UN said on Sunday that at least 13,000 people were massed on Turkey's land border with Greece.\n\nErdogan did not explicitly linked his decision to open the gates to Europe to the military escalation in Syria's northwest Idlib province.\n\nHowever, he has warned that Turkey \"can't handle a new wave of migration,\" an apparent reference to Idlib, where hundreds of thousands of desperate Syrian civilians fleeing Syrian troop advances moved toward the Turkish border.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["News", "Conflict and War"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Costas Kantouris", "Andrew
