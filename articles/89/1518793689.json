At the time, most Germans either could not afford them or saw them as a losing financial investment. Fell realized he wanted to find a way to change that, so that his fellow countrymen would invest in renewable technology instead of fossil fuels.\n\nAs a Green party member in Germany\u2019s national parliament, Fell eventually helped create a policy that looks a lot like part of the Green New Deal some Democrats are proposing in the US. His law allowed Germans to sell the renewable energy they create to the grid at a high fixed price \u2014 a price that would more than cover the cost of installing a solar panel, or investing in a wind turbine. Germany paid for this through a surcharge on every electricity consumer\u2019s bill.\n\nFor this episode, The Impact partnered with NPR\u2019s Planet Money to investigate the consequences of Germany\u2019s green push. In some ways, the law succeeded beyond Fell\u2019s wildest dreams. Demand for renewables grew so much in Germany that other countries, including China, started to mass-produce solar panels and wind turbines, which drove down prices. Now, people all over the world can afford this technology.\n\nBut the law has also had some unintended consequences. Because of amendments to the law and technological improvements, the surcharge on Germany\u2019s electric bills have skyrocketed. Now, Germany has the highest electric bills in Europe. Electricity has become a burdensome expense for some Germans living on welfare, and the high cost has left a few spending a lot of time in the dark.\n\nFurther listening and reading:\n\nSubscribe to The Impact on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or your favorite podcast app to automatically get new episodes of the latest season each week.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jillian Weinberger", "Amy Drozdowska", "Byrd Pinkerton", "Ian Millhiser", "Jen Kirby", "Cameron Peters", "Sean Collins", "Aaron Rupar", "Alex Ward", "Jan"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan 22 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "One man, some very old solar panels, and a law that looks a lot like part of the proposed US Green New Deal helped transform the way Germany gets its power.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/community_logos/52517/voxv.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vox", "published_time": "2020-01-22T08:40:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-22T08:40:00-05:00"}, "author": "Jillian Weinberger", "style-tools": "https://www.vox.com/style/community/441/4d365fb8c7edb584b73ae31bb1cba0b4/tools.css", "p": {"domain_verify": "d4410485bd6277c2bf2ce0f277819dc6"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "One man, some very old solar panels, and a law that looks a lot like part of the proposed US Green New Deal helped transform the way Germany gets its power.", "og": {"description": "One man, some very old solar panels, and a law that looks a lot like part of the proposed US Green New Deal helped transform the way Germany gets its power.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ItMIcSLsP632grksjZErcYD4Vxo=/0x0:4032x2111/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19577842/HJF_with_solar_panels.jpg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Vox", "title": "How Germany helped make renewable energy cheap for the rest of the world", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vox.com/2020/1/22/21028914/germany-green-new-deal-solar-power"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.vox.com/2020/1/22/21028914/germany-green-new-deal-solar-power", "title": "How Germany helped make renewable energy cheap for the rest of the world", "description": "One man, some very old solar panels, and a law that looks a lot like part of the proposed US Green New Deal helped transform the way Germany gets its power.", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qwd3UtA7bpsuHY_L0BsDAEOcvwg=/0x0:4032x2016/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19577842/HJF_with_solar_panels.jpg", "site": "voxdotcom"}, "sailthru.title": "How Germany helped make renewable energy cheap for the rest of the world", "sailthru.tags": "general,vox,front-page,energy-and-environment,podcasts,renewable-energy,the-impact", "sailthru.description": "One man, some very old solar panels, and a law that looks a lot like part of the proposed US Green New Deal helped transform the way Germany gets its power.", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-22T08:40:00-05:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Aj42EztIBbfF0KZxiuewNCHTLY=/0x0:4032x2268/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66144163/HJF_with_solar_panels.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qHJUHQ8N0w5OG76WtDyOP0gY_Vs=/0x0:3024x3024/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66144163/HJF_with_solar_panels.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/hub/sbnu_logo_minimal/441/touch_icon_ipad_retina_1000_yellow.755.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#4f7177", "outbrainsection": "the-impact"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/2020/1/22/21028914/germany-green-new-deal-solar-power"}
