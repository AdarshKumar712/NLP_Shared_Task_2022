Amid widespread concerns about his mental fitness, Biden can\u2019t go seven minutes without putting his foot in his mouth. He\u2019s in no condition to beat Trump.pic.twitter.com/Vd8rJhuzeG \u2014 Samuel D. Finkelstein II (@CANCEL_SAM) March 7, 2020\n\nThe \u201chelp, mommy!\u201d look at the end was the pitiful cherry on top. Biden\u2019s main problem (on top of his real problems) is that he tries to \u201cpower through\u201d his incoherence, and only winds up even more incoherent. This is nothing short of elder abuse by the people pushing him to run \u2014 monkeyfresh (@monkeyfresh1) March 8, 2020\n\nThis is cruel. I care about the humanity of a person before I do about politics. It\u2019s mean, his family letting him be out there on the campaign when he is dealing with something mentally. Let him rest. Take it easy. Get help for what he\u2019s going through mentally. God bless him. \u2014 Adam R Alb (@AdamRAlb) March 8, 2020\n\n370 million people in this country, about half of which are Democrats, and THIS is the best person the Democratic Party could choose to represent them? Seriously? Trump is going to kill this guy in the debates. \u2014 Tom Nicholas (@TomNicholas529) March 7, 2020\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t have a script to read, he falls apart. What is wrong with Democrats? The thought of @JoeBiden making any significant decision is frightening. \u2014 MountainMama66\ud83c\udf3f (@mountain_mama66) March 8, 2020", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Gaffe", "Joe Biden"], "authors": ["Barracuda Brigade"], "publish_date": "Sun Mar  8 15:49:32 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Did Biden just endorse Trump ? \u201cWe cannot re-elect \u2013 we cannot win this re-election.
