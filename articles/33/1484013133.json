Mr Hutton added that the government also needed to control \u201cpersons rebuilding sub-standard accommodations\u201d, and prevent them from \u201crebuilding in places where they shouldn\u2019t be, and repairing structures that may not be structurally sound\u201d.\n\nMr Hutton said his message to the government was \u201cto encourage them to get a move on\u201d, while acknowledging that the sort of rebuilding plan required by Abaco takes time to develop and will not materialise overnight.\n\nThe Abaco Chamber chief said more than 80 percent of homes in central Abaco have been destroyed by Hurricane Dorian, and added: \u201cThe housing situation is precarious at best. They are being repaired, but are they being repaired to the standard? Is there mould remediation taking place? Are they adhering to a better building code, or are people just putting things together just to move into somewhere?\u201d\n\nMr Hutton, though, backed the government\u2019s intention to make crown land available for the development of housing subdivisions so Abaconians can rebuild. \u201cI think it is an excellent idea for the government to make crown land available for subdivisions,\u201d he added, suggesting it can help control the \u201cwayward construction\u201d that may occur as a result of the current situation.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Abaco Chamber of Commerce\u2019s president yesterday urged the government to \u201cget a move on\u201d in developing a comprehensive plan for the island\u2019s post-Hurricane Dorian revival.
