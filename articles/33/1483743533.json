Among the many anti-national acts that the police had cited, it also said that there was a plot hatched to kill the Prime Minister.\n\nIn a 5,000-page charge sheet, the Pune police spoke about an assassination plot that was hatched by the naxalites.\n\nIn the charge sheet filed, the police said that some of the naxal leaders were conspiring to kill the PM and had planned on procuring arms and ammunition with an intention of waging war against the country.\n\nBhima-Koregaon Anniversary: Maharashtra braces for historic day, security heightened\n\nThe police also said that the Maoists are trying to mobilise and incite Dalits and the Elgar Parishad conclave in Pune last December as part of this strategy.\n\nNEWS AT NOON JAN 1st, 2020\n\nThe Maoist-backed conclave \"aggravated\" the violence at Koregaon Bhima on January 1, the charge sheet said.\n\nThe over 5,000-page charge sheet named 10 persons, including activists Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Shoma Sen, Rona Wilson and Sudhir Dhavale, all arrested on June 6.\n\nBesides, it named five Maoist leaders believed to be underground: Dipak alias Milind Teltumbade, Kishan Da alias Prashant Bose, Prakash alias Rituparn Goswami, Deepu and Manglu.\n\n\"Maoist leaders including...Rona Wilson and fugitive Kishan Da were conspiring the assassination of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and waging war against the country for which they were planning to procure arms and ammunition,\" it stated.\n\nThe police cited several documents seized from the Maoist leaders to make the claim on Modi's assassination plan.\n\nThe larger conspiracy of CPI (Maoists) was to overthrow the democratic system in the country, and the accused were working in that direction, the charge sheet claimed.\n\nThe charge sheet, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and IPC, was filed in the court of District & Sessions Judge Kishor D Vadane here.\n\nThe Elgar Parishad had been organised with \"inspiration, money and directions\" of Maoists, it alleged.\n\nAfter Uddhav assures to drop Bhima-Koregaon cases, BJP asks is this Bal Thackeray\u2019s Shiv Sena\n\n\"It is the policy of the CPI (Maoists)... to mobilise Dalit community's sentiments and mislead them and provoke them to take violent path against the system,\" it said.\n\n\"As a part of this strategy, Sudhir Dhavale and other members of Kabir Kala Manch (KKM, a cultural group) spread hatred by giving inciting speeches, presenting distorted history and staging provocative skits and songs,\" it said.\n\nOn the directions of CPI (Maoists) Dhavale and KKM, under the banner of Bhima-Koregaon Shaurya Din Prerana Abhiyan, galvanised Dalit organisations and organised Elgar Parishad on December 31, the charge sheet said.\n\n\"During the conclave, inciting speeches were made, inflammatory songs and street plays were played...all these things aggravated the violence on January 1, 2018, at Bhima Koregaon (in Pune district) during 200th commemoration of Bhima Koregaon battle,\" it said.\n\nAssistant Commissioner of Police Shivaji Pawar, the investigating officer, said Pune Police recorded the statement of surrendered Maoist leader Pahad Singh.\n\n\"Singh gave details of Milind Teltumbade's role.

The charge sheet does not name them.\n\nDalits at a commemoration event of the Bhima Koregaon battle -- in which the forces of the Peshwa, ruler of Pune, were defeated by the British East India Company -- came under attack on January 1.\n\nWhile Dalits see the victory as an assertion of their identity as the British forces included Mahar (a formerly untouchable caste) soldiers, some Hindu right-wing organisations were opposed to the celebration.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Happy New Year 2020", "bhima koregaon", "Reviews", "narendra modi", "More BHIMA KOREGAON News", "Narendra Modi", "assassination"], "authors": ["Oi-Vicky Nanjappa"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 10:42:36 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Maharashtra braces for the Bhima Koregaon Anniversary.
