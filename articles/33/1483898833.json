who can't be named for legal reasons - said she supported a campaign to shun the holiday spot saying she believes the resort of Ayia Napa is unsafe.\n\n7 The teen's mother has labelled parts of Cyprus unsafe following her daughter's conviction\n\n\"The place isn't safe - it is absolutely not safe,\" she told Radio 4's Today programme after labelling the court's verdict \"absolutely astonishing\".\n\n\"And if you go and report something that's happened to you, you're either laughed at, as far as I can tell, or, in the worst case, something like what's happened to my daughter may happen,\"\n\nThe teenager said she was raped by up to 12 Israeli tourists in a hotel room in the party town on July 17.\n\nBut she was charged and the dozen young men, aged between 15 and 20, who were arrested over the incident, were freed after she signed a retraction statement 10 days later.\n\nThe woman said her daughter is experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hallucinations, and is sleeping for up to 20 hours a day because of a condition called hypersomnia.\n\n\"She needs to get back to the UK to get that treated - that's my absolute primary focus.\n\n\"She can't be treated here because hearing foreign men speaking loudly will trigger an episode.\n\n7 The Brit teen faces jail after being found guilty of making a false gang rape accusation in Cyprus Credit: Louis Wood - The Sun\n\n7 The teen and her mum wore masks with stitches on the lips in protest at her treatment as they left court\n\n\"It needs resolving otherwise she's going to carry on having this for the rest of her life,\" the woman said.\n\nShe said her daughter had planned to go to university this year after being accepted for the courses she applied for and being offered a bursary at one institute.\n\n\"So, no question, she would have gone to university, but it was in a career that she wouldn't be able to do with this 'public mischief' verdict, so - again, life-changing for her - she needs to totally rethink her options.\"\n\nA crowdfunding appeal to raise money for legal support for her daughter has passed \u00a380,000.\n\nThe \"help teen victim get justice in Cyprus\" GoFundMe page was set up by British lawyer John Hobbs in August to raise cash for the 19-year-old's legal representation.\n\nThe teenager claimed in court she was raped but forced to change her account under pressure from Cypriot police.\n\n7 Ayia Napa is a magnet for young Brits looking for fun in the sun Credit: Jamie Lorriman - The Sun\n\n7 The hotel room where the woman claimed the assault took place\n\nThe Foreign Office said the UK was \"seriously concerned\" about the fairness of the woman's trial and it is understood officials have raised the \"deeply distressing case\" with the Cypriot authorities.\n\nHer mother said she would \"definitely\" like the British government to intervene in the case.\n\nShe told Radio 4: \"I would love the Foreign Secretary to get involved, that would be fantastic.\"\n\nShe said they will be appealing against the verdict \"without question\" and hoped the FCO could help them progress the case to the Cypriot Supreme Court.\n\nShe added: \"Unfortunately there's quite a long waiting list, so our lawyers are looking at what could be done to expedite that.\n\n\"That's something maybe the Foreign Office can help us with.\"\n\n7 The Israeli suspects were released without charge and returned home Credit: AP:Associated Press\n\n7 Supporters of the teenager waved banners and wore stitched-lip masks outside the court Credit: EPA\n\nLawyers and campaigners criticised the justice system after she was convicted of public mischief at Famagusta District Court, in Paralimni, on Monday.\n\nThere are now reports some of those originally accused of the attack have friends in high places.\n\nWhile the boys\u2019 identities have not been released because they were minors at the time, some of their parents appear to be close to the Israeli establishment, it's claimed.\n\nOne of their fathers is even an adviser to an important mayor, reports the Times.\n\nIt reports there is now the impression that the 12 had at least some backing from powerful figures.\n\nHowever, the government of Cyprus has said it has \"full confidence in the justice system and the courts\".\n\nMOST READ IN NEWS 'THEY'RE DEAD' Couple stabbed to death 'by ex in 4am knife rampage as witnesses screamed' BLOODY RIDDLE Caroline Flack\u2019s boyfriend claims it\u2019s NOT his blood on her bed in horror pic Exclusive HALF WAYNE LINE Wayne Rooney builds full-size footie pitch at his \u00a320m 'Morrisons Mansion' Exclusive BEDROOM BLOODBATH Shocking pic shows Caroline Flack's blood-soaked bed after 'lamp attack' BEER WE GO!
