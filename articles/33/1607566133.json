The Conservative win halted the market uncertainty that had been weighing it down, but as the reality of a \u2018Boris Brexit\u2019 becomes ever more real, I think the fallout for British business will be clear.\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability themes have been at the front of investors\u2019 minds as increasing concerns around climate change moved up a gear or two in 2019. Raging Australian bushfires, Greta Thunberg meeting Sir David Attenborough and Mark Carney\u2019s keynote speech warning big business to take responsibility before it\u2019s too late, mean that we\u2019ve ended the year with the climate emergency remaining headline news.\n\nThe pressure is on for capitalism to help prevent an almighty climate disaster and for companies to govern in a responsible way, creating opportunities, while improving lives and the environment.\n\nYet as investors, we shouldn\u2019t forget that crisis brings opportunity. All of which causes me to consider some companies I think could go the distance in 2020 and prosper in a world more focused on ethical and sustainability issues.\n\nFTSE 100 favourite\n\nUnilever (LSE:ULVR) is a FTSE 100 consumer goods specialist with many household brands under its banner include Dove soap, Surf detergent and Knorr.\n\nIt\u2019s considered a relatively safe stock to own, with its regular 3% dividend yield and plentiful supply of brands that consumers love to buy on repeat. It\u2019s also a feel-good stock as it has championed alternatives to animal testing for over 30 years and in November it received the US Corporate Consciousness Award for industry-leading work to end animal testing.\n\nIt\u2019s committed to sustainability and the environment too. It unveiled reusable packaging innovations a year ago. Last month it announced that it has partnered with speciality chemicals company Evonik to create an environmentally friendly cleaning ingredient, Rhamnolipid.\n\nIt has an \u00a3114bn market cap, price-to-earnings ratio of 17, earnings per share of \u00a32.53 and its continued growth prospects look good too as it has considerable exposure to emerging markets such as Asia, Brazil and India.\n\nA sweeter future\n\nAssociated British Foods (LSE:ABF) aims to provide safe, nutritious food and affordable clothing through its recognisable brands such as Twinings, Dorset Cereals, Ryvita, and Silver Spoon sugar along with its high street favourite retailer Primark.\n\nThe company has a \u00a321bn market cap, trailing P/E of 23 and earnings per share are \u00a31.11. Its dividend yield is 1.8%.\n\nDespite (or perhaps because of) its Primark operation having been criticised from ethical and sustainable viewpoints in the past, in its 2019 responsibility report, it outlines its ethical business practices. It\u2019s working to reduce its carbon footprint, use natural resources efficiently and promote biodiversity.\n\nAt its December AGM, it predicted another year of strong profit and margin growth in its grocery brands. Although its sugar division brought profits down in recent years when an oversupply problem caused prices to be suppressed, this seems to be taking a turn for the better and increasing demand is expected to increase prices in 2020.\n\nI like both these companies as potential 2020 buys as they\u2019re long-standing businesses with a catalogue of well-known brands and FTSE 100 status. I also think they\u2019ll stand strong in post-Brexit Britain.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["ABF", "ULVR"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://1gb82h2px4rr3s7tp94g0nt1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/freesite-theme/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "industry": "Consumer Discretionary,Consumer Staples", "investing_topic": "Brexit", "person": "Boris Johnson", "demographic": "Middle Age,Millennials,Retirees", "article_type": "Top Shares", "fb": {"app_id": 141414192577163}, "og": {"url": "https://www.fool.co.uk/investing/2020/01/01/which-stocks-should-i-buy-in-2020/", "title": "Which stocks should I buy in 2020?", "image": "https://1gb82h2px4rr3s7tp94g0nt1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Charts.jpg", "description": "I like the look of these FTSE 100 companies for 2020 investments as they seem to be focusing on what matters to their customers.", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Motley Fool UK"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01"}, "news_keywords": "Investing Articles, The Motley Fool UK"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.fool.co.uk/investing/2020/01/01/which-stocks-should-i-buy-in-2020/"}
