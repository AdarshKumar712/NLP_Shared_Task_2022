REUTERS/Michele Tantussi\n\nDHL will launch live tracking of parcels this year, allowing recipients to see when they will be delivered via an app, which will show on a map where the delivery van is and allow them to say where they want a parcel left if they are not at home.\n\nGerman post offices have been overwhelmed by the explosion of ecommerce, with customers often forced to wait in long lines to send or collect a parcel or buy a stamp.\n\nDeutsche Post DHL also faces increasing competition, including from Amazon, which is building up its own logistics service in Germany, already offering customers the ability to track parcels.\n\nDHL will also make it easier for customers to frank return parcels, including at the company's 24,000 post offices, 4,500 locker stations or with a postal worker at their front door.\n\nThe company plans to increase the number of locker stations to 7,000 by 2021 and has developed a machine where customers can send letters and parcels and buy stamps round the clock, with a video chat function also being piloted.\n\nThe company is cooperating with two companies - GMX and WEB.DE - to allow customers to get advance notice of letters, with the envelopes being photographed in sorting centres and emailed to recipients.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["code", "Germany", "Deutsche Post DHL", "postage", "app", "stamp"], "tags": ["Germany", "stamp", "postage", "app", "Deutsche Post DHL", "code"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "BERLIN: German logistics company Deutsche Post DHL announced plans on Tuesday (Mar 3) to allow customers to pay for postage by app and write a ...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/image/8395694/1x1/57/57/755b75f6028a7f36cbbf113727506192/Fd/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "gcqKpYH6dKkhC5wY6P-YBN9YKjoYiXuPzAGLxnPglWk", "msvalidate.01": "C897C7AC0C0688E10CE5A2B45767B86C", "keywords": "code,Germany,Deutsche Post DHL,postage,app,stamp", "news_keywords": "code,Germany,Deutsche Post DHL,postage,app,stamp", "description": "BERLIN: German logistics company Deutsche Post DHL announced plans on Tuesday (Mar 3) to allow customers to pay for postage by app and write a ...", "fb": {"app_id": 1866941073551235}, "og": {"site_name": "CNA", "title": "A blow for stamp collectors?
