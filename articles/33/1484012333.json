The suit charges that Jones\u2019 peddling of a conspiracy theory that the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre was a hoax created by the federal government defames the parents of the murdered children by calling them \u201ccrisis actors.\u201d Not only is this claim morally repugnant, but the parents say it\u2019s led to real-life threats and harassment.\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2012, a gunman shot and killed 20 children and six adults at the school in Newtown, Connecticut. Jones previously told the viewers of his show that the shooting was a hoax, though he has since said in a sworn deposition that he now believes the shooting was real. He says that a \u201cform of psychosis\u201d made him question whether the mass shooting was real.\n\nNeil Heslin, the father of one of the children killed in Newtown, brought the defamation case against Jones and his website. Heslin says that he\u2019s received numerous death threats from people who bought into Jones\u2019 conspiracy theory. He sued Jones in April 2018, as did other families.\n\nAs reported by The New York Times, Judge Jenkins said Jones\u2019 and his website\u2019s lack of cooperation in the case \u201cshould be treated as contempt of court.\u201d Jenkins also denied a motion from Jones and InfoWars to dismiss the case in a separate ruling. The Daily Beast reports that the fees break down to $65,825 for ignoring a court order to procure witnesses and documents and $34,323 to cover Heslin\u2019s legal fees. Mind you, the case itself hasn\u2019t even gone to trial yet.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Religious Right"], "authors": ["Marissa Higgins", "Daily Kos"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 15:09:33 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet.org", "title": "Far-right host Alex Jones ordered to pay $100,000 in Sandy Hook defamation case", "url": "https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/far-right-host-alex-jones-ordered-to-pay-100000-in-sandy-hook-defamation-case/", "type": "article", "description": "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of InfoWars notoriety has been\u00a0ordered\u00a0by Texas Judge Scott Jenkins to pay $100,000 in court costs and legal fees as part of a defamation lawsuit.
