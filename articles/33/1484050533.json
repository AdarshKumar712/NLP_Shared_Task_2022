The 2020s are here, and with this brand new decade come new challenges and technologies that will change the way we live. In the past, Digital Trends has celebrated the passing of each year by issuing predictions for the year ahead, but for this New Year\u2019s, we peered into our crystal ball to imagine what the coming decade will bring.\n\nWhile our predictions might seem lofty and perhaps even pulled from science fiction, they\u2019re all based on technologies either already available or in development right now. It\u2019s not a question of if these will come to fruition, but when. So what tech will change your life this decade? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nSpace Exploration\n\nThe 2020s will mark the return of humans to space missions beyond the Earth\u2019s orbit. There is the possibility that humans might not only set foot on the moon, but also on Mars within the next decade. Of the two, a return to the moon is far more likely \u2014 with humans establishing a permanent lunar settlement by the end of the decade.\n\nNASA currently targets 2024 for the Artemis III mission that will put humans back on the lunar surface and a permanent settlement by 2028. However, humans could orbit the moon by the end of this year or early 2021. As for Mars, that\u2019s much more difficult. While SpaceX has repeatedly stated it\u2019s on target to put humans on Mars by the end of the decade, whether that\u2019s even possible depends on the success of the company\u2019s human-crewed lunar missions, which should happen in the mid-2020s. Regardless, humans are returning to space to stay this time. But it\u2019s not just astronauts that will be in space anymore.\n\nSpace Tourism\n\nThe idea of space tourism is nothing new, and various companies have promised to make it a reality for about as long as humans have been in space. But in the 2020s, it will become a reality. Both Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic and the Jeff Bezos-backed Blue Origin will begin offering near-space flights in the early 2020s \u2014 but at a high price tag, somewhere in the range of $250,000 per person. SpaceX is targeting 2023 to fly Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa and a group of artists around the moon. The cost is unknown, but Maezawa is likely paying millions (if not tens of millions) of dollars.\n\nBut Branson and Bezos have both publicly stated that they don\u2019t want to limit spaceflight to the super-rich. And Elon Musk has also proposed plans for a system of rocket-based travel that could theoretically get you to any point in the world within an hour \u2014 all for the price of an economy airline ticket. While there\u2019s reason to be skeptical of Musk\u2019s proposal, it\u2019s fairly likely that by the end of the decade a flight on a space-bound plane might cost little more than a first-class ticket.\n\nThe Rebirth of Public Transit\n\nU.S. public transportation sucks. There\u2019s no nice way to put it. The reason? Americans love their cars. In automobiles per capita, the United States ranks fourth. It also ranks fourth in terms of time citizens spend in congestion, too. But that\u2019s not all: our increasingly sprawling metropolitan areas are giving birth to the \u201csuper commuter,\u201d those of us traveling 90 or more minutes a day to work, whose numbers have skyrocketed in recent years. It\u2019s time for America to get serious about public transit.\n\nThe 2020s should see several new bullet trains begin service across the country. Commuting via air will become affordable, and if companies like Uber have their way, you\u2019ll likely be on one of these flights in just a few short years. But perhaps the most exciting is the Hyperloop. If everything goes right, we should have the first functioning Hyperloop system from Abu Dhabi to Dubai in the early 2020s, followed by other small projects throughout the decade. That\u2019s pretty exciting.\n\nMass Automation\n\nThe worldwide labor force will have a reckoning this decade. Technology is now at a point where many tasks can be performed faster and more efficiently by robots. With the dawn of AI, these robots can operate themselves, further eliminating the need for humans in the process. With self-driving cars and drones, the cargo transportation industry will also increasingly automate itself. During the 2020s, automation will become the rule, not the exception \u2014 potentially putting a quarter of current jobs at risk of elimination by 2030.\n\nThis apparently inevitable job apocalypse has even become a 2020 election year campaign issue, ask Andrew Yang. But Yang won\u2019t be the last. Expect to hear a lot more about this in the years to come. Either way, we\u2019ll have to figure out just how much automation we\u2019re willing to accept, and what to do with the millions that will lose their jobs as a result. It\u2019s not an easy problem to solve.\n\nThe Last Mass-Produced Gas Vehicle\n\nIt seems like the automobile industry has been overselling the idea of electric cars for much of the 21st Century, and that\u2019s pretty accurate. While the electric vehicle has been around for decades, it wasn\u2019t until the 2010s that technology was able to produce an electric vehicle with a mass-market appeal \u2014 the Tesla. The company arguably sparked a massive push towards electrification, and likely so much so that by the end of the decade, an overwhelming majority of new cars sold will be all-electric.\n\nBy mid-decade, a majority of cars sold will either be hybrid or electric. At least one manufacturer, Volkswagen, hopes to be all-electric by 2026. Volvo hopes to be there much sooner, perhaps as early as 2021. By the end of the decade, the last gas-powered vehicle will likely have rolled off the assembly lines. But with all this electrification comes the question of how to keep all those cars charged up \u2014 which our current system would not be able to handle.\n\nA Cure for Cancer and AIDS\n\nWe are so tantalizingly close to a cure for two of the most vexing diseases of the past several decades: cancer and AIDS. While we\u2019ve been told numerous times over the years that a cure is near, we\u2019ve only found successful ways to put certain types of cancer into into remission or simply hold AIDS at bay for a while \u2014 not an outright cure for either. But the 2020s may finally see a legitimate treatment for both diseases, potentially saving millions of lives in the process.\n\nWith cancer, a radical new treatment called CAR-T is showing great promise, and other companies are claiming similar success. With AIDS, Temple University and University of Nebraska researchers have successfully eliminated HIV-1 from the genomes of living animals. With this success, these two deadly diseases will likely be a thing of the past by decade\u2019s end. And that\u2019s not all \u2014 several other conditions may become much rarer, and those born in this decade will likely by and large make it into the 22nd Century healthier than aging generations before it.\n\nHuman Augmentation\n\nWe\u2019re not talking about full-blown cyborgs here. But technologies are currently in development to extend human capabilities, even to those that may not have had them in the first place. Robotic limbs that can be controlled by thought will become much more commonplace, giving freedom back to amputees and paraplegics. Technologies that connect our brains to computers are in development is well, and will likely be available by mid-decade.\n\nComputer chips may be embedded in our skin to allow us to identify ourselves, open doors (our own Drew Prindle\u2019s already done it), and control all types of devices. It\u2019s a pretty exciting thought, but could it also open up all kinds of questions as to when and what is acceptable when it comes to human augmentation.\n\nEditors' Recommendations", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Robots Everywhere", "MacOS", "Car Reviews", "Genius Home", "Space", "Original Shows", "Versus", "Windows Reviews", "Fintech", "Xbox", "Google", "SpaceX", "Power of Collaboration", "iPhone and iPad Reviews", "Tesla", "More Original Series", "Better, Stronger, Faster", "Nintendo Switch", "PC Gaming", "Mac Reviews", "The Future Of", "Amazon", "Streaming Guides", "PlayStation", "Life on Mars", "Streaming Media"], "authors": ["Ed Oswald", "January"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 11:00:09 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A new decade is here.
