By any conceivable standard, she has had a sparkling career. As Speaker of the House under Obama it was her that carried home, in just over a year, every major legislative accomplishment the Obama administration was known for , most famously the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. In other timelines less bizarre, one might reasonably have expected such an achievement to be the cornerstone of their legacy. In this one, it\u2019s only half. And by the time it\u2019s all been said and done, it may be much less.\n\nFor now, her memory will be inextricably tied to a slob with nary an accomplishment at all, other than having been born rich and a guy who real players could exploit- Donald Trump, the man she just impeached.\n\nPelosi never wanted this . It wasn\u2019t the plan in the beginning. I know; I have written many articles that were meant to help tamp down talk of impeachment. The most recent was in June- before Ukrainegate broke. The far-left wanted us to destroy ourselves by impeaching post- Mueller Report , of course, but real Democrats were not so eager. Not because Trump was innocent, but because we didn\u2019t have enough evidence to make worthwhile a course of action that could tear apart the country. We knew everyone on the right would go nuts, and they\u2019ve got all the force. We knew Trump would not go peacefully, that on the honor scale he had even less than Richard Nixon- an almost-bottomless pit. I didn\u2019t see a scenario likely to end well, and I still don\u2019t.\n\nBut after the Ukrainegate scandal broke, less than six months after Russiagate\u2019s unsatisfying \u201cend\u201d, growing unrest among the people matched the one of unease in the hearts of the Congress. What Trump had done, withholding Congressionally-approved military aid to an ally at war with our bitterest global rival, Russia, in order to gain an advantage on Joe Biden \u2013 who will probably be our next President- was so far beyond anything Nixon had ever done that it defied the very comparison as facile.\n\nWhen we retook the House of Representatives in the Blue Wave last fall, Trump\u2019s corruption was a big reason why. Three hundred million Americans have been dealing with unease about whether or not our president worked for Russia\u2019s, whether he\u2019s insane, whether he\u2019s a Nazi destroying our system. One of the main reasons we Democrats were given the power by the American people to impeach this unfit president after the Blue Wave was just this.\n\nIf we didn\u2019t impeach him in the face of lawlessness this extreme, our children would have grown up knowing in America, the law does not exist. Nancy Pelosi, whose responsibility it was to begin the process of removing him from office, will have to bear the burden of these tiring and weighty events. So we\u2019re going to support her. It is our duty and pleasure alike.\n\nOne can hope, of course, but I knew it would come to this. There was never a doubt in my mind. Trump is a crook, he\u2019s always been a crook, but he\u2019s not bad at lying about it to people who want to believe him. Republican arguments about how the American people had \u201cvetted\u201d him take no notice of reality or reason. But it wasn\u2019t the same for all Americans. Some people seemed to really believe you could count on Trump\u2019s words to mean something.\n\nAs we go forward into the New Year and the new election cycle, one wonders what they are thinking now.\n\nWhile writing this final article of 2019, this final article of a decade that has changed my life, I enjoyed a rare moment of levity while looking randomly back on another. Remember Kenneth Bone? Yeah, you do. Think red sweaters and town hall debates, second of three of those disturbing 2016 general election season\u2019s clashes of ideas.\n\nKen Bone \u2014 he\u2019s no conformist. He\u2019s the person a divided America needs right now. The man who brought some levity to the ludicrous, some vim to counter the vitriol. The only thing that was making America great again. As Ramzy Nasrallah put it, \u201cWas so sad and ashamed throughout the entire spectacle but then KEN BONE rose like a Phoenix from America\u2019s ashes and there\u2019s laughter again.\u201d\n\nHe was that guy who sounded normal in a place where that word has lost all meaning if indeed it ever had one, and so at that moment, he proudly claimed the Warholian fifteen minutes of proverbial fame because of it.\n\nThat night the name of Kenneth Bone was on the tongue of every commentator and coming out of every pen, just as much as the names of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. It was dancing on the keyboards a digital fandango. Nobody could stop, it seemed; it was the Kenneth Bone Experience\u2019s nature to be inherently addictive.\n\nA rapper whose name I no longer remember wrote a verse about it that I find myself thinking about from time to time these days, in \u201c The Ballad Of Ken Bone \u201c, destined for classic status long before the hour of its birth.\n\nWhere have you gone, Kenneth Bone? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.\n\nDarkest of timelines, man. You better believe it.\n\nGoing forward into the New Year, hopefully the last of the miserable era to bear Trump\u2019s wicked name, it\u2019s good for us to touch base with our values. Sometimes it feels like all this time spent underground in these trenches and tunnels has changed me forever, not to mention the carnival funhouse outside.\n\nI\u2019m not the only one, either. Anderson Cooper on CNN tonight shared that many people have come forward to share stories about what the years between now and Ken Bone have done to them, and the one universal in these personal anecdotes was this: I\u2019m not the same person I was before.\n\nNone of us are, and how could we be? We don\u2019t live in the same country.\n\nThis is why we\u2019re getting rid of Donald Trump.\n\nThe only person active in American politics today who could have handled this in the masterly fashion we have seen is Nancy Pelosi. Stand with our Speaker, therefore, we say again. The strength she has brought to the meeting, as she told the illegitimate and babyish 45th president, cannot be characterized.\n\nOh yeah. Jonathan Mann was the name of that rapper; he actually wasn\u2019t a rapper, as rappers do not use guitars, but we\u2019ll forgive him that small misdemeanor. Props, man. Wherever you may be in this strange vast world of ours, we at Millennial Democrats wish you well, and all of our fellow men.\n\nHappy New Year, America.
