That fight has had horrifying consequences for the Iranian people, led Tehran to restart its nuclear program, and now left parts of the American embassy compound in Baghdad in flames. In the days and weeks to come, Trump\u2019s policy will likely lead either to war or to additional American humiliation, or both.\n\nThe fight began in May 2018, when the Trump administration left the Iran nuclear deal, and intensified last spring, when the United States designated Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization and moved to shut off Iran\u2019s ability to export oil. Numerous observers warned that Iran would meet America\u2019s escalation with escalation of its own. The Revolutionary Guard Corps designation, The New York Times reported last April, \u201cwas opposed by some top Trump administration national security officials who said it could incite retaliation by Tehran against American troops and intelligence officers.\u201d The following month, the Times added that \u201cin private meetings, military officials have warned the White House that its maximum-pressure campaign against Iran is motivating \u2026 threats to United States troops and American interests in the Middle East.\u201d In The Atlantic that same month, Mike Giglio noted, \u201cThe militia groups that act as Iranian proxies in Iraq \u2026 would be an effective tool for further [Iranian] escalation\u201d against the U.S.\n\nThese predictions have proved correct. In May, the United States accused Iran of attacking oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. Then, in June, Iran shot down an American drone.\n\nIran\u2019s escalation left the Trump administration in a quandary. The president likes grand diplomatic gestures. But his administration\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran deal\u2014combined with its absurdly maximalist demand that, as a condition for any future nuclear agreement, Iran entirely capitulate to Saudi Arabia in the two countries\u2019 contest for regional influence\u2014has made a diplomatic solution to the crisis virtually impossible. In June, Trump\u2019s then\u2013national security adviser, John Bolton, argued for meeting Iran\u2019s provocations with force. But Trump, convinced that his supporters want no more Middle Eastern wars, called off an attack aimed at punishing Iran for the drone strike. The attack on the drone didn\u2019t kill any Americans, Trump explained. If it had, that would have made \u201ca big, big difference.\u201d\n\nIn backing down, he thus established a red line. And last week, Iran\u2019s proxies crossed it. An Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, Kataib Hezbollah, fired on an Iraqi military base, wounding four American servicemen and killing an American contractor. This time, the Trump administration did respond with force: On Sunday, it launched air strikes against the militia\u2019s forces in Iraq and Syria, killing 24 people and wounding 50.\n\nBut if Trump\u2019s nonresponse made America look weak in June, his military response on Sunday set off a chain of events that has made America look even weaker. On Tuesday, following funeral services for the dead militiamen, thousands of supporters of Kataib Hezbollah and other pro-Iranian militias stormed the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, shouting \u201cDeath to America.\u201d Outraged by the U.S. attacks, many of Iraq\u2019s top clerics and politicians are now demanding the withdrawal of all American troops. On Tuesday, Abbas Kadhim, the director of the Iraq initiative at the Atlantic Council, tweeted, \u201cI expect the days of the large American diplomatic & business presence in Iraq to be numbered.\u201d Liz Sly, The Washington Post\u2019s bureau chief in Beirut, predicted an end game reminiscent of Saigon in 1975. \u201cAfter today,\u201d she tweeted, \u201chow do the Americans trapped inside the embassy leave except by helicopter?\u201d\n\nTrump, as is his wont, has responded with bluster: \u201cIran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities,\u201d he tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cThey will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat.\u201d The Pentagon announced plans to send in reinforcements. But with each escalation, Trump\u2019s predicament worsens. His confidants insist that he can\u2019t afford a war\u2014which would likely boost oil prices and damage the economy\u2014especially in an election year. Yet he also can\u2019t pursue real diplomacy, at least not without provoking a confrontation with the GOP\u2019s hawkish foreign-policy elite. He\u2019s caught between his desire to avoid being like George W. Bush and his desire to avoid being like Barack Obama.\n\nSo, absent a revolution that replaces the Islamic Republic with a more pliant regime, he\u2019s at Iran\u2019s mercy. Given the crushing sanctions America continues to impose, Iran has every incentive to make America bleed. Its proxy armies offer it numerous opportunities to do so. And every time it does, it offers Trump the unenviable choice of launching a potentially catastrophic third Middle Eastern war or being exposed as a paper tiger.\n\nWhen it comes to Iran, Trump has shifted Republican foreign policy away from war without shifting it toward diplomacy\u2014the only stable alternative to war. So he\u2019s caught in a kind of purgatory. The American embassy compound in Baghdad, now covered in pro-Iranian graffiti and strewn with broken glass, is the latest symbol of that purgatory. It probably won\u2019t be the last.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Donald Trump", "Iranian people", "Trump administration", "Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps", "left parts of the American embassy compound", "Trump\u2019s policy", "United States", "following month", "New York Times", "Middle Eastern wars", "Iranian proxies", "nuclear program", "last spring", "Atlantic Council", "nuclear deal", "military officials", "top Trump administration", "militia groups", "United States troops", "Abbas Kadhim", "additional American humiliation", "American troops", "America\u2019s escalation", "Middle East", "funeral services", "director of the Iraq initiative", "private meetings", "Revolutionary Guard Corps designation", "White House", "Iran\u2019s ability", "national security officials", "national security adviser", "American interests", "pro-Iranian militias", "George W.
