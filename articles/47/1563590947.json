Strict social distancing measures to combat the virus outbreak are hard to adopt in centers where people live together in tight spaces.\n\nGermany has imposed strict rules on social distancing, and some federal states have ordered lockdowns in a bid to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Asylum centers too are affected, but measures differ between states.\n\n\n\nHere are examples of what has come into effect, as reported by dpa*:\n\nTesting upon arrival\n\nAll newly arriving asylum seekers are tested for the coronavirus in centers in the states of Bavaria, Bremen, Saxony, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nIn Bremen, tested persons are put in quarantine until results are in.\n\nIn Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Saxony and Brandenburg, tested persons are put in separate accommodation and in Schleswig-Holstein only those showing symptoms are isolated.\n\nIn North-Rhine Westphalia asylum seekers are screened for symptoms and asked about their travel routes. There are five first reception centers in the state which have rotating reception cycles: only one center at a time admits new asylum seekers for several days followed by a suspension on reception and transfers for two weeks.\n\nIn Lower Saxony, new arrivals are examined. Tests are only done if people show symptoms or if it is seen as necessary due to the asylum seeker's travel route.\n\nThuringia tests if people show first symptoms.\n\nCoronavirus cases in asylum centers\n\nAt the time of reporting on March 23, the German news agency dpa collected the following data on infections:\n\nBerlin has registered 4 positive cases of coronavirus among asylum seekers in asylum centers in the state. One staff member in a center also tested positive.\n\nIn Bavaria, 10 out of 1,900 asylum seekers tested were infected.\n\nIn Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, there are reportedly 2 registered cases each\n\nBaden-W\u00fcrttemberg, there are 8 cases.\n\nHesse, Thuringia: 1 each\n\nBremen, North-Rhine Westphalia and Lower-Saxony: none\n\nIsolation measures\n\nAsylum seekers who are tested positive, contact persons as well as suspected cases are put in isolation, meaning they are accommodated seperately. That's according to the interior ministries of all the states that responded to dpa's information request.\n\nRestriction measures Asylum centers have introduced restrictive measures in line with the measures that are implemented in almost all parts of public and private life in Germany. These include: Stricter hygiene rules like more frequent cleaning of the facilities\n\nNorth-Rhine Westphalia centers report they have put up disinfectant stations\n\nBremen centers report they have switched to handing out foil-wrapped food only\n\nIn many centers, school classes, nursery care and integration courses have been suspended\n\nMany centers have also closed common areas to avoid gatherings of people\n\nEveryone is required to keep a distance of at least 1.5 meters between themselves and other people. To make this possible, some centers report they have put on the floor indicators for distance.\n\nSome canteens have introduced lunch in \"shifts\" or take-away lunches to avoid large group gatherings Asylum centers have introduced restrictive measures in line with the measures that are implemented in almost all parts of public and private life in Germany. These include:\n\nInformation in foreign languages\n\nAsylum centers across the country are putting up health advice and information about preventive measures against the coronavirus. These can be in the form of posters or flyers, for example.\n\nThe centers are also attempting to make the information available in other languages beside German or English.\n\nThe Berlin office for refugees (Landesamt f\u00fcr Fl\u00fcchtlingsangelegenheiten, LAF) published information about the coronavirus and quarantine in asylum centers in several languages. It's available online as audio files: Here are the links: ENGLISH, FRENCH, ARABIC, FARSI, VIETNAMESE, RUSSIAN, TURKISH\n\nAccording to LAF, many asylum seekers in the centers have formed WhatsApp or Facebook groups where they keep each other informed, too.\n\nFor general information on coronavirus: The website of the Federal Commissioner for Migration, Refugees and Integration offers information about Covid-19 in 11 foreign languages including English.\n\n\n\nThe Robert-Koch Institute publishes daily situation reports on Covid-19 in English as well as German. They include information about the epidemiological situation in Germany, risk areas and measures taken by the government such as border restrictions.\n\n*Note: Not all 16 states responded to the information enquiries sent out by dpa reporters. This article does not represent a complete list of measures taken in all German states.\n\nAid and counseling suspended\n\nIn addition to measures taken inside asylum centers like trying to keep a 1.5 meter distance between people, the coronavirus measures are also taking its toll on volunteer and migrant aid services. Many organizations have had to reduce their staff numbers. Integration and language courses are put on hold. Personal counseling or in person contact is no longer possible, and in some asylum centers, non-residents are not allowed to enter the building. This means that many services are heavily reduced, such as legal counseling for asylum seekers or psychological support where online support is not possible.\n\nIn an article by Sueddeutsche Zeitung describing the situation at the anchor center for asylum seekers in Manching, Bavaria, the asylum commissioner of the archdiocese Munich, Rainer Boeck, is quoted as saying: \"Volunteer activities have come to a near standstill.\" Aid workers and volunteers are not allowed in the anchor center Manching any longer. Boeck is worried that asylum seekers will be left to fend for themselves, as much of the reception care depended on the help of volunteers.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Asylum seekers", "Asylum center", "coronavirus"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 24 13:36:50 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Several migrants living in asylum shelters in Germany have tested positive for coronavirus.
