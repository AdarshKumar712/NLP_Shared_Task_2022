Government should bother more on infrastructure and incentives for businesses to thrive.\n\n\"I trust that there will be improvement this year with policies and programmes already on ground for which most of them are already at implementation stage.\"\n\nHe also called on the political class to know when to close ranks, especially when an issue is such that will affect the welfare of the people.\n\nHe said: \"I also want to call on the political class to know when politicking takes the back seat. Whenever the welfare and security of the people are involved, we must be careful on the way we carry on. I say so because it does not show leadership when we put our selfish desires and interest above that of the general well being of the people.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The immediate past Deputy Governor of Imo State, Prince Eze Madumere has felicitated with the good people of Imo State and Nigerians at large, wishing them a mo", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Madumere wishes Imolites, Nigerians a prosperous 2020", "description": "The immediate past Deputy Governor of Imo State, Prince Eze Madumere has felicitated with the good people of Imo State and Nigerians at large, wishing them a mo", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheNigerianVoic", "title": "Madumere wishes Imolites, Nigerians a prosperous 2020", "description": "The immediate past Deputy Governor of Imo State, Prince Eze Madumere has felicitated with the good people of Imo State and Nigerians at large, wishing them a mo", "creator": "@TheNigerianVoic", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.thenigerianvoice.com/images/content/112020102825_eze_madumere.jpeg"}, "domain": "www.thenigerianvoice.com"}, "og": {"site_name": "Nigerian Voice", "title": "Madumere wishes Imolites, Nigerians a prosperous 2020", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thenigerianvoice.com/news/284030/madumere-wishes-imolites-nigerians-a-prosperous-2020.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.thenigerianvoice.com/images/content/112020102825_eze_madumere.jpeg", "alt": "Madumere wishes Imolites, Nigerians a prosperous 2020"}, "description": "The immediate past Deputy Governor of Imo State, Prince Eze Madumere has felicitated with the good people of Imo State and Nigerians at large, wishing them a mo"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1403992796296002}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nigerianvoice"}, "expires": "never", "distribution": "global", "rating": "general", "robots": "index,follow", "google-site-verification": "xgmQqsNVj5IHhFnjkC54yIuqCZT-Z2qocoJzSdiRb1g", "msvalidate.01": "829F79F50089C06F7BA89C25B804CC7D"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thenigerianvoice.com/news/284030/madumere-wishes-imolites-nigerians-a-prosperous-2020.html"}
