beach.\n\nThe 2020 edition of the carnival returns for its second weekend Saturday Feb. 8 and Sunday Feb. 9, featuring an ATV Poker Run, which annually brings hundreds of three- and four-wheeled all-terrain vehicles and their riders into the village.\n\nBut with the ice of Lake George not yet thick enough to support automobiles, the sports car ice racing events scheduled for the carnival have been postponed until later this month, event officials said this week.\n\nAll the carnival\u2019s other traditional attractions are to occur as planned.\n\nThe variety of children\u2019s activities is vast this year, featuring pony rides, face painting, and indoor craft sessions \u2014 all held both Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAll ages will enjoy Saturday\u2019s barbecue cook-off, evening fireworks, and ice diving demonstrations.\n\nAlso on Feb. 8 are tie-dyeing of T-shirts in snow, and making s\u2019mores or sipping hot chocolate beside a bonfire on Shepard Park Beach.\n\nSunday features youth hockey competitions on ice, make-your-own sundaes, an open mic session, a keg toss contest on the beach, and a snowman-building contest.\n\nHeld both Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m. are the \u201cDogs Got Talent\u201d shows, in which aanyone can enter their pet or watch the canine antics, as well as the traditional bonfire-on-the-beach likely be to burning from mid-afternoon into the evening.\n\nBoth days also host woodcarving demonstrations, cornhole games, children\u2019s activities, as well as the traditional carnival Polar Plunge, in which people of all ages dash into the frigid water, while others watch and wince.\n\nSleigh and carriage rides, as well as helicopter excursions are also to be offered through the weekend.\n\nTimes of these events and other details are posted online at: LakeGeorgeWinterCarnival.com.\n\n\u201cWe provide a wide variety of activities for people of all ages, offering them the opportunity to get outdoors and really enjoy winter,\u201d carnival official Lou Tokos said. \u25a0", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Thom Randall", "shepard park beach", "nys", "bonfires", "Shepard Park", "Dogs Got Talent", "New York", "canine talent
