Had he done so he said he would have passed this onto the mayor to address.\"\n\nThere were no privacy issues because there was good reason to do the check, and the councillors' Facebook pages were public, Chemis said.\n\nThe monitoring was revealed after Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act requests.\n\nAdministrative oversights complicated the handling of those requests, Chemis found, but this \"did not involve any wilful or malicious behaviour\".\n\nPhoto: RNZ / Anusha Bradley\n\nEmails released alongside the review show the council objected to the draft review in November.\n\n\"The report fails to address the shortcomings and failures of persons involved,\" the new mayor Kirsten Wise, who was one of four councillors monitored, told Chemis after the council had looked at his draft findings.\n\n\"The report downplays the active eroding of democracy through the planned, coordinated activities, directed by the CEO on elected members.\"\n\nChemis wrote back that he had fulfilled the terms of reference given to him.\n\nA day later the mayor replied that she appreciated the terms \"limited your ability to address many of the concerns highlighted by councillors\" and she was happy for him to proceed and finalise his report.\n\nWise today said it was time to put the matter behind them.\n\n\"We don't want to spend another dollar of ratepayer money reviewing on what has happened in the past. We now have a new council team,\" she said.\n\nThe mandate from the vote in local body elections in October was for councillors and the whole council to become more transparent and accountable, and that was happening, despite the review's terms of reference being \"potentially too narrow\".\n\n\"Look, I'm confident it won't happen again.\n\n\"We've absolutely had the conversation about what is appropriate going forward. It's been a conversation just saying if staff are going to be looking at councillors' social media pages, why are they doing that?\"\n\nAlso, councillors would now always be told in advance if the council had received a LGOIMA request that involved them.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Radio New Zealand", "RNZ", "Public Radio", "News", "Current Affairs", "Audio", "Podcasts"], "tags": ["politics", "law"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 24 12:00:56 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "An investigation has found there was good reason for Napier City Council staff to be asked to monitor councillors' social media posts.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/x/favicons/apple-icon-57x57-eefff803139f2489c8070daecf6456be0034dd1dfc326746b70d9eb8e8232199.png", "meta_data": {"Generator": "ELF", "description": "An investigation has found there was good reason for Napier City Council staff to be asked to monitor councillors' social media posts.", "keywords": "Radio New Zealand, RNZ, Public Radio, News, Current Affairs, Audio, Podcasts", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "EAL": "news:406134", "og": {"site_name": "RNZ", "url": "https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/406134/monitoring-napier-councillors-facebook-accounts-was-lawful-report", "type": "article", "title": "Monitoring Napier councillors' Facebook accounts was 'lawful' - report", "description": "An investigation has found there was good reason for Napier City Council staff to be asked to monitor councillors' social media posts.", "image": "https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/86370/eight_col_monitoring.JPG?1566763630"}, "fb": {"admins": 1076742843, "pages": 116876028325133}, "article": {"published_time": "2019-12-24T12:00:56+13:00", "modified_time": "2019-12-24T12:00:56+13:00", "section": "New Zealand"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@rnz_news", "title": "Monitoring Napier councillors' Facebook accounts was 'lawful' - report", "description": "An investigation has found there was good reason for Napier City Council staff to be asked to monitor councillors' social media posts.", "image": "https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/86370/eight_col_monitoring.JPG?1566763630"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/x/favicons/ms-icon-144x144-cd317fd008139bc4fce0a2a9dd8c1ef48d95cf17810bfcb9b1336042f8203b2a.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/406134/monitoring-napier-councillors-facebook-accounts-was-lawful-report"}
