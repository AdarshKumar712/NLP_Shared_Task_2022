in the province so far.\n\nHealth Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said this is a special decade for the country as it prepares to implement the highly-debated National Health Insurance.\n\nMkhize said all the newborns have been issued with birth certificates and this will be the standard practice once the NHI is fully implemented.\n\n#2020NewYear Health Minister Zweli Mkhize is at the newly refurbished

We need this to be picked up on all preventable diseases.\"\n\nMkhize has called on society to transform so that the newborns are raised in a peaceful South Africa.\n\n\"Non-natural causes of death are also a big issue. When you talk about the issue of violence against women and children, car accidents, as well as homicides - all of these are preventable. They are all about societal transformation.\"\n\n22 NEW YEAR'S BABIES BORN IN THE WESTERN CAPE\n\nTen boys and 12 girls have been born so far on the first day of the new decade in the Western Cape, making a total of 22.\n\nHealth MEC, Nomafrench Mbombo, visited the Khayelitsha District Hospital where one birth has been recorded for New Year's Day so far.\n\nWeighing 3.3 kilograms, a baby boy was the first birth registered in the province at Mowbray's Maternity Hospital.\n\nThe second baby boy was born at 00:13 at Paarl Hospital weighing 3.65 kilograms.
