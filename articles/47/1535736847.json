Volkswagen Group\u2019s first electric car, the e-up!1, was launched in autumn 2013. And even then, the electric drive, or e-drive for short, developed in northern Hesse, was the heart of the car. Series production has been underway in Kassel since 2014. In the future, the daily production of the ID. Family will be producing 2,000 e-drives per day.\n\nCompared to a conventional combustion engine, the electric drive brings about some changes: The maximum torque is immediately available in electric motors and remains constant over a wide speed range. The use of a so-called 1-speed transmission is therefore sufficient for the entire speed range. For reversing, the direction of rotation of the electric drive is simply reversed with the help of the power electronics. In the ID.32, the complete APP310 drive unit with the gearbox, the essential parts of which are manufactured by Volkswagen Group Components, is extremely compact. With just a few gears, it transmits the power of the electric drive to the wheels \u2013 one gear is sufficient for all driving situations. As a result, the 1-speed transmission saves space and weight compared to a conventional representative.\n\nThe ID.3 transmission is a 1-speed transmission with two speeds. In the ID.3, high speeds are required to reach the maximum power of 150 kW. In order to deliver powerful torque, the 1-speed gearbox uses about ten times the transmission ratio. In order to save space, the transmission ratio was designed with two smaller two-stage gears instead of one large gear. For the ID.3, which is optimized for range, the use of only one gear is perfectly adequate for all driving situations.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "February 29, 2020 is a leap year day.
