The first mover effect is important and being able to take the Konsolidator platform to other countries is vital for Konsolidator in order to be the preferred consolidation software and de facto standard, worldwide. The next phase of the Konsolidator journey requires an extra 10 employees, primarily within sales and marketing to accelerate the continued geographical expansion of Konsolidator. The focus of the internationalization will be the rest of Europe more specifically the Nordics and other Western European countries.\n\nClaus Finderup Grove, Chief Executive Officer, said: \u201cSince the IPO in May 2019, we have continued to experience strong demand for our cloud-based consolidation software. The proceeds raised in the IPO supported us in accelerating the roll-out of Konsolidator to Germany, the UK and Sweden, and we experienced in Q1, 2020 more contract wins abroad than in Denmark. To continue the rapid roll-out further investments and new hires are required, and I am pleased to see that we have been able to leverage our platform as a listed company to raise additional equity less than 12 months after the IPO to a strong institutional investor. The transaction marks another milestone in Konsolidator\u2019s history and I am delighted to invite another reputable investor to join us for the next phase of our growth journey\u201d.\n\nThe Offer Shares were subscribed for and sold to one investor. The investor purchased 750,000 Offer Shares at an offer price of DKK 39.5 per share, as determined by the Board of Directors.\n\nCapital increase\n\nAfter settlement of the capital increase, the share capital of the Company will consist of 15,454,546 shares with a nominal value of DKK 0.04 each.\n\nThe nominal value of the Offer Shares represents approximately 4.9 % of the Company\u2019s registered share capital of DKK 618,181.84 after the capital increase.\n\nExpected timetable\n\nApril 30, 2020: Settlement and payment for the Offer Shares\n\nApril 30, 2020: Registration of the capital increase with the Danish Business Authority\n\nMay 5, 2020: Offer Shares to be admitted to trading and official listing on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market\n\nFinancial adviser\n\nDanske Bank A/S acted as Sole Global Coordinator in connection with the Offering.\n\nAbout Konsolidator\n\nKonsolidator is a cloud-based and standardized SaaS consolidation and reporting tool that automates consolidation and monthly reporting and delivers accurate and timely management information based on corporate key ratios.
