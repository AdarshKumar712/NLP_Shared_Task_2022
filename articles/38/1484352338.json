It\u2019s a year when more united Nigeria is nonnegotiable to a financially independent country where every hand must be on deck to achieve a greater feat across all sectors.\u201d\n\nHe urged the youth to be more pragmatic and purpose-driven as they explore the available opportunities for the year.\n\n\u201cThere is need for the youth to be more productive particularly on social media as they explore the available opportunities for the year. We must ensure that every time counts if we really dare to see a better Nigeria in 2020.\n\n\u201cTo achieve this, the youth must be more united like never before as they harness the available resources around to build a Nigeria of our dream.\u201d\n\nThe student activist advised the government to leverage the experiences of the previous year in making 2020 more prosperous for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe government of the day must checkmate its strengths and weaknesses in 2019 while leveraging these experiences to provide better facilities that will in turn, benefit many Nigerians in the long run. By this, I mean the government should not only rely on its manifestoes, but rather be more realistic in providing means for the populace that will make the year more prosperous for them,\u201d he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://kogireports.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/animated_favicon1.gif", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "http://kogireports.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Israel-Arogbonlo-3-300x196.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://kogireports.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cropped-animated_favicon1-270x270.gif"}, "canonical_link": "http://kogireports.com/2020-arogbonlo-calls-for-more-united-nigeria/"}
