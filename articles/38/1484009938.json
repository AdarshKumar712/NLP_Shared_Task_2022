We, therefore, appeal to parents and guardians to desist from discouraging their wards who want to venture into these fields of study. You will never know what the future holds,\u201d she said.\n\nMr Kenneth Kponor, the Volta Regional Director of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), asked the graduates to make the most of the training and strive to become entrepreneurs and open up employment avenues for others.\n\nHe also urged them to encourage their peers to consider vocational skills as a lifeline they could easily access.\n\nThe institute was established as the Venadash Training Center, providing skills training in bead making and event decoration.\n\nIt was in 2012, transformed into an institute, and adopted the syllabus of the University of Florida, USA, and won accreditation from the National Vocational Training Board in 2015.\n\nIt operates faculties of Applied Arts, and Culinary Arts, and runs two programme sessions each academic year.\n\nGNA", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["{keywords}"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "{description}", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://ghananewsagency.org/favicon.gif", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive", "description": "{description}", "keywords": "{keywords}", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-translate-customization": "ed4e15358d21bc05-cdb86c6b2a6a0bd0-gdff7727f8d39ef2a-13", "fb": {"pages": 547130695310674, "admins": 539319879}, "og": {"type": "article", "author": "Ghana News Agency", "title": "Venadash Institute of Decorative Arts graduates 22 women", "url": "https://ghananewsagency.org/social/venadash-institute-of-decorative-arts-graduates-22-women-162076", "image": "https://ghananewsagency.org/assets/images/social-women-arts.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@FreshNews_Ghana", "description": "news, story, article", "creator": "@GHANANEWSAGENCY"}}, "canonical_link": "https://ghananewsagency.org/social/venadash-institute-of-decorative-arts-graduates-22-women-162076"}
