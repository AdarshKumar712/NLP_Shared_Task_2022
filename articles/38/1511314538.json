Yes, defense typically wins the championship.\n\nNo, the 49ers defense, powered by the NFL\u2019s best D-line and bolstered on the back end by savvy cornerback Richard Sherman, won\u2019t totally extinguish a Kansas City Chiefs offense triggered by one of the game\u2019s most electric players. Somehow, they must counter the notion that speed kills. The need for heat on Mahomes is obvious. But even with that, the magic of KC\u2019s QB is always an X-factor.\n\nIn other words, it won\u2019t be pretty or textbook-preserved. Yet when it\u2019s over, the 49ers could be the Super Bowl champions \u2013 like Philly, in LII -- who allow more than 30 points and still wins. As long as that defense can make a stop when it needs it the most.\n\nThe 49ers will win because they, too, are capable of lighting up the scoreboard.\n\nTHE OTHER SIDE:One big reason why the Chiefs will be the champs\n\nMORE PREDICTIONS:Full staff picks for Super Bowl, MVP and more\n\nPROP BETS:The best, craziest and most offbeat Super Bowl wagers\n\nBalance is the ticket for Kyle Shanahan\u2019s team. The 49ers defense is complemented by a sophisticated offense that can control the tempo with a potent, zone-blocking running game \u2013 yet is also versatile enough to morph into a unit that can roll with Jimmy Garoppolo\u2019s arm.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that the same 49ers who ran all over the Packers in the NFC title game (285 yards on 42 rushes) also won a shootout at New Orleans in December when Garoppolo threw for 349 yards and 4 TDs. It\u2019s on tape. They can do it.\n\nIt might take the best game of Garoppolo\u2019s life \u2013 I\u2019m talking no-mistake efficient, not necessarily record-breaking yardage \u2013 to out-point Mahomes. But it\u2019s a team game. Shanahan would be perfectly fine if they can somehow repeat the type of punishing rushing game the 49ers demonstrated in the two NFC playoff victories with 471 yards on 89 runs in the two games. Although Kansas City\u2019s defense has improved as the season has progressed, and held NFL rushing king Derrick Henry to 69 yards in the AFC title game, the challenge will be greater at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday because it is on the wrong side of the strength vs. weakness variable. Regardless, the 49ers can strike in more ways than one.\n\nIS THAT GRONK?:No, but this 49ers star could easily take over Super Bowl\n\nMORE SUPER BOWL:Everything you need for the big game\n\nPresumably, Shanahan learned something about situational play-calling during his Super Bowl appearance with the Falcons in LI, when New England\u2019s ability to come back from a 28-3 deficit was enabled by risking play-calling that backfired, among other reasons. This time, he should know when common-sense play-calling will work, even if it\u2019s not sexy.\n\nNo team in the NFL this season that went through a gauntlet as difficult as the 49ers faced. That\u2019s a factor, too. They are battle tested.\n\nHere\u2019s to thinking the 49ers will pass the final exam to claim the franchise\u2019s sixth Super Bowl crown. And the wait for Mahomes and Reid to bring Kansas City its first NFL championship in more than 50 years will carry over to next season. Maybe the Chiefs are next year\u2019s champs.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
