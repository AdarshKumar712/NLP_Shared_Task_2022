He hopes at least some of that is with the Detroit Lions.\n\nDaniels said earlier this week that he plans to return for a ninth NFL season in 2020 and \"absolutely\" wants it to be in Detroit.\n\n\"Just get back to the lab,\" Daniels said. \"This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve missed time and didn\u2019t go to the playoffs, so get back to work. Things\u2019ll turn around and that\u2019ll be about it.\"\n\nCut by the Green Bay Packers after a foot injury cost him the final six games of the 2018 season, Daniels signed a one-year deal with the Lions in July that paid him about $8 million.\n\nLions defensive lineman Mike Daniels talks with reporters after practice during training camp on Sunday, July 28, 2019, in Allen Park. (Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier, Detroit Free Press)\n\nHe missed five games early this season with a sprained foot, returned to play six straight games in November and December, then finished the year on injured reserve after hurting his arm in a Week 15 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nDaniels, who had 10 tackles in nine games this season, said he's healthy enough now that he'd be able to play in a game if the Lions had one this weekend.\n\nMore: What Aaron Rodgers' 2019 decline tells us about Matthew Stafford's future\n\n\"I\u2019m good,\" he said. \"I think it was one of those precautionary things like, 'Oh, the season\u2019s over.'\"\n\nThe Lions spent big on their defensive line in 2019, signing Daniels and Trey Flowers to large free-agent deals and extending the contract of Damon Harrison, and they'll likely have to rebuild the unit again this offseason.\n\nHarrison said he's considering retirement after an injury-filled season, A'Shawn Robinson is a free agent who seems destined to explore his options elsewhere, Da'Shawn Hand finished his second straight season on injured reserve, and Daniels' future in Detroit is unclear.\n\nDaniels played well in limited snaps this season \u2013 he was the Lions' fifth-highest rated defensive player, according to Pro Football Focus \u2013 but his recent injury history is a concern and the Lions have enough cap space to pursue a top-tier free agent at the position should they choose.\n\nArizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray tries to elude Detroit Lions defensive lineman Mike Daniels during the first half Sunday, Sept. 8, 2019, in Glendale, Ariz. (Photo: Darryl Webb, AP)\n\nDaniels said he'll let his agent handle the contractual stuff, but he \"definitely, definitely want(s) to be back here.\"\n\n\"I feel good,\" Daniels said. \"So I\u2019m excited to get things rolling, see what happens. Definitely want to make sure I get back here.\"\n\nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @davebirkett.
