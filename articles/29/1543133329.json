Jesse Jackson Sr. on Sunday endorsed 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders and urged black voters to reject the \u201cmoderate path\u201d in favor of a progressive agenda that aims to actually meet the needs and demands of their communities.\n\nThe endorsement from Jackson, who sought the Democratic nomination in 1984 and 1988, came just a day after the U.S. senator from Vermont held a rally in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park attended by about 15,000 people. Jackson spoke Sunday at a Sanders campaign event in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nRegistered Democrats in Michigan, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, and Washington are slated to weigh in on the party\u2019s presidential primary race on March 10, followed by voters in Illinois, Arizona, Florida, and Ohio on March 17.\n\nThe only way we will defeat Trump in November is by bringing in people who have given up on the the political process. We have the movement and agenda to do that. Live now from Grand Rapids with Rev. Jesse Jackson: https://t.co/WpDcJbCty8 \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) March 8, 2020\n\nSince Super Tuesday, political commentators have declared the contest a two-person race between Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden \u201cfor the future of the Democratic Party and the country.\u201d Jackson said in his endorsement of Sanders Sunday that \u201cwe have a right to ask and expect candidates who benefit from the African-American political firewall to deliver what we need under the potential leadership of Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the exception of Native Americans, African Americans are the people who are most behind socially and economically in the United States and our needs are not moderate,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cA people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path. The most progressive social and economic path gives us the best chance to catch up and Senator Bernie Sanders represents the most progressive path. That\u2019s why I choose to endorse him today.\u201d\n\nToday is a special day for our campaign. Rev. Jesse Jackson is one of the most transformative figures in modern American history and a hero of mine. It is one of the honors of my life to have his support. pic.twitter.com/CAszZIuKDT \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) March 8, 2020\n\n\u201cThe Biden campaign has not reached out to me or asked for my support,\u201d Jackson noted. \u201cThe Sanders campaign has, and they responded to the issues I raised and the concerns I expressed.\u201d The civil rights leader shared a list of 13 comments and commitments from the Sanders campaign, which included addressing voter suppression; tax and trade reforms; advancing Medicare for All; providing high-quality, free public education; and promoting peace and ending endless wars.\n\nThe campaign also pledged that as president, Sanders will ensure that Black women are in his cabinet, at the highest levels of his administration, and on the U.S. Supreme Court; \u201cwork to create a market\u201d for black farmers,\u201d who have historically faced discrimination; invest in specific educational needs of black, brown and poor communities; commit extra funding to rural and minority health centers; and support \u201cmore trade and fair trade between African Americans, Africa, and the Caribbean nations.\u201d\n\nSanders announced Jackson\u2019s endorsement on ABC News Sunday morning after being asked about former primary rival Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) endorsing Biden:\n\nJUST IN: Sen. Bernie Sanders tells @GStephanopoulos that civil rights activist Jesse Jackson will endorse him later today. \u201cWe have the support of virtually every major grassroots organization.\u201d https://t.co/omRqv4pvVR pic.twitter.com/eCoe3yD4uq \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) March 8, 2020\n\nThe Intercept\u2018s Ryan Grim reported Sunday that the \u201cRainbow Coalition Comes Full Circle as Jesse Jackson Endorses Bernie Sanders,\u201d referring to the political organization that grew out of Jackson\u2019s 1984 presidential race.\n\nIn 1988, as Grim detailed, Jackson secured a significant victory in the Michigan primary and Sanders\u2014then the Independent mayor of Burlington, Vermont\u2014supported his insurgent candidacy:\n\nAfter the Michigan victory, Bernie Sanders went all in, calling a local press conference and announcing that he would be participating in the April Democratic caucus to back Jackson. \u201cI am the only non-Democrat, non-Republican, Independent progressive mayor in the United States of America. OK, it is awkward, I freely admit, it is awkward for me to walk into a Democratic Party caucus, believe me, it is awkward. I am not a Democrat. Period,\u201d he said. But he said the stakes were too high, and the opportunity too great, to stand aside on principle. Jackson, he argued, could remake the Democratic Party in an image of social justice. \u201cSo while in fact, he may end up losing some conservative white votes, some racist white votes, I think there is a real chance that he could do what [Walter] Mondale couldn\u2019t do in a million years. That is to bring millions and millions of poor people and working people into the political arena who in the past never participated.\u201d\n\nThe embrace of Jackson\u2019s rise in Burlington was quite different from the reaction of \u201cpandemonium\u201d in Washington, D.C. As Grim put it: \u201cJust as party leaders melted down publicly after Sanders\u2019 win in the Nevada caucuses, they did so after Jackson\u2019s triumph in Michigan.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he noted, \u201cBiden, then a senator from Delaware, had dropped out of the race following a plagiarism scandal and dismal polling numbers.\u201d\n\nGrim was far from alone in regarding Jackson\u2019s endorsement of Sanders as a \u201cfull circle moment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible Full Circle moment. 1988: Bernie Sanders Endorses Jesse Jackson For President 2020: Jesse Jackson Endorses Bernie Sanders For President. #SuperTuesday2 #MichiganPrimary pic.twitter.com/yRRarlWX4J \u2014 Andrew Jerell Jones (@sluggahjells) March 8, 2020", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jim Hightower", "Errin Haines Whack", "Adrian Sainz", "Kate Brumback", "The Associated Press", "Ilana Novick", "Chris Hedges", "Robert Scheer", "Anis Shivani", "Sonali Kolhatkar"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "He urges black voters to reject the \"moderate path\" in favor of a progressive agenda that aims to meet their communities' needs.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.truthdig.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cropped-truthdig_td_favicon512-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "He urges black voters to reject the \"moderate path\" in favor of a progressive agenda that aims to meet their communities' needs.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Civil Rights Leader Jesse Jackson Endorses Sanders", "description": "He urges black voters to reject the \"moderate path\" in favor of a progressive agenda that aims to meet their communities' needs.", "url": "https://www.truthdig.com/articles/civil-rights-leader-jesse-jackson-endorses-bernie-sanders-for-president/", "site_name": "Truthdig: Expert Reporting, Current News, Provocative Columnists", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.truthdig.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ESnFSqVXkAAJTCA.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.truthdig.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ESnFSqVXkAAJTCA.jpg", "width": 1536, "height": 1023}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Truthdig"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "He urges black voters to reject the \"moderate path\" in favor of a progressive agenda that aims to meet their communities' needs.", "title": "Civil Rights Leader Jesse Jackson Endorses Sanders", "site": "@Truthdig", "image": "https://www.truthdig.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ESnFSqVXkAAJTCA.jpg", "creator": "@Truthdig"}, "fb": {"pages": 64639136366}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.truthdig.com/articles/civil-rights-leader-jesse-jackson-endorses-bernie-sanders-for-president/?ia_markup=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Truthdig", "application-name": "Truthdig", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.truthdig.com/articles/civil-rights-leader-jesse-jackson-endorses-bernie-sanders-for-president/"}
