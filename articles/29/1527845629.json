extends 5.2 miles between Round Pond Trailhead and East Mill Flow Trailhead in the Sharp Bridge Campground.\n\nWest of Round Pond, the trail is known as the East Mill Flow Trail, and south of Round Pond the trail is known as the Round Pond Trail. The trail undulates gently over most of the distance, descending 295 feet in a 0.6-mile section before the last flat 0.6 mile along Schroon Brook to the campground. Measuring from the Round Pond Trailhead, the trail passes Trout Pond at 0.5-mile, Round Pond at 1.5 miles, and crosses East Mill Brook at 2.8 miles. This picturesque trail provides skiers and snowshoers a chance for solitude on a lesser traveled path.\n\nTrailhead parking:\n\nEast Mill Flow Trailhead is located in the Sharp Bridge Campground off US Route 9 and is plowed for winter use.\n\nRound Pond Trailhead Parking Area is located along Ensign Pond Road (County Route 4) off US Route 9. This parking area is also plowed for winter use.
