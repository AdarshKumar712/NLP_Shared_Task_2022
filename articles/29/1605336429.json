Central banks in Europe and Japan have moved their benchmark rates below zero in an attempt to stimulate lending, but research is mixed on whether the tactic works.\n\nIn Tuesday's webinar, Bullard also predicted that the U.S. economy will recover in the second half of this year from the shock caused by coronavirus-related shutdowns.\n\nBullard repeated his call for a \"risk-based\" reopening of the economy, saying the U.S. faces dire consequences if widespread business closures last for more than three or four months.\n\n\"After that you can't continue the shutdown policy because too many other things will start to happen,\" he said. \"You'll get business failures on a large scale and if you go too long you'll go into depression.\"\n\nA message from David Nicklaus Want to stay smart about what's happening in St. Louis?
