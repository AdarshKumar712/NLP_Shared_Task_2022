Andy Cohen joked about using heroin and there were some sexual innuendos. Later in the evening, Lemon showed his host, Brooke Baldwin, his penned tattoo. Baldwin appeared drunk as well.\n\nTwo narcissists, on a fake news show, drunk as lords, celebrating and talking trash. We didn\u2019t want you to miss it.\n\nIf you enjoy watching drunk anchors, @CNN is where you want to tune to. Andy Cohen just joked about using heroin. Brook Baldwin told Don Lemon her balls were bigger than his & he said, \u201cprobably.\u201d https://t.co/dEMqmcMpvo \u2014 Kathleen McKinley (@KatMcKinley) January 1, 2018\n\nwhat is going on lmao\u2026 drunk Don Lemon is saying something about white supremacy #CNNNYE pic.twitter.com/b4bn4gYGw8 \u2014 Josh S\u00e1nchez (@joshnsanchez) January 1, 2020\n\nmood don lemon on nye pic.twitter.com/PML5tf0v3K \u2014 KENNY MANSON (@phillycustoms) January 1, 2020\n\nDon Lemon is drunk and I\u2019m here for it. pic.twitter.com/otM3ENmVUd \u2014 (@CarlaVi32991520) January 1, 2020\n\nThis was last year.\n\nLast year drunk Don Lemon still hilarious pic.twitter.com/rK2abdJaqZ \u2014 The Reason (@TheReason540) January 1, 2020\n\nCNN reporter Leyla Santiago talks about how wearing \u201cred underwear\u201d is supposedly good for \u201cthe love\u201d and then proceeds to ask people what color underwear they are wearing. She does this right next to a little girl who was standing behind her and watching her the entire time. pic.twitter.com/dmQc161kEw \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) January 1, 2019\n\nNever letting a politicized moment go to waste, Trump-hating Anderson said last year that the Cohen feud reminded him of the arguments between Sarah Sanders and idiot showboater Jim Acosta.\n\nHe got a drunken piercing in 2018.\n\nCan\u2019t wait for @DonLemon\u2018s drunk emotional breakdown on #CNNNYE this year. 2016 was such a bad year for him that CNN even cut HIS OWN microphone last year. 2017 has been far worse for him & CNN.
