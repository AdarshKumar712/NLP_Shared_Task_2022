The pipeline terminal is near the Turkish village of Kiyikoy, some 20km from the Bulgarian border.\n\nRussia is also doubling the capacity of Nord Stream across the Baltic Sea to Germany as part of plans to bypass Ukraine, which is currently the main route of transit to Europe.\n\nRelations between Moscow and Kiev have deteriorated sharply since Russia incorporated Crimea in March 2014 and pro-Kremlin separatists seized a swath of eastern Ukraine. Ukraine halted its own direct imports of Russian gas in November 2015.\n\nLast month, the US Senate approved a defense bill imposing sanctions related to both TurkStream and Nord Stream 2, as part of measures designed \u201cto deter Russian aggression.\u201d\n\nRussian gas producer Gazprom will ship about 3 billion cubic meters of gas per year to Bulgaria via TurkStream, replacing a route that formerly passed through Ukraine and Romania.\n\nGazprom shipped about 3 billion cubic meters to Greece and about 500,000 million cubic meters to North Macedonia via that route last year.\n\nRussia is building TurkStream in two pipelines, each with an annual capacity of 15.75 billion cubic meters.\n\nThe first pipeline will supply Turkey and the second will extend from Bulgaria to Serbia and Hungary. Last month, Putin accused Sofia of delaying the building of the pipeline on its territory and said Moscow could find ways to bypass Bulgaria if needed.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Source", "Agencies", "Utc January"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  9 07:30:31 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The presidents of Turkey and Russia yesterday formally launched the TurkStream pipeline which will carry Russian natural gas to southern Europe through Turkey, part of Moscow\u2019s efforts to reduce shipments", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"article": {"published_time": "2020-01-09T07:30:31+08:00"}, "og": {"imageShare": "http://www.shanghaidaily.com/images/logo.png", "type": "website", "title": "New Russian pipeline to supply Europe with gas", "description": "The presidents of Turkey and Russia yesterday formally launched the TurkStream pipeline which will carry Russian natural gas to southern Europe through Turkey, part of Moscow\u2019s efforts to reduce shipments", "image": "http://www.shanghaidaily.com/images/mzl.dlomxgvi.png"}, "description": "The presidents of Turkey and Russia yesterday formally launched the TurkStream pipeline which will carry Russian natural gas to southern Europe through Turkey, part of Moscow\u2019s efforts to reduce shipments", "twitter": {"url": "https://archive.shine.cn/archive/world/New-Russian-pipeline-to-supply-Europe-with-gas/shdaily.shtml", "title": "New Russian pipeline to supply Europe with gas", "description": "The presidents of Turkey and Russia yesterday formally launched the TurkStream pipeline which will carry Russian natural gas to southern Europe through Turkey, part of Moscow\u2019s efforts to reduce shipments", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.shanghaidaily.com/images/mzl.dlomxgvi.png", "alt": "New Russian pipeline to supply Europe with gas"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "canonical_link": "https://archive.shine.cn/world/New-Russian-pipeline-to-supply-Europe-with-gas/shdaily.shtml"}
