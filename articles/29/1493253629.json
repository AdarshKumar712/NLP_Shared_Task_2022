The charge also applies to hotels, apartments, campsites and rented private accommodations such as Airbnb.\n\nHotels will charge 3 euros (US$3.34) per night, per person, while those who want to stay in camping sites have to pay an extra 1 euro per person, per night.\n\nAdditionally, the tax rate for rented private accommodations has increased by 10 percent.\n\nRead also: Amsterdam removes iconic \u2018I Amsterdam\u2019 sign due to overcrowding\n\nThe same regulation is applied to sea and river cruise operators, as well. They will be charged 8 euro for each passenger who only stops over and isn\u2019t a resident of the city.\n\nThough Amsterdam has been threatened by overcrowding, a representative from the Amsterdam city council told CNN.com the reasons behind the tax hike and scaring off tourists was not one of them.\n\n\u201cVisitors will contribute more to the high costs of keeping the city safe and clean, and of keeping the public place like pavements, quays, bridges and streets in a good state,\u201d said the representative.\n\nAccording to lonelyplanet.com, Amsterdam is the latest addition to a list of cities that have implemented a tourist tax, such as Paris and Rome. Another city to follow suit this summer is Venice, Italy.
