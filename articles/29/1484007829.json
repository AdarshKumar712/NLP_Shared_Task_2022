Plastic production has surged in the last 50 years, leading to the widespread use of inexpensive disposable products that are having a devastating effect on the environment, cluttering beaches and choking marine wildlife.\n\nPlastic also does not biodegrade. Instead, it breaks down into smaller pieces, and ultimately ends up everywhere, including in the food chain.\n\n\"We do not fully know what impact this ingestion of micro and nano-sized plastic particles has on our health\", said Thava Palanisami of Australias University of Newcastle, who worked on the WWF study.\n\nIn a week, we ingest a plastic bottle caps worth, and in six months, we consume a cereal bowl full. At this rate of consumption, in a decade, we could be eating 2.5 kg in plastic, which might not seem like a huge amount, but it can add up. Over a lifetime, we consume about 20 kg (44 lb) of microplastic.\n\nMENAFN0101202000630000ID1099494666", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["(MENAFN", "Peninsula)", "Geneva", "modern", "scientific", "study", "showed", "that", "humans", "consume", "abundant", "amount", "plastic", "mainly", "what is my ip", "SEO", "Real Estate", "what time is it", "free fire vs pubg", ""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"Description": "(MENAFN - The Peninsula) QNA   Geneva  - A modern scientific study showed that humans consume abundant amount of plastic mainly in drinking water, through the respiratory system, or via sources like seafood, every week.\nAccording to a study by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), researchers discovered the existence of microscopic", "keywords": "(MENAFN, Peninsula), Geneva, modern, scientific, study, showed, that, humans, consume, abundant, amount, plastic, mainly, what is my ip ,SEO ,Real Estate ,what time is it ,free fire vs pubg ,", "news_keywords": "(MENAFN, Peninsula), Geneva, modern, scientific, study, showed, that, humans, consume, abundant, amount, plastic, mainly, what is my ip ,SEO ,Real Estate ,what time is it ,free fire vs pubg ,", "og": {"description": "(MENAFN - The Peninsula) QNA   Geneva  - A modern scientific study showed that humans consume abundant amount of plastic mainly in drinking water, through the respiratory system, or via sources like seafood, every week.\nAccording to a study by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), researchers discovered the existence of microscopic", "title": "Qatar- Scientific Study Show Amount of Plastic We Eat Weekly", "type": "article", "url": "https://menafn.com/1099494666/Qatar-Scientific-Study-Show-Amount-of-Plastic-We-Eat-Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2020-01/01/TP_5749e7d4-9image_story.jpg", "width": 300}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@menafn", "id": 65910734}, "creator": {"identifier": "@menafn", "id": 65910734}, "description": "(MENAFN - The Peninsula) QNA   Geneva  - A modern scientific study showed that humans consume abundant amount of plastic mainly in drinking water, through the respiratory system, or via sources like seafood, every week.\nAccording to a study by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), researchers discovered the existence of microscopic", "title": "Qatar- Scientific Study Show Amount of Plastic We Eat Weekly", "url": "https://menafn.com/1099494666/Qatar-Scientific-Study-Show-Amount-of-Plastic-We-Eat-Weekly", "image": {"src": "https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2020-01/01/TP_5749e7d4-9image_story.jpg"}}, "author": "MENAFN", "resource-type": "document", "distribution": "global", "robots": "index, follow", "rating": "general", "y_key": "63f5d0c14b50c6c7", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "https://menafn.com/1099494666/Qatar-Scientific-Study-Show-Amount-of-Plastic-We-Eat-Weekly"}
