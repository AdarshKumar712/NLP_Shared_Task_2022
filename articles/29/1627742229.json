It also called on the German parliament and government to challenge the ECB on the matter.\n\nThe ruling poses a conundrum for Berlin, which is bound to respect the Karlsruhe court but at the same time does not want to erode the independence of the ECB, whose unprecedented economic stimulus program has kept the euro zone intact.\n\nThe Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said in an advance release from Sunday\u2019s edition that an idea floated by Sven Simon, a member of the European Parliament with Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU), was emerging as a potential solution.\n\nSimon has suggested that the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament in Berlin, should demand a statement of clarification from the European Parliament, rather than the ECB.\n\nUnlike national parliaments, the European Parliament has the right to put questions to the ECB, and the ECB president gives testimony to the European legislature in regular hearings.\n\nSimon has therefore written to the ECB asking it to make its internal deliberations on the effects of its policy action public. If it did so, it would, in Simon\u2019s view, make it clear that it had in fact carried out the audit that Karlsruhe requires, the newspaper reported. The bank is obliged to reply.\n\nThe CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) support the proposal, along with their Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners, and the opposition Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP), the paper added.
