One would think the party could learn something from this, but a party insider thinks this is unlikely. EURACTIV Germany reports.\n\nFor Austria\u2019s social democracy, it was a \u2018red spark of hope\u2019 in what has been quite a dark period for the party. While the SP\u00d6 has been losing elections for months, it was able to increase its voter count by 8% in the Burgenland state elections, where it now holds an absolute majority of 49.94%.\n\nOvernight, top candidate Hans-Peter Doskozil became a beacon of hope for the SP\u00d6. And if the party wants to start winning elections in 2020 in the hope of \u2018making a comeback\u2019, it may just want to learn a thing or two from this victory.\n\nThe state of the Social Democratic Party is \u201cdesolate and disastrous\u201d, a party insider, who wants to remain anonymous, told EURACTIV. From obtaining the worst result in the party\u2019s history in the legislative elections of 2019 (21.2 %), it plummeted to 16% in the polls.\n\nAustrian socialists and right-wing populists doing poorly in polls Austria\u2019s government of experts is now in place. Now the question arises: when should a new government be elected? An analysis by Herbert Vytiska.\n\nYet, it is said that the party leadership is not capable of reform, that critical voices and new ideas are not heard. Although reform had been announced for 2020, the insider had little hope for it.\n\nApart from the general lack of will to change, discussions are also avoided, in order to be perceived as a united front. However, this hardly ever succeeds, and chairwoman Pamela Rendi-Wagner, in particular, is often criticised from within her ranks.\n\nDoskozil\u2019s SP\u00d6 in Burgenland, however, has succeeded in making a united appearance, which voters saw as conveying stability. In general, it was Doskozil himself who influenced the votes, according to a study by the opinion research institute SORA.\n\n\u201cThis was not a victory of the SP\u00d6, but Doskozil,\u201d the insider said.\n\nThe crisis manager from next door\n\nWhile the federal SP\u00d6 struggles to address both liberal academics and workers, Doskozil positions himself as an ordinary man. He doesn\u2019t care \u201cif left-wing elites like what we do,\u201d he told Austrian broadcaster ORF.\n\nHe has also distanced himself from the image of a tactical politician.\n\nWhen the SP\u00d6 discussed the new social democratic narrative after the 2019 election defeat, he told daily newspaper DER STANDARD: \u201cNarrative! I can\u2019t hear the word anymore!\u201d\n\nBesides, Doskozil was already able to prove his competence as a crisis manager. When hundreds of thousands of people were coming to Austria via Burgenland in 2015, the then head of the provincial police, Doskozil, coordinated the emergency forces.\n\nAt that time he said in an interview with the KURIER: \u201cIf I were in the position of a refugee \u2013 even if I were an economic refugee \u2013 and saw how much better life is in Europe, I would flee too\u201d.\n\n'We wanted to stop the right-wing authoritarian trend,' says Green Austrian MP In an interview with EURACTIV Germany, Green Austrian MP Lukas Hammer spoke about his party\u2019s negotiations with the Austrian People\u2019s Party (\u00d6VP) while drafting the coalition agreement and why his party took the risk of accepting tough migration policies in exchange for increased climate protection.\n\nThe SP\u00d6\u2019s right-leaning faction\n\nBut a lot has changed since then.\n\nDoskozil became defence minister in January 2016 and, in January 2019, Burgenland\u2019s new governor. As his roles changed, so did his rhetoric on migration and asylum.\n\nIn a strategy paper entitled \u201cIntegration before immigration\u201d, Doskozil called for the protection of those eligible for asylum, but also for quicker deportations, emphasising that \u201cthose seeking protection can best be helped close to their countries of origin\u201d.\n\nThis is why Doskozil is often considered to be part of the more right-leaning faction of the SP\u00d6. But also because he, as Burgenland\u2019s governor, had formed a coalition with the far-right FP\u00d6, which he told EURACTIV was a \u201creliable government partner\u201d. And this completely contradicts the relations between the SP\u00d6 and the FP\u00d6 at the federal level.\n\nRight turn for Federal SP\u00d6?\n\nIn comparison to the SP\u00d6 at the federal level, Doskozil stands for \u201cleft-wing social policy and more restrictive security policy\u201d, said the party insider, explaining that this would be the right course for the party.\n\nCurrently, it has the image of a (pro)\u201dimmigrant party\u201d, but \u201cin more right-wing parts of the country\u201d one should no longer be perceived this way, the insider added. Although people should be granted asylum, the SP\u00d6 should also communicate \u201cthat we are against open borders and do not stand for children wearing headscarves\u201d.\n\nDoskozil also told EURACTIV he expects the SP\u00d6 to \u201ctake a very close look at what can be learnt from our successful path\u201d at the federal level because \u201csocial democracy must manage the balancing act between social and security issues\u201d.\n\nDoskozil already gave an example of this: On the very evening of winning the election, he said in a TV interview that the SP\u00d6 should reconsider its rejection of the government\u2019s planned preventive detention.\n\nAustria's new conservative-Green coalition enthusiastic about climate and Europe Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has formed what is now his second ruling coalition, this time between his conservative \u00d6VP party and the Greens, replacing the interim government of experts. Although the new government is set to make Austria a climate pioneer, there are question marks as to how long the new alliance is likely to last. EURACTIV Germany reports.\n\nLeadership question after elections in Vienna\n\nHowever, the insider fears that hope for real reform is limited. Losing the elections in socialist-run Vienna, set for autumn 2020, would deal a final deathblow to the SP\u00d6. And since the party wants to appear united until then, it is unlikely to discuss new ideas.\n\nThis means the leadership question will come up after the Vienna election \u2013 but, according to the insider, this will be done relatively safely.\n\nIn case of an election debacle, Rendi-Wagner would be branded a \u201closer\u201d.\n\nIf, however, Vienna\u2019s mayor Michael Ludwig wins the Vienna election, the party\u2019s power will emanate from the three socialist governors: Doskozil, Ludwig and Peter Kaiser in Carinthia.\n\nAnd even if none of them run, they will likely be the ones deciding new leadership.\n\nStrache prepares his political comeback following Austrian corruption scandal The guessing games have come to an end as Austria\u2019s former Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache announced on Monday (17 June) he will remain politically active in Vienna and won\u2019t take up his MEP seat in Brussels.
