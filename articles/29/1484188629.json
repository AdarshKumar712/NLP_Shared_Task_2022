The stolen animals were worth about $1.6 million, one worker told KABC.\n\nNeighbor James Aiken told KABC that he looked out his window and saw the llamas gallivanting down the street.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s kind of strange,'\u201d he said.\n\nThe farm, which sits on 14 acres, houses other animals such as ostriches, alpacas, emus and water buffalo. The farm has been targeted on social media by activists who claim the animals are being abused and neglected.\n\nWhile the Riverside County code enforcement department is working with the property owner regarding violations on some overgrown land, animal control found no evidence of mistreatment after several visits, stating that the animals appear to be in good health and are watered and fed regularly, KABC reported.\n\nAnimal control spokesman John Welsh told the Riverside Press Enterprise that the \u201crage on social media\u201d prompted the department to send investigators to the property \u201calmost every day\u201d over the last week and a half. The caretakers started putting the feed near the property line to prove the animals were being cared for after a \u201cpublic sideshow\u201d resulted from the social media claims, he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a well-kept property, but we don\u2019t have any evidence of animal abuse or neglect, whatsoever,\u201d Welsh told the local newspaper.\n\nAbout 355 birds and hoofed animals live on the property, Welsh said.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020, ABC Audio.
