\u2014 Cyprus\u2019 attorney general said Tuesday he couldn\u2019t suspend the trial of a 19 year-old British woman found guilty of lying about being gang raped by as many as dozen Israelis because she had leveled \u201cgrave accusations\u201d against police investigators that had to be adjudicated in court.\n\nCostas Clerides said the woman\u2019s allegation that police coerced her into retracting her rape claim \u201ccould not have been left to linger\u201d so he could not move to suspend the trial.\n\nClerides also said the woman\u2019s insistence that she didn\u2019t get a fair trial is \u201cessentially a legal-constitutional matter\u201d that a courtof law must rule on.\n\n\u201cAny intervention on the part of the attorney general, either for reasons of public interest or any other reasons, would have constituted nothing more than an obstacle to ascertaining the true facts of the case, as well as interference in the judiciary\u2019s work,\u201d Clerides said in a statement.\n\nThe woman, who hasn\u2019t been named was found guilty on Monday on a charge of public mischief and is due to be sentenced Jan. 7. The charge carries a maximum of a year in prison and a fine of 1,700 euros ($1, 907).\n\nShe insists that she was raped in a hotel room at a coastal resort town on July 17 and that she was forced to sign the retraction 10 days later while under police questioning. Her lawyers said they would appeal the decision, citing the judge\u2019s refusal to consider evidence that she had been raped.\n\nFamagusta District Court Judge Michalis Papathanasiou said the defendant didn\u2019t tell the truth and tried to deceive the court with \u201cevasive\u201d statements in her testimony.\n\nThe judge said the woman had admitted to investigators that she made up the claims because she was \u201cashamed\u201d after finding out that some of the Israelis had videoed her having consensual sex with her Israeli boyfriend on their mobile phones.\n\nDuring the trial, defense lawyers had called the police investigation deficient and improper, with detectives making major lapses and omissions in their work while having a mistaken perception of the true facts surrounding their client\u2019s claim.\n\nClerides issued the statement following revelations that two former attorneys general and others had sent him a written appeal last month to suspend the case so as not to damage Cyprus\u2019 image abroad.\n\nThe British government on Monday cast doubt over whether the teenager received a fair trial and said that it would raise the issue with Cypriot authorities.\n\nCyprus\u2019 government spokesman Kyriakos Kousios said the government doesn\u2019t intervene or comment on pending court cases, saying it has \u201cfull confidence in the justice system and the courts,\u201d which should be left unfettered to implement the law and deliver justice.\n\n\u2014\n\nBy MENELAOS HADJICOSTIS Associated Press", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 10:59:30 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://img.ekirikas.com/g4asyb4-UgbjvThZ/w:auto/h:auto/q:auto/https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monogram-1.svg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Cyprus' Top Lawyer Says Rape Case Trial Must Run Its Course", "description": "NICOSIA (AP) \u2014 Cyprus' attorney general said Tuesday he couldn't suspend the trial of a 19 year-old British woman found guilty of lying about being gang raped by as many as dozen Israelis because she had leveled \u201cgrave accusations\u201d against police investigators that had to be adjudicated in court.\r\nC", "url": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/cyprus-top-lawyer-says-rape-case-trial-must-run-its-course/", "site_name": "The National Herald", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.ekirikas.com/g4asyb4-udJi4dKN/w:auto/h:auto/q:auto/https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ap19364327756329_15_0_type13265.jpg", "url": "https://img.ekirikas.com/g4asyb4-udJi4dKN/w:auto/h:auto/q:auto/https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ap19364327756329_15_0_type13265.jpg", "secure_url": "https://img.ekirikas.com/g4asyb4-udJi4dKN/w:auto/h:auto/q:auto/https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ap19364327756329_15_0_type13265.jpg"}, "updated_time": "2021-11-11T05:42:53-05:00"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationalHerald/", "published_time": "2020-01-02T05:59:30-05:00", "modified_time": "2021-11-11T05:42:53-05:00", "section": "Society"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@NationalHerald", "site": "@NationalHerald", "label1": "Est. reading time", "data1": "2 minutes", "title": "Cyprus' Top Lawyer Says Rape Case Trial Must Run Its Course", "url": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/cyprus-top-lawyer-says-rape-case-trial-must-run-its-course/", "description": "NICOSIA (AP) \u2014 Cyprus' attorney general said Tuesday he couldn't suspend the trial of a 19 year-old British woman found guilty of lying about being gang raped by as many as dozen Israelis because she had leveled \u201cgrave accusations\u201d against police investigators that had to be adjudicated in court.\r\nC", "image": "https://img.ekirikas.com/g4asyb4-udJi4dKN/w:auto/h:auto/q:auto/https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ap19364327756329_15_0_type13265.jpg"}, "generator": "Optimole 3.2.1", "facebook-domain-verification": "1h9tpy2c8iperyje0m8fdqdqkaptlt", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://img.ekirikas.com/g4asyb4-UgbjvThZ/w:auto/h:auto/q:auto/https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monogram-1.svg"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/cyprus-top-lawyer-says-rape-case-trial-must-run-its-course/"}
