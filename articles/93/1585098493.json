The large crowds came despite Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s order to stay at home in order to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nAnd now, state officials are cracking down at popular beaches. On Monday evening, Governor Newsom ordered closures of many state park beaches and parking lots \u2013 primarily in San Diego County and Central California \u2013 in an effort to discourage large congregations of beachgoers. Additionally, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer has shut down city beaches and Point Reyes in Marin County has closed until at least April 7th. As for Orange County, the situation is varied; Laguna Beach, Seal Beach, and Huntington Beach (starting Wednesday, March 25th) have closed beach parking lots and in some cases beach access.\n\n\u201cBefore we wanted people to have the opportunity of walking on the beach while maintaining social distancing. It looks like people are not able to do that so we will be issuing an amendment to our public order that if jurisdictions are not able to enforce social gathering, we will close beaches. And that amendment to our health order will be issued later today [Monday],\u201d said San Diego County Public Health Officer Dr. Wilma Wooten.\n\nAs of now, it\u2019s unclear if the directive prohibits surfing at effected beaches. For instance, surfers were still in the lineup at Malibu (watch the live cam here) on Tuesday morning, and that\u2019s one of the beaches on the list.\n\nSimilar beach closures have been issued on the East Coast and in the Caribbean, as we reported last week, with the strictest restrictions in Puerto Rico. In another post from last week, we expounded on the dangers of surfing during the coronavirus pandemic (TL;DR: it\u2019s still unclear if the virus can spread in saltwater, and official guidelines are to keep as much distance from other people as possible\u2026even in the water). And surfers in various parts of Europe are being fined for going in the water.\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to update this story as more develops.\n\nHere\u2019s the list of state beaches with closed parking lots:\n\nSan Mateo County:\n\nA\u00f1o Nuevo SP\n\nBean Hollow SB\n\nCowell Ranch\n\nGray Whale Cove SB\n\nHalf Moon Bay SB\n\nMontara SB\n\nPescadero SB\n\nPigeon Point Light Station SHP\n\nPomponio SB\n\nSan Gregorio SB\n\nMarin County:\n\nTomales Bay SP\n\nPoint Reyes\n\nSonoma County:\n\nSonoma Coast SP (and associated sub-units)\n\nSonoma State SHP\n\nSanta Cruz County\n\nManresa SB\n\nNatural Bridges SB\n\nNew Brighton SB\n\nSeacliff SB\n\nMonterey County\n\nAndrew Molera SP\n\nCarmel River SB\n\nJulia Pfeiffer Burns SP\n\nMonterey SB\n\nPoint Lobos SNR\n\nVentura County\n\nMandalay SB\n\nPoint Mugu SP\n\nSan Buenaventura SB\n\nSanta Barbara County\n\nCarpinteria SB\n\nEl Capitan SB\n\nGaviota SP\n\nRefugio SB\n\nSan Luis Obispo County\n\n\n\nCayucos SB\n\nMorro Strand SB\n\nPismo SB\n\nLos Angeles County:\n\nLeo Carrillo State Park (SP)\n\nMalibu Creek SP\n\nMalibu Lagoon State Beach (SB)\n\nPoint Dume SB\n\nPoint Mugu SP\n\nRH Meyer SB\n\nTopanga SP\n\nWill Rogers State Historic Park (SHP)\n\nOrange County:\n\nBolsa Chica SB\n\nCrystal Cove SP\n\nDoheny SB\n\nHuntington SB\n\nSan Clemente SB\n\nSan Diego County:\n\nTorrey Pines State Natural Reserve\n\nCarlsbad SB\n\nSouth Carlsbad SB\n\nSan Onofre SB", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Coronavirus"], "authors": ["Dashel Pierson", "Mar"], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 24 18:58:23 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Closures issued at major surf spots to curb COVID-19 \u2013 from San Diego to Central California", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://wa.cdn-surfline.com/quiver/0.4.0/apple/surfline-apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Closures issued at major surf spots to curb COVID-19 \u2013 from San Diego to Central California", "og": {"type": "Article", "site_name": "Surfline", "title": "California State Beaches Close Due to Coronavirus", "url": "https://www.surfline.com/surf-news/california-state-beaches-close-due-coronavirus/81308", "image": "https://d14fqx6aetz9ka.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/07084810/klein_malibu_july2017_01901-1560x1040.jpg", "description": "Closures issued at major surf spots to curb COVID-19 \u2013 from San Diego to Central California", "updated_time": "2020-03-28T00:59:39+00:00"}, "canonical": "https://www.surfline.com/surf-news/california-state-beaches-close-due-coronavirus/81308", "article": {"section": "Breaking", "published_time": "2020-03-24T18:58:23+00:00", "updated_time": "2020-03-28T00:59:39+00:00", "tag": "Coronavirus"}, "twitter": {"card": "Closures issued at major surf spots to curb COVID-19 \u2013 from San Diego to Central California", "title": "California State Beaches Close Due to Coronavirus", "image": "https://d14fqx6aetz9ka.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/07084810/klein_malibu_july2017_01901-1560x1040.jpg", "description": "Closures issued at major surf spots to curb COVID-19 \u2013 from San Diego to Central California", "url": "https://www.surfline.com/surf-news/california-state-beaches-close-due-coronavirus/81308"}, "fb": {"app_id": 218714858155230, "page_id": 255110695512}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=393782096,affiliate-data=at=1000lb9Z&ct=surfline-website-smart-banner&pt=261378"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.surfline.com/surf-news/california-state-beaches-close-due-coronavirus/81308"}
