They are far-reaching, but at the moment they are necessary.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Steinmeier called on Germans to \"work together to ensure the virus spreads as slowly as possible\".\n\n\"So wherever possible: stay at home! Avoid close contact... and have understanding for all restrictive measures,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe sweeping restrictions aimed at \"limiting social contact in public places\" will leave most sites from museums to swimming pools to gyms shuttered.\n\nBut supermarkets, banks and post offices will stay open, as will pharmacies and petrol stations.\n\nHairdressers, construction supply stores and laundromats will also keep operating, the government said.\n\nRestaurants and cafes can stay open, but only until 6 pm daily.\n\nHotels will only be used for \"essential and explicitly not for tourist purposes\", the government added.\n\nAuthorities had last week ordered schools shut, and regional trains have been curtailed in a bid to reduce travel.\n\nGermany also from Monday re-introduced checks on its borders with Austria, France, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Denmark, turning back motorists without an essential reason to enter Germany.\n\nWith most of Europe now in lockdown, and stock markets in a tailspin, Berlin on Friday promised companies \"unlimited\" credit to keep them afloat.\n\nThe economic package is worth at least 550 billion euros ($614 billion) initially -- the biggest in Germany's post-war history.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Mar 16 20:13:42 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "German leaders on Monday urged citizens to stay home, as the government announced unprecedented nationwide measures to radically scale back public life in order to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
