Our sense of touch lets us feel whether we have a firm grasp on the object or if it\u2019s about to slip through our fingers, so we can adjust the strength of our grip accordingly. Robot grippers tasked with picking up objects that are fragile or slippery or have a complex surface also require this kind of feedback.\n\nRobotics researchers at ETH Zurich have now developed a tactile sensor that could come in handy in just such an instance \u2013 and marks what they see as a significant step towards \u201crobotic skin.\u201d The sensor\u2019s extremely simple design makes it inexpensive to produce, as the engineers point out. Essentially, it consists of an elastic silicone \u201cskin\u201d with colored plastic microbeads and a regular camera affixed to the underside.\n\nMeasurements using purely optical input\n\nThe sensor is vision-\u200bbased: when it comes into contact with an object, an indentation appears in the silicone skin. This changes the pattern of the microbeads, which is registered by the fisheye lens on the underside of the sensor. From those changes to the pattern, it is possible to calculate the force distribution on the sensor.\n\nRelated: This tactile robot finger is first without blind spots\n\n\u201cConventional sensors register the applied force at only a single point. By contrast, our robotic skin lets us distinguish between several forces acting on the sensor surface, and calculate them with high degrees of resolution and accuracy,\u201d said Carlo Sferrazza. He is a doctoral student in the group led by Raffaello D\u2019Andrea, Professor of Dynamic Systems and Control at ETH Zurich. \u201cWe can even determine the direction from which a force is acting.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the researchers can identify not only forces that exert vertical pressure on the sensor, but also shear forces, which act laterally.\n\nData-\u200bdriven development of tactile sensor\n\nTo calculate which forces push the microbeads in which directions, the engineers use a comprehensive set of experimental data: in tests that were standardized through machine control, they examined a variety of different kinds of contact with the sensor. They were able to precisely control and systematically vary the location of the contact, the force distribution and the size of the object making contact.\n\nWith the help of machine learning, the researchers recorded several thousand instances of contact and precisely matched them with changes in the bead pattern.\n\nThe thinnest sensor prototype the researchers have built so far is 1.7 centimeters thick and covers a measurement surface of 5 by 5 centimeters. However, the researchers are working on using the same technique to realize larger sensor surfaces that are equipped with several cameras, and can thus also recognise objects of complex shape. In addition, they aim to make the sensor thinner \u2013 they believe it is possible to achieve a thickness of just 0.5 centimeters using existing technology.\n\nRobotics, sport and virtual reality\n\nBecause the elastic silicone is non-\u200bslip and the sensor can measure shear forces, the tactile sensor is well suited for use in robot gripper arms. \u201cThe sensor would recognize when an object threatens to slip out of the arm\u2019s grasp so the robot can adjust its grip strength,\u201d Sferrazza explained.\n\nResearchers could also use such a sensor to test the hardness of materials or to digitally map touches. If integrated into wearables, cyclists could measure how much force they are applying to the bike through the pedals, or runners could measure the force that goes into their shoes when jogging. Lastly, such sensors can provide information important to developing tactile feedback, for example for virtual reality games.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This article was republished from ETH Zurich.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["COVID-19"], "authors": ["Fabio Bergamin"], "publish_date": "Mon Mar 16 18:39:18 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "With the help of machine learning, researchers built a tactile sensor to measure force distribution, enabling robot arms to grasp fragile objects.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://20kh6h3g46l33ivuea3rxuyu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cropped-robot-report-site-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 107031532675062}, "msvalidate.01": "40BA1B879066C83CDFCA374CA4B490C3", "description": "With the help of machine learning, researchers built a tactile sensor to measure force distribution, enabling robot arms to grasp fragile objects.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Machine learning helps researchers build tactile sensor for robots", "description": "With the help of machine learning, researchers built a tactile sensor to measure force distribution, enabling robot arms to grasp fragile objects.", "url": "https://www.therobotreport.com/machine-learning-researchers-tactile-sensor-robots/", "site_name": "The Robot Report", "updated_time": "2020-03-16T18:52:21+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.imageformat.fullwidth.1011702760.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.imageformat.fullwidth.1011702760.jpg", "width": 930, "height": 465}}, "article": {"tag": "Tactile Sensors", "section": "End Effectors / Grippers", "published_time": "2020-03-16T18:39:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-16T18:52:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "With the help of machine learning, researchers built a tactile sensor to measure force distribution, enabling robot arms to grasp fragile objects.", "title": "Machine learning helps researchers build tactile sensor for robots", "site": "@therobotreport", "image": "https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.imageformat.fullwidth.1011702760.jpg", "creator": "@therobotreport"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cropped-robot-report-site-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.therobotreport.com/machine-learning-researchers-tactile-sensor-robots/"}
