Jets coach Adam Gase said they began looking at what was causing all the injuries about two months ago.\n\n\u201cI wish it was cut and dry and say, \u2018Hey we had 15 hamstrings,\u2019 \u201d Gase said. \u201cBut we\u2019re having season-ending-type injuries. We\u2019ve had discussions with the training room, strength and conditioning; [general manager] Joe [Douglas] and I have had conversations; we\u2019ve talked to other people. We\u2019re going to continue to take deeper dives and all that when we meet with the staff as far as was it practice schedule, training camp, offseason. Is it something we\u2019re doing during the season? We\u2019re combing through everything because we can\u2019t have this happen again.\u201d\n\nThe Jets had a staggering amount of injuries. Here are some eye-popping numbers:\n\nThey used a franchise-record 73 players. Only the Dolphins and Redskins used more this season.\n\nThey had 20 players wind up on injured reserve.\n\nThey used 11 starting offensive linemen. They had nine starting combinations on the line. They had three starters each at left guard and right guard.\n\nThey used four quarterbacks and three starting quarterbacks. It was the first time since 2005 they had four quarterbacks take a snap.\n\nFour players viewed as key starters in the preseason ended up playing two games or less \u2014 ILB C.J. Mosley (2 games), TE Chris Herndon (1 game), WR Quincy Enunwa (1 game) and ILB Avery Williamson (0 games).\n\nThe Jets used six starting cornerbacks on the outside (not counting nickel corner Brian Poole). They used five starting inside linebackers.\n\nAll of this contributed to the Jets\u2019 7-9 season. They failed to overcome many of these injuries in the first half of the season but handled them much better in the second half.\n\nsee also Jets' Joe Douglas is on the clock Thirty miles east of Jets headquarters and two hours before...\n\nThe Jets need to consider whether changes need to be made to their medical or strength and conditioning staffs, although Gase indicated that is highly unlikely.\n\nPractice rules in the NFL are highly regulated by the collective bargaining agreement. There are limits on offseason practices and how often you can wear pads in practice. That makes it unlikely Gase is running practice any differently than other teams when it comes to contact and the length of practices.\n\n\u201cWithout having all of the facts, my initial thought is that this year is a bit of anomaly as far as the amount of injuries that we sustained as an organization, as a team,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cWe are in the midst of that research; we are doing a deep dive to as far to what we can do to prevent this from happening again and what we need to implement to make sure that this amount of injuries doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nThe Jets have plenty of priorities this offseason. Figuring out a solution to their injury issue, if there is one, should be near the top of the list.\n\nFor more on the Jets, listen to the latest episode of the \u201cGang\u2019s All Here\u201d podcast:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Football", "adam gase", "chris herndon", "cj mosley", "Joe Douglas", "new york jets"], "tags": ["cj mosley", "chris herndon", "adam gase", "Joe Douglas", "new york jets"], "authors": ["January"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Jets injury problem was so bad in 2019 that the trainer\u2019s room barely had enough space for all of the rehabbing players, who had to schedule their times with trainers to avoid a logjam.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/nypost-2016/static/images/apple-icons/nypost/apple-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
