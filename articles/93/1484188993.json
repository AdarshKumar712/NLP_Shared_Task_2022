It served as several vehicle showrooms prior to Gutbertlet and survived an explosion in 1914 when it operated as a garage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long process and a lot of work getting a 100-year building converted from a garage to a restaurant,\u201d said Blake, noting working as a family on construction is nothing new\u2013and hoping the business appeals both to local historians and visitors to the town.\n\nIn the last year, Morgan County has seen several restaurants close, including breakfast/lunch options like Kenny\u2019s and The River Queen.\n\n\u201cWe are all hopeful they get it open soon and are successful,\u201d said Adam Shriver, who not only runs Twin City Opera House in McConnelsville but also serves as a Morgan County commissioner.\n\nRecent closures don\u2019t scare the Ponchaks since they own not only the brewery building but also the location of a Mexican restaurant opening across the parking lot and plan a partnership with Maxwell\u2019s Pizza.\n\n\u201cBoth Maxwell\u2019s and El Palenque will deliver right to your table once we\u2019re open,\u201d said Dean. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve already held some small weddings in the banquet space and plan to use this as both a special event area and a place for overflow if we get really busy.\u201d\n\nDean and Jennifer Ponchak learned to brew (at a larger scale than the home brewing Dean has practiced for the last few years since retirement from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency) through an immersion learning course in Colorado.\n\n\u201cWe went to beer school and part of that immersion is working in a brewery\u2013learning how that runs and we get to use the recipes we practiced there,\u201d Dean said. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked the red ales and a stout, but out there in Brighton we even learned to make this raspberry hibiscus beer and fruity isn\u2019t usually what I gravitate to but it was pretty good.\u201d\n\nBlake said his favorite brew thus far is a session IPA his dad makes, one of the four staples the family plans to have on tap once it opens.\n\n\u201cI hope people walk in, look around and see how this 100-year-old building has grown from what it was beforehand, and hopefully now is a place for people to want to go on a weekend or when they get off work,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest thing is you have to have good beer, as long as we have good beer anybody can enjoy it.\u201d\n\nDean said he hopes to capture brewery tourists en route from Zanesville, Athens and Marietta as well.\n\n\u201cWe are within about 30 miles of all of these and the interstate. I want a place where you can come, relax and enjoy a drink with me in my version of retirement,\u201d he said.\n\nThe brewery is anticipated to open by spring, with an approximately 160-person capacity space.\n\nTo stay updated on progress, follow the business on Facebook.\n\nJanelle Patterson can be reached at jpatterson@mariettatimes.com.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Business", "Brewery to open in McConnelsville in 2020Local News", "Brewery to open in McConnelsville in 2020News", "Brewery to open in McConnelsville in 2020"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "McCONNELSVILLE, Ohio \u2014From building to brewing, the Ponchak family is on track for an early 2020 opening for its newest business venture.  \u201cMcConnelsville", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.newsandsentinel.com/wp-content/themes/coreV2/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 139748349392634}, "og": {"title": "Brewery to open in McConnelsville in 2020", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/ogden_images/www.newsandsentinel.com/images/2019/12/28235348/12-29-19-Brewery-1-tle-1100x734.jpg", "width\"": 1100, "height\"": 734, "secure_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/ogden_images/www.newsandsentinel.com/images/2019/12/28235348/12-29-19-Brewery-1-tle-1100x734.jpg"}, "url": "https://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/business/2019/12/brewery-to-open-in-mcconnelsville-in-2020/", "site_name": "newsandsentinel.com/", "description": "McCONNELSVILLE, Ohio \u2014From building to brewing, the Ponchak family is on track for an early 2020 opening for its newest business venture. \u201cMcConnelsville is making a comeback,\u201d said Dean Ponchak, as he walked through a brick building that sits north of the village square on West Main Street directly across the street from not only [\u2026]", "locale": {"identifier": "en_US", "alternate": "en_US"}}, "twitter": {"site": "@newsandsentinel", "title": "Brewery to open in McConnelsville in 2020", "description": "McCONNELSVILLE, Ohio \u2014From building to brewing, the Ponchak family is on track for an early 2020 opening for its newest business venture. \u201cMcConnelsville is making a comeback,\u201d said Dean Ponchak, as he walked through a brick building that sits north of the village square on West Main Street directly across the street from not only [\u2026]", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/ogden_images/www.newsandsentinel.com/images/2019/12/28235348/12-29-19-Brewery-1-tle-1100x734.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "McCONNELSVILLE, Ohio \u2014From building to brewing, the Ponchak family is on track for an early 2020 opening for its newest business venture.  \u201cMcConnelsville", "keywords": "Business,Brewery to open in McConnelsville in 2020Local News,Brewery to open in McConnelsville in 2020News,Brewery to open in McConnelsville in 2020", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.5"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/business/2019/12/brewery-to-open-in-mcconnelsville-in-2020/"}
