So if the oceans are abnormally high, then Hawaii\u2019s temperatures will be abnormally high.\u201d\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said June 2019 was the hottest June on record in its 140-year history, with an average global temperature 1.71 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th-century average of 59.9 degrees.\n\nThe Hawaiian region recorded its highest June temperature departure from average.\n\nEven in December, when temperatures cooled down, record highs and matches continued to be logged, mostly in Kahului and Lihue, but also in Honolulu.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Politics", "Columnists", "Odd News", "Volcano Coverage"], "authors": ["Nina Wu Nwu Staradvertiser.Com"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/themes/staradvertiser/images/sa-favicon-16x16.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "fb": {"pages": 112299605447935}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "More than 270 record high temperatures, ties recorded in Hawaii in 2019", "description": "There were 272 record high temperatures and ties logged in Hawaii during the year of 2019, according to preliminary numbers from the National Weather Service.", "url": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/12/31/hawaii-news/newswatch/more-than-270-record-high-temperatures-ties-recorded-in-hawaii-in-2019/", "site_name": "Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "updated_time": "2020-01-01T10:04:27-10:00", "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/web1_CTY-hot-10776-300x178.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/staradvertiser/", "section": "Newswatch", "published_time": "2020-01-01T03:25:00-10:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T10:04:27-10:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "There were 272 record high temperatures and ties logged in Hawaii during the year of 2019, according to preliminary numbers from the National Weather Service.", "title": "More than 270 record high temperatures, ties recorded in Hawaii in 2019 | Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "site": "@staradvertiser", "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/web1_CTY-hot-10776.jpg", "creator": "@ecotraveler"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/12/31/hawaii-news/newswatch/more-than-270-record-high-temperatures-ties-recorded-in-hawaii-in-2019/"}
