Prepare public kitchens, healthcare posts, medicines, sleeping mats, public toilets and other basic needs for evacuees,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nThe flash floods have disrupted public transportation systems in the city. At least 10 flights at Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in East Jakarta were reportedly canceled.
