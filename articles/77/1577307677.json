It is not clear what form that Russian assistance has taken. U.S. prosecutors found a Russian effort in 2016 to use social media to boost Sanders\u2019s campaign against Hillary Clinton, part of a broader effort to hurt Clinton, sow dissension in the American electorate and ultimately help elect Donald Trump.\n\nSanders responded to the brief, sharing he was not interested in accepting Russian help.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, frankly, who [Russian President Vladimir] Putin wants to be president,\u201d Sanders said per the report.\n\nHe also instructed Russian entities, including Russian President Vladimir Putin to \u201cstay out of American elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy message to Putin is clear: Stay out of American elections, and as president, I will make sure that you do,\u201d he continued.\n\nSanders also added: \u201cIn 2016, Russia used Internet propaganda to sow division in our country, and my understanding is that they are doing it again in 2020. Some of the ugly stuff on the Internet attributed to our campaign may well not be coming from real supporters.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic candidate also shared that he was first notified of the interference more than a month ago, prompting reporters to question why he did not share the news himself.\n\n\u201cBecause I go to many intelligence briefings which I don\u2019t reveal to the public,\u201d he said in response.\n\n\u201cWell, it was not clear what role they\u2019re going to play,\u201d he added. \u201cWe were told that Russia, maybe other countries, are going to get involved in this campaign. And look, here\u2019s the message, to Russia \u2014 stay out of American elections.\u201d\n\nWhat a coincidence that Russia always happens to support whoever the Democrat party elites are trying to destroy at any given point in time. The seditious morons behind these idiotic leaks aren\u2019t even trying anymore. It\u2019s embarrassing. https://t.co/eIesv5ThEW \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) February 21, 2020\n\nAccording to the Washington Post report, news of Russia supporting Sanders\u2019 candidacy came just days after intelligence officials briefing lawmakers in Washington that Russian entities were already interfering to support President Trump.\n\nThe report adds:\n\nIn that closed hearing for the House Intelligence Committee, lawmakers were also told that Sanders had been informed about Russia\u2019s interference. The prospect of two rival campaigns both receiving help from Moscow appears to reflect what intelligence officials have previously described as Russia\u2019s broader interest in sowing division in the United States and uncertainty about the validity of American elections.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Feb 22 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.sarahpalinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "U.S. Intel Community: Russia Is Helping Bernie Sanders' Campaign", "description": "Russia is playing an active role in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary process, according to a new report from the United States intelligence community.
