Cybersecurity adversaries become more sophisticated and more organized day by day, and we really need to understand privacy on a continuum of data security. We need to take a more proactive approach to cybersecurity and make sure that we are continuing to protect consumers.\u201d\n\nSome reports have estimated that more than 1,200 data breaches exposed over 446.5 million records in the United States in 2018. Worldwide, data breaches compromised more than 4.5 billion data records in the first half of 2018 alone. And this year, the largest ever single public data breach by volume was discovered \u2013 it exposed more than 772 million unique emails and more than 21 million unique passwords.\n\nIn light of these ever-increasing cyber threats, transparency, consent and plain-language notices are simply not enough, Cantwell said in her remarks, while pushing for a greater focus on protection of people\u2019s personal data.\n\n\u201cWhile the benefits of the online world are everywhere\u2026so must be protections of personal information that is more than just a commodity. We need to make sure that the culture of monetizing our personal data at every twist and turn is countered with the protection of people\u2019s personal data.\u201d\n\nAt the first Commerce Committee hearing on privacy in the 116th Congress, Cantwell criticized efforts to pre-empt laws from states like California, which has adopted its own privacy protections, in any federal legislation that Congress may consider.\n\nSenator Cantwell has long advocated for more stringent protections for the privacy of American consumers, including when she questioned the CEO of Equifax on data breaches, when she questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and when she urged President Trump to veto a resolution passed by Congress to undo consumer privacy regulations adopted by the FCC.\n\nHere is VIDEO and AUDIO from Senator Cantwell\u2019s opening statement at today\u2019s hearing.\n\nHere is VIDEO and AUDIO from Senator Cantwell\u2019s Q&A with the witnesses at the hearing.\n\n###", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/themes/cantwell/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "date": "2019-05-01", "title": "Cantwell Continues to Fight the Rising Tide of Privacy Threats Impacting Consumers", "og": {"image": "https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/themes/cantwell/images/sharelogo.jpg", "title": "Cantwell Continues to Fight the Rising Tide of Privacy Threats Impacting Consumers | U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington", "description": "The Official U.S. Senate website of Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington"}}, "canonical_link": ""}
