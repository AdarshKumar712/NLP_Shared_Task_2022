I think he's a man of his word, so we're going to find out.\"\n\nIn announcing that his moratorium on nuclear testing is no longer operative, Kim also told a meeting of ruling party officials in North Korea he would unveil a \"new strategic weapon\" in the near future, the state news agency said. Kim had given the United States an end-of-the-year deadline to reduce economic sanctions on his country or face the prospect of new nuclear tests.\n\n\"The DPRK will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy,\" the Korean Central News Agency reported Kim as saying.\n\nTrump administration officials had feared such a test during the holiday \u2013 a North Korea official had threatened a \"Christmas gift\" to the U.S. \u2013 but nothing had happened as midnight passed in North Korea.\n\nIn speaking with reporters, Trump joked that he hoped Kim's \"Christmas present\" was \"a beautiful vase ... as opposed to something else.\"\n\nTrump remains hopeful of a denuclearization agreement with North Korea, though critics say Kim's government has continued to develop nuclear programs even after the two leaders signed a document at their first summit in June of 2018. The two men also met in 2019 in Vietnam and at the North Korea-South Korea border.\n\nWhile Trump often cites the Singapore agreement as a hopeful sign, critics pointed out that it was nonspecific and nonbinding when it came to North Korea giving up nuclear weapons.\n\n\"Kim signed nothing binding regarding nukes or missiles. No Kim ever has,\" tweeted Robert E. Kelly, professor of political science at Pusan National University in South Korea.\n\nHe added: \"And Republicans used to know that the Kims shouldn\u2019t be trusted. But now the GOP\u2019s a cult of personality, right? So if the great leader says it\u2019s true, it must be so.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The end-of-the-year holidays passed Wednesday without a new nuclear test in North Korea, but with the threat of one from Kim Jong Un.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Donald Trump downplays renewed nuclear threats from North Korea's Kim Jong Un", "description": "The end-of-the-year holidays passed Wednesday without a new nuclear test in North Korea, but with the threat of one from Kim Jong Un.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/01/donald-trump-downplays-nuclear-threats-north-koreas-kim-jong-un/2790175001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/01/01/USAT/8681e95d-b982-45ed-a248-93ea3e96ef7b-AP_North_Korea_Ending_the_War.JPG?crop=2622,1475,x0,y146&width=2622&height=1475&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 2622, "height": 1475}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "David Jackson", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The end-of-the-year holidays passed Wednesday without a new nuclear test in North Korea, but with the threat of one from Kim Jong Un.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/01/01/USAT/8681e95d-b982-45ed-a248-93ea3e96ef7b-AP_North_Korea_Ending_the_War.JPG?crop=2622,1475,x0,y146&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Donald Trump downplays renewed nuclear threats from North Korea's Kim Jong Un", "description": "The end-of-the-year holidays passed Wednesday without a new nuclear test in North Korea, but with the threat of one from Kim Jong Un."}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/01/donald-trump-downplays-nuclear-threats-north-koreas-kim-jong-un/2790175001/"}
