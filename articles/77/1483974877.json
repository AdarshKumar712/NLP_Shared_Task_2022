Just 39% realise that we depend on nature and biodiversity for key elements of life, such as food, water and clean air.\n\nWWF is calling on the public to stand up for the planet and is asking global leaders to address our nature emergency by working together to develop a global plan of action, a New Deal for Nature and People.\n\nDespite the lack of widespread awareness of the crisis our planet is facing, the survey showed a majority of respondents (70%) across the 10 countries feel personally responsible for protecting nature and biodiversity. 65% say commitment from their governments to protect it is insufficient. The importance of protecting biodiversity for future generations is also considered as crucial to the majority (80%), while climate change, deforestation, and river and ocean pollution are seen as biodiversity\u2019s biggest threats.\n\nThe figures highlight the importance of the global conversation that is being sparked by the ground breaking Our Planet Netflix series, created in collaboration with WWF and produced by Silverback Films, and aiming to reach millions of people to create a pivotal moment for nature. Thousands of people all over the world are adding their voices and calling for action via an online spinning globe demonstrating the scale of the movement worldwide. Go to www.ourplanet.com/voice/.\n\nWWF Ambassador and naturalist Sir David Attenborough who narrates the series said: \u201cToday we have become the greatest threat to the health of our home but there\u2019s still time for us to address the challenges we\u2019ve created, if we act now. If people can truly understand what is at stake, I believe they will expect business and governments to get on with the practical solutions.\n\nAnd as a species we are expert problem-solvers. But we haven\u2019t yet applied ourselves to this problem with the focus it requires. We can create a world with clean air and water, unlimited energy, and fish stocks that will sustain us well into the future.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Our Planet project launches at a critical time when our nature and wildlife is under threat like never before. Recent figures[2] from WWF\u2019s Living Planet Report 2018 show that global populations of vertebrate species have, on average, declined by 60 per cent since 1970 \u2013 less than a lifetime.\n\nColin Butfield, Executive Director of WWF-UK and Conservation Advisor for Our Planet, said: \u201c We\u2019re the first generation to know the full impact of what we\u2019re doing to our planet, and the last that has the chance to do anything about it. If people around the world speak out and say our planet is worth protecting, our leaders will have no choice but to listen. We hope Our Planet will spark one of the most important conversations of our time - about the one home we all share.\u201d\n\nThrough the series and WWF Our Planet initiatives, the charity is taking the opportunity to raise awareness, educate, and shift attitudes towards conservation. An array of free online resources at OurPlanet.com have been created to help people of all ages understand the importance of Earth\u2019s habitats and how they can help safeguard them for people and wildlife for generations to come. The website is focused around the eight biomes introduced in the series and enables visitors to take a deep dive into the most pressing challenges and solutions facing our natural world.\n\nOurPlanet.com will also provide a wealth of educational resources for schools, youth groups and families to engage young people in the global conversation around the series. These include downloadable classroom materials and guides for educators, an \u2018Our Planet Live\u2019 platform offering live link-ups with experts for classrooms all around the world, and a ground-breaking free nature ID app called Seek, developed for Our Planet by iNaturalist, which helps budding naturalists to gain a better understanding of their local environment and global biodiversity.\n\nVisit OurPlanet.com to view the \u2018How Biodiversity Works\u2019 film to find out more about why it\u2019s so important to our planet.\n\nGo to OurPlanet.com to go behind-the-scenes of the Our Planet Netflix series and find out how you can help our planet to thrive again by adding your voice calling for urgent action, make a pledge, and be part of an interactive journey exploring our astonishing planet through an explorable globe.\n\nFollow Our Planet on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook and be part of the conversation with #ShareOurPlanet:\n\n\u25cf Our Planet Instagram: www.instagram.com/ourplanet\n\n\u25cf Our Planet Facebook: www.facebook.com/ourplanet\n\n\u25cf Our Planet Twitter: www.twitter.com/ourplanet\n\n- Ends -\n\nNotes to Editors:\n\n1 The Living Planet Report 2018, Nov 2018\n\n2 Online survey on biodiversity across 10 countries, 18+ year olds, fieldwork conducted 3 - 13th Mar 18. 10,328 respondents. Countries include: China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Brazil, Columbia, Peru, Mexico, South Africa and Kenya.\n\nAbout the New Deal for Nature and People:\n\nIn 2020 we have the chance to put the world on the path to a better future, due to a historic coming together of key international decisions on environment, climate and sustainable development that have the potential to put our planet at the heart of our economic, political and financial systems. This is an unmissable, one-off opportunity for world leaders to take action for our planet and to move us towards a better future that benefits everyone. A New Deal for Nature and People is urgently needed with the aim of reversing the trend of nature loss by 2030 and restoring nature.\n\nAbout the Netflix Our Planet series\n\nThe series launches on 5 April 2019, showcasing the extraordinary place we all call home. From the creator of Planet Earth, Silverback Films and in collaboration with WWF, the eight-part series features never-before-seen footage of wildlife and their habitats while also revealing why the natural world matters to us all and what steps must be taken to preserve it.\n\nThe ambitious four-year Our Planet project has been filmed in 50 countries across all the continents of the world, with over 600 members of crew capturing more than three and a half thousand filming days, and will focus on the breadth of the diversity of habitats around the world, from the remote Arctic wilderness and mysterious deep oceans to the vast landscapes of Africa and diverse jungles of South America.\n\nIn the first episode, \u201cOne Planet,\u201d viewers will travel from the Brazilian rainforest to Norway\u2019s Svalbard archipelago, discovering how each fragile habitat is connected and why they are all essential for life to thrive on this planet. Subsequent episodes capture Earth\u2019s key biomes, or habitats: the icy frozen worlds, jungles, coastal seas, deserts and grasslands, high seas, freshwater regions and forests.\n\nThanks to an extensive team that includes some of the world\u2019s best wildlife cinematographers, researchers and scientists \u2014 and the latest in 4K camera technology \u2014 each episode features several stunning sequences that have never been filmed before.\n\nUnprecedented in scope and ambition, Our Planet will entertain and captivate a global audience of all ages.
