Even if you can\u2019t see the danger you could be spreading it,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Maxwell recommends people follow the simple Check-Clean-Dry process before leaving any waterway:\n\n\u2022 Check all gear that touched water and leave behind any weed or debris.\n\n\u2022 Clean gear with a simple solution of 5% dishwashing liquid (one tablespoon per 250mls of water). The solution can be tipped into anchor wells, bilge areas, kayak hulls and sprayed onto wet surfaces and fishing gear. Absorbent materials, such as lifejackets, wetsuits, booties and tramping boots can be soaked for several minutes\n\n\u2022 Dry gear inside and out for at least 24 hours before visiting another waterway.\n\n\u201cFollowing these simple procedures will help stop freshwater pests from spreading throughout New Zealand\u2019s waterways. If we all do our bit, we\u2019ll protect our waterways for future generations,\u201d said Ms Maxwell.\n\nFor more information about didymo and other freshwater pests visit www.mpi.govt.nz/check-clean-dry .\n\nTo report suspected Didymo or other pests, phone the hotline immediately on 0800 80 99 66.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Scoop Media\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Gisborne District Council", "Regional", "Environment and Conservation", "Local Government", "Scoop"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Find More", "New Zealand National Party", "New Zealand Government", "Vaping Trade Association ...", "Sporting Hunters Outd...", "Social Credit", "Department Of The Prime Minister", "New Zealand Taxpayers' Union", "Hapai Te Hauora", "New Zealand Police"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Gisborne District Council and Biosecurity New Zealand are reminding everyone who visits rivers, lakes and streams this summer to check, clean and dry their gear when they move between waterways.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/images/favicons/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Don\u2019t spread invasive freshwater pests this summer", "keywords": "Gisborne District Council, Regional, Environment and Conservation, Local Government, Scoop", "description": "Gisborne District Council and Biosecurity New Zealand are reminding everyone who visits rivers, lakes and streams this summer to check, clean and dry their gear when they move between waterways.", "verify-v1": "DmDRtGvVBvw+iZevBiahLdYqjyp7GyLA1poTPET2uBg=", "y_key": "4091684479be8a25", "msvalidate.01": "D3EE7BEC171B22CC0004BCAD3AA9F55A", "google-site-verification": "_g7_as_6L5G11kGq92K0w9zHzfUnAYXOUVCvYtF0evQ", "section_key": "nzpolitics", "fb": {"admins": 100007318459475}, "og": {"image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": ""}
