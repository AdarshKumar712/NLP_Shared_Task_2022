But will it be better or worse for us and the planet?\n\nIn 2004, the Guardian correctly predicted that the developed world\u2019s overreliance on meat would be one of the most pressing issues for the survival of our species. \u201cBritons need to say goodbye to burgers and meat,\u201d we wrote, \u201cbecause the overemphasis on meat in the western diet is one of the things that stifles sustainable food production.\u201d\n\nThankfully, the past decade and a half has seen an unprecedented interest in meat-free diets. In 2004, veganism was seen as a fussy, faddish lifestyle choice. Now, buoyed by blockbuster documentaries such as Cowspiracy and What the Health, and celebrities such as Ellie Goulding and Ariana Grande, it has never been so popular. According to the Vegan Society, 600,000 Britons are vegan. In 2006, this figure was just 150,000.\n\nDemand for vegan food is at unprecedented levels: in 2018, the UK launched more vegan products than any other nation; in 2019, 250,000 people signed up for the Veganuary challenge, pledging to avoid all meat and dairy for the month of January. For those not willing to make the jump to full veganism, one in three Britons had at least reduced their meat consumption in 2018.\n\nBut there is still a long way to go. The west\u2019s overconsumption of meat and dairy continues to fuel global warming. Livestock is responsible for approximately 14.5% of greenhouse gas emissions; 70% of global deforestation takes place in order to grow animal feed. In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet and Health determined that substantial dietary shifts must take place by 2050. \u201cGlobal consumption of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes will have to double, and consumption of foods such as red meat and sugar will have to be reduced by more than 50%,\u201d the panel of experts judged.\n\nBy 2050, meat-eating could seem like a throwback, according to some experts. \u201cOur current method of growing crops to feed to animals so we can eat animals is shockingly inefficient,\u201d says Bruce Friedrich of the Good Food Institute, which works to develop alternatives to meat. \u201cBy 2050, [almost] all meat will be plant-based, or cultivated.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018There won\u2019t be factory farms or abattoirs in 2050\u2019: beef cattle in Argentina, a major cow-meat producer. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nPlant-based \u201cmeat\u201d is already here. The Beyond Burger and the Impossible Burger are widely available, but Friedrich predicts a widening of the products on offer to consumers. \u201cWe\u2019ll have plant-based meat that doesn\u2019t exist yet, whether it\u2019s pork chops, steaks, tuna or salmon.\u201d Anna Taylor, the executive director of the Food Foundation, thinks that plant-based substitutes will find their way into processed foods, without consumers being any the wiser. \u201cPlant-based alternatives to animal protein will appear automatically in foods we eat, without consumers having to change their habits.\u201d\n\nThe real challenge will be persuading consumers to embrace cultivated meat. Also known as lab-grown meat, this is developed from animal or fish cells in the nutrient bath of a \u201cbioreactor\u201d. It is not yet on the market, but at least 40 private companies are working on cultivated-meat alternatives. In the UK, scientists at the University of Bath are growing bacon on blades of grass. The California startup JUST has created chicken nuggets in a bioreactor.\n\nFriedrich is optimistic that we will all be eating cultivated meat by 2050. \u201cThere won\u2019t be factory farms or abattoirs in 2050,\u201d he predicts. \u201cPeople will look back at the idea of growing live animals for meat in the same way that we look back at horse-drawn carriages for getting from London to Brussels.\u201d But we won\u2019t entirely stop eating meat from animals reared for slaughter. \u201cThere will be some heritage breed farms and slaughterhouses where the animals are treated well,\u201d Friedrich concedes. But it will be a limited market.\n\nGrowing live animals for meat will seem as archaic as taking a horse-drawn carriage from London to Brussels\n\nIf this all sounds like science fiction, strap yourselves in for the predictions of the food designer and futurist Chlo\u00e9 Rutzerveld. \u201cWe\u2019ll skip all of our current existing foods and switch towards a whole new eating system where we build food with microorganisms,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead of growing crops or raising animals, we\u2019ll use microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, yeast and microalgae to directly produce the carbs, proteins and fats we need.\u201d This food will again be produced in bioreactors, before being filtered and dried into powders.\n\nBut we won\u2019t be consigned to a joyless diet of flavourless dust. Rutzerveld claims that 3D-printing technology will be able to replicate the textures and flavours of regular food. \u201cWe can make a library of mouth feels and texture at a nanoscale,\u201d she says, \u201cin order to recreate sensations like freshness or juiciness.\u201d Eating microorganisms grown in bioreactors will be transformative. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to make the food-production system so much more efficient, saving the land and water and energy resources.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A burger made with a scrambled-egg imitation made from mung beans by the plant-based food startup JUST. Photograph: Just Inc/Reuters\n\nNot everyone agrees. \u201cLab-grown meats are a red herring,\u201d says Prof Pete Smith of the University of Aberdeen. \u201cWe don\u2019t need them. We can get most of the protein we need from plant-based foods.\u201d He is also doubtful that we will move to other protein sources such as insects. \u201cWealthy countries are already massively overconsuming protein,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to move to alternate protein sources \u2013 if we cut in half the amount of protein we are already eating, we would be at healthier levels.\u201d\n\nBut even if we are not eating insects directly, they can still be of use in our wider food chain. \u201cInsects could be really important for feeding animals,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cOne of the problems we have is that ruminant animals (including cattle, sheep and goats) are often fed on soya, which is grown in deforested parts of the planet. If we could shift to other ways of feeding animals, such as insects, we can reduce deforestation.\u201d\n\nConsumers will continue to turn to plant-based alternatives to dairy. Plant-based milks are already big business, and egg substitutes will be next: JUST and Zero Egg have already developed egg substitutes, and we can expect other brands to emerge.\n\nBy 2050, climate change will dramatically affect what we can eat and drink. Speciality crops such as avocados, coffee and wine grapes \u2013 which can only be grown in a very narrow climate range \u2013 will be at risk. \u201cA one- or two-degree change in climate could mean make-or-break for some regions growing speciality crops,\u201d says Prof Gregory V Jones, an expert in wine growing at Linfield College\u2019s department of environmental studies. \u201cWine-growing regions such as Greece, southern Italy, southern Spain and Portugal will all potentially experience issues,\u201d he continues. In turn, though, wine-growing will become possible in places such as Scandinavia and the north of England. \u201cThey aren\u2019t world-class producing regions now, but by 2050, if climate change continues, they could be.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bananas will no longer be a cheap household staple. Photograph: Alamy\n\nIf real progress isn\u2019t made to halt global heating, food production in the global south will be imperilled. \u201cThings aren\u2019t looking good for the developing world,\u201d says Smith. \u201cChina has a big problem with water \u2013 overextraction means that the soil is becoming too salty. India also has a problem with unsustainable groundwater use.\u201d Rice-growing in China and wheat-growing in the northern plains of India could be affected. All of this augurs badly, given that China and India\u2019s population is forecast to rise to a combined 3.2 billion by 2050. \u201cWater stress will become more acute,\u201d Smith warns. \u201cThe more the climate warms, the more droughts we will have. This will take place in areas that are already struggling to feed themselves.\u201d\n\nIn the UK, much imported produce may become prohibitively expensive. \u201cWe are very reliant on countries that are vulnerable to climate change and water scarcity,\u201d says Taylor. The grapes and berries we now import from Morocco, Spain, India and South Africa will become scarce. We will have to return to more seasonal patterns of eating \u2013 bananas, for example, will no longer be a cheap household staple.\n\nWidening inequality will play out on dinner tables across the world. \u201cI\u2019m worried about uneven dietary development,\u201d says Prof Corinna Hawkes of the Centre for Food Policy at City, University of London. \u201cThe diets of rich people will get better, and those of poorer people will get worse, and we\u2019ll end up with appalling inequalities in what we\u2019re eating.\u201d She predicts that wealthy people will continue to reduce their meat and processed-food intake, and embrace indigenous food such as sorghum and amaranth. \u201cThese foods were once eaten by poor people, but will become resurgent in higher-income groups, as they become more interested in novel foods.\u201d\n\nAs fast-food companies continue to make inroads into developing nations, junk-food consumption will rise in historically impoverished communities. \u201cThese people have inadequate diets already,\u201d says Hawkes, \u201cand they will be adding junk food into their diet, which only contributes to the problem of obesity.\u201d\n\nRich people's diets will get better, and poorer people's will get worse \u2013 we\u2019ll have appalling inequalities\n\nRising obesity rates are a real cause for concern; half of Britain\u2019s population is predicted to be obese before 2050. Globally, 60% of men and 50% of women will be obese by 2050, if current trends continue. \u201cWe need to put into place policies that level the playing field and reduce the abilities of the companies selling junk food to make it so affordable and accessible,\u201d says Hawkes. \u201cJunk food needs to be taken out of the spotlight and nutritious food put centre-stage.\u201d\n\nSo, what should we be eating in 2050? It\u2019s fairly simple \u2013 what we should be eating now. (And what the Guardian predicted in 2004.) \u201cWe need to be eating more fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, less junk food, and less meat and dairy,\u201d advises Taylor. \u201cIf we do these four things, we stand a chance of reversing some of the diet-related diseases that are currently crippling the NHS, and also bringing down the carbon and biodiversity impacts of our diet.\u201d But whether we\u2019ll be able to resist the siren pull of processed food and cheap meat remains to be seen.\n\nThe plate of 2050\n\nWhole grains: 232g a day, 811 calories\n\nTubers or starchy vegetables (ie potatoes, cassava): 50g a day, 39 calories\n\nVegetables: 300g a day, 78 calories\n\nFruits: 200g a day, 126 calories\n\nDairy foods (whole milk or equivalents): 250g a day, 153 calories\n\nCombined protein sources (to include beef, lamb, pork, chicken, eggs, or fish): 84g a day, 151 calories\n\nOther protein sources (to include legumes or nuts): 125g a day, 575 calories\n\nFats from oil: 51.8g, 450 calories\n\nAdded sugars: 31g a day, 120 calories\n\nSource: the EAT-Lancet Commission", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Food", "Veganism", "Life and style", "Farming", "Climate change", "Health & wellbeing", "Environment", "Ethical and green living"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Sirin Kale"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "One way or another, our diet is going to be transformed.
