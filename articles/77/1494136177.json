In a shrinking overall market, the brand therefore significantly expanded its market share. Volume growth was achieved in Europe, South America, Asia-Pacific and the USA. Compared with the previous year, customers\u2019 interest in electrified models grew considerably. More than 80,000 electric vehicles were delivered, corresponding to a marked increase of about 60 percent.\n\nChief Operating Officer Ralf Brandst\u00e4tter said: \u201c2019 was an important year for the Volkswagen brand. With the ID.3 and Golf 8, we have successfully presented groundbreaking new products and consistently focused on earnings power. The digital transformation roadmap which we have agreed with the employee representatives and is now to be implemented will also make a key contribution to improving efficiency and safeguarding the future. We will continue to work on costs in a disciplined way so that we can make the necessary investments for the future. Thanks to fantastic team performance, we have exceeded the high delivery level of 2018 despite a difficult market environment.\u201c\n\nSales Board Member J\u00fcrgen Stackmann added: \u201cIn 2019, we significantly strengthened our global market position with considerable gains in market shares. This is a clear sign of the strength of our brand, the competitiveness of our products and services and the performance of our sales organization. I would like to thank our customers, as well as our retail partners and their teams, for their trust, loyalty and passionate commitment.\u201d\n\nThe Volkswagen brand forged ahead with electrification in the year which has come to an end. Compared with the previous year, the number of electric vehicles delivered grew by about 60 percent to more than 80,000 units. More than half of these customers opted for an all-electric vehicle and the remainder chose a plug-in hybrid. Once again, the most popular model was the e-Golf2, with more than 35,000 units delivered.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/content/dam/online-kommunikation/brands/corporate/world/presence/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@publisher_handle", "title": "Volkswagen Passenger Cars brings 2019 to a successful close", "description": "In 2019, the Volkswagen brand delivered 6,278,300 vehicles throughout the world, exceeding the prior-year figure by 0.5 percent...", "image": "https://www.volkswagenag.com/presence/investorrelation/images/press_releases/02_volkswagen_brand/2020/2020_01_VWBrand_Teaser_en.jpg"}, "og": {"title": "Volkswagen Passenger Cars brings 2019 to a successful close", "type": "website", "image": "https://www.volkswagenag.com/presence/investorrelation/images/press_releases/02_volkswagen_brand/2020/2020_01_VWBrand_Teaser_en.jpg", "description": "In 2019, the Volkswagen brand delivered 6,278,300 vehicles throughout the world, exceeding the prior-year figure by 0.5 percent..."}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "canonical_link": ""}
