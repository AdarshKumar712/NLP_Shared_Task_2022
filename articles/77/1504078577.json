The Joe Rogan Experience covers an eclectic range of topics, from sports to science to politics, and has millions of dedicated followers on YouTube alone. Rogan has described himself as \u201cleft on everything\u201d politically, and said on Tuesday that he would likely vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of endorsement that strengthens Sanders\u2019s electability argument: that he can reach out to audiences beyond progressive activists.\n\nBut when the Sanders campaign made a short video trumpeting Rogan\u2019s announcement on Thursday, it immediately kicked off a controversy over whether the campaign should have trumpeted the endorsement so publicly. Rogan, despite his claims to be left-wing, also has a very long history of offensive commentary, especially about trans people. He\u2019s had friendly interviews with right-wing extremists like Milo Yiannopoulos, Candace Owens, and Alex Jones \u2014 and even voiced some support for 9/11 conspiracy theories.\n\nThe progressive world immediately split into competing camps. Some are arguing that Sanders was right to trumpet Rogan\u2019s support because beating Donald Trump will require alliances with people who you disagree with on some issues. Others argue that Rogan\u2019s views on transgender people \u2014 in a 2013 show, he referred to a trans woman as \u201ca fucking man,\u201d saying, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t have a dick anymore\u201d \u2014 should place him beyond the pale, just as an endorsement from a prominent racist would.\n\nThis Twitter exchange between two prominent left-leaning Washington, DC, journalists \u2014 the Justice Collaborative\u2019s Chris Geidner, a longtime reporter on law and LGBT issues; and the Intercept\u2019s Ryan Grim, who covers Democratic Party politics \u2014 cuts to the core of the disagreement:\n\nEveryone on the left has correctly expended so much energy over the past years condemning Trump for his association with and support from white supremacists, but when it\u2019s Sanders and an anti-trans, anti-gay bigot it\u2019s \u201che\u2019s a part of our politics, what can we do?\u201d What bullshit. https://t.co/kpa3t4YxAa \u2014 Chris Geidner (@chrisgeidner) January 24, 2020\n\nThis is one of the most revealing spats in the 2020 primary so far. It touches on a core moral question about politics: What views should render someone unacceptable in polite discourse? It\u2019s also a dispute about how to win in 2020. Should Democrats water down some of their commitments to win over potential Trump voters and, if so, which views?\n\nAnd it\u2019s also yet another piece of ammunition in the war over Sanders among progressives, a sign that the 2016-era fight over how much he can be trusted on issues other than economic inequality still hasn\u2019t been settled.\n\nWhy you should care about Joe Rogan\u2019s endorsement\n\nFor about 10 years, Rogan has been the host of The Joe Rogan Experience, an internet talk show that\u2019s become astonishingly popular both in podcast and video form on YouTube. It\u2019s been the No. 1 or 2 show in the world on Apple Podcasts for the past few years; its YouTube channel, PowerfulJRE, has over 7 million subscribers.\n\nIt\u2019s given a new relevancy to the 52-year-old media veteran. He started his career as a standup comedian, starred in the \u201990s sitcom NewsRadio, and then worked as the host of the gross-out reality show Fear Factor from 2001 to 2006. He\u2019s also a passionate mixed martial arts fan who has worked as an announcer at MMA fights.\n\nRogan\u2019s show is a meandering interview series with a very strange panel of guests that reflect the host\u2019s personal interests, ranging from MMA fighters to comedians to evolutionary biologists to Dr. Phil. His most famous episode is a 2018 interview with tech mogul Elon Musk, in which Musk smoked a blunt with Rogan and floated a proposal to sell his company stock at $420 (get it?). The interview kicked off a panic in the business world about Musk\u2019s mental competency.\n\nRogan is an engaging host, one who lets conversations float freely on a range of diverse and often quite interesting topics. When you watch some of Rogan\u2019s more thoughtful interviews, it\u2019s easy to understand why he has such a big cult following.\n\nBut the show\u2019s treatment of politics, a common topic in the interviews, is something else entirely. While Rogan claims to be left-wing, the show\u2019s principal political enemy appears to be liberal identity politics. He\u2019s a leading light of the \u201cIntellectual Dark Web,\u201d the loose confederation of anti-PC thinkers including Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson and right-wing gadfly Ben Shapiro. In fact, the question that led to his Sanders endorsement came from one of the IDW\u2019s chief popularizers, New York Times columnist Bari Weiss.\n\nRogan\u2019s contempt for political correctness comes through throughout the show. In a 2013 episode, for example, he \u201cjoked\u201d that seeing a screening of Planet of the Apes in a mostly black neighborhood was \u201cwalk[ing] in to Planet of the Apes.\u201d He described the experience of finding out that his comedy hero Richard Pryor had sex with men as \u201ca spike to the heart.\u201d\n\nHe has a particular distaste for the trans rights movement. In a 2017 JRE episode with Shapiro, he describes his radicalization on the issue as stemming from anger at Fallon Fox, a trans woman who competed in women\u2019s MMA fights:\n\nI didn\u2019t have a dog in this fight. I was completely open and liberal about it \u2014 until there was a case where a man who had been a man for 30 years became a woman for a little less than two years and then started MMA fighting women. Beating the fuck out of these women, and then not proclaiming that he or she used to be a man ... if you ever watch the fights, she wasn\u2019t winning because she was skillful. She was fucking manhandling these women, it was ugly.\n\nThis very short paragraph contains all the classic tropes of transphobia: a denial of the authenticity of trans people\u2019s identity, an insinuation that they\u2019re a threat to cis folks, and a claim that they\u2019re using their gender identity to somehow get ahead in life. It is, to quote Rogan, ugly, and one of many such examples when it comes to trans issues.\n\nTrying to understand the nature of The Joe Rogan Experience, what connections there are between its often-offensive content and immense popularity, is a kind of tricky question. One plausible conclusion, exemplified by this piece by Slate\u2019s Justin Phillips, is that they\u2019re deeply intertwined \u2014 that the show succeeds because it\u2019s a kind of dangerous faux-intellectualism for shallow bigots:\n\nBy routinely disparaging the credibility and intentions of traditional centers of learning while giving idiots hours on end to profess their theories, Rogan allows his guests to establish themselves as the real fonts of mind-expanding knowledge. Many of his listeners are buying in. \u2018My generation has hit the jackpot with this new way of learning. If you don\u2019t watch or trust television and school feels like it has failed you, there is still hope to claim back your humanity, this show is the answer. \u2026 You\u2019re welcome,\u2019 wrote one podcast reviewer at the iTunes Store. Another: \u2018Great Show please have Richard Spencer on.\u2019\n\nA second and opposing view, embodied in an Atlantic feature by Devin Gordon, is to understand Rogan as a way to reach a unique and underserved audience of men. \u201cMost of Rogan\u2019s critics don\u2019t really grasp the breadth and depth of the community he has built, and they act as though trying is pointless,\u201d he writes:\n\nThe bedrock issue, though, is Rogan\u2019s courting of a middle-bro audience that the cultural elite hold in particular contempt\u2014guys who get barbed-wire tattoos and fill their fridge with Monster energy drinks and preordered their tickets to see Hobbs & Shaw. Joe loves these guys, and his affection has none of the condescension and ironic distance many people fall back on in order to get comfortable with them. He shares their passions and enthusiasms at a moment when the public dialogue has branded them childish or problematic or a slippery slope to Trumpism. Like many of these men, Joe grumbles a lot about \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d He knows that he is privileged by virtue of his gender and his skin color, but in his heart he is sick of being reminded about it. Like lots of other white men in America, he is grappling with a growing sense that the term white man has become an epithet. And like lots of other men in America, not just the white ones, he\u2019s reckoning out loud with a fear that the word masculinity has become, by definition, toxic.\n\nIt is the gulf between these two ways of seeing of Rogan and the subculture he speaks to that defines the debate over how Sanders should have handled Rogan\u2019s endorsement.\n\nJoe Rogan, Bernie Sanders, and the big debates about 2020\n\nAfter Rogan said he\u2019d likely vote for Sanders on Tuesday\u2019s Joe Rogan Experience episode, Sanders\u2019s team released an edited version of Rogan\u2019s comments, tweeting them out on the senator\u2019s heavily followed personal account Thursday afternoon:\n\n\u201cI think I'll probably vote for Bernie... He\u2019s been insanely consistent his entire life. He\u2019s basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing his whole life. And that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from.\u201d -Joe Rogan pic.twitter.com/fuQP0KwGGI \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) January 23, 2020\n\nThe online backlash started more or less immediately on Twitter, with numerous high-profile users accusing the campaign of promoting a transphobe. Via email, Sanders campaign spokesperson Briahna Joy Gray argued that these criticisms were largely off-base.\n\n\u201cSharing a big tent requires including those who do not share every one of our beliefs, while always making clear that we will never compromise our values,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe truth is that by standing together in solidarity, we share the values of love and respect that will move us in the direction of a more humane, more equal world.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot implied in both the initial arguments against releasing the video and Gray\u2019s response. Broadly speaking, the issues under debate deal with three different issues: one moral, one tactical, and one about the identity of the Sanders campaign itself.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the moral dispute: whether someone with Rogan\u2019s views should be outside the realm of acceptable political discourse.\n\nOn the one hand, politics inevitably requires a degree of compromise and coalition-building. You simply can\u2019t win elections and pass laws without appealing to a broad group of people who disagree internally, and in a country like the United States that will likely include some people with social views progressives find odious.\n\nAt the same time, though, there has been an idea that some people\u2019s views are so odious that they can never be acceptable political partners. In 2008, for example, Nation of Islam leader and notorious anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan endorsed Barack Obama for president. Obama denounced Farrakhan\u2019s bigoted comments but faced criticism for not saying more explicitly that he rejected the endorsement itself. Virtually everyone called on Donald Trump to reject former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke\u2019s endorsement in 2016; the fact that he didn\u2019t really do it kicked off a major political firestorm.\n\nThe question, then, is where Joe Rogan falls on this spectrum. Is his history of offensive comments, especially about transgender people, so odious that the Sanders campaign shouldn\u2019t ethically promote him, or maybe even should denounce him? Or is it a case where trumpeting Rogan\u2019s support is worth it for the greater good of beating Trump?\n\nThe idea that Rogan\u2019s endorsement is helpful to the Sanders campaign also depends on a particular theory of victory: the idea that winning the White House requires appealing to both disaffected non-voters and working-class, non-college whites who populate the Rust Belt states. You hear this sort of argument a lot from the Sanders campaign and its media surrogates, particularly at the flagship socialist publication Jacobin. In this view, Rogan\u2019s audience is a uniquely persuadable subset of these people, which helps explain why Sanders actually appeared on Rogan\u2019s show last August.\n\nA competing vision, though, is that focusing on winning over these demographics \u2014 which include a healthy number of Trump supporters \u2014 is a huge mistake because they\u2019re animated primarily by their resentment of marginalized groups, and winning them over would require selling out the Democratic base: racial minorities and women and LGBTQ voters. Any gains, in this view, would be offset by depressed turnout in the base.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of room for nuance here. It can be true that, broadly speaking, the second view is correct, but also that the Sanders campaign rejecting the endorsement would still ultimately do more harm than good because Rogan\u2019s fans are obsessive, while most non-fans don\u2019t care all that much. It\u2019s possible the smartest move politically would have been to say nothing about Rogan\u2019s comments, letting it reach his hardcore fans without trumpeting it to a more mainstream audience (and kicking off a controversy).\n\nBut broadly speaking, the differences in big-picture strategic assessment help explain why Sanders and his allies are at odds with other people in the progressive camp.\n\nAnd this brings us to the last question: How much has Sanders learned from his last presidential run?\n\nThroughout the 2016 campaign, Sanders was dogged by accusations of disinterest in identity issues \u2014 of having a monomaniacal socialist focus on economic inequality and class that led him to sideline other vectors of oppression. The Sanders campaign has worked to address this concern in 2020, building a strong base of support in minority communities (particularly among young voters) and putting forward highly progressive plans on issues like criminal justice and immigration.\n\nBut the scars from 2016 aren\u2019t entirely healed over. Trumpeting Joe Rogan\u2019s support plays right into this axis of conflict. Rogan isn\u2019t particularly offensive to the left on class issues; his worst excesses all come on other identity-based concerns. Deciding to highlight his support so prominently will play to stereotypes, justified or not, about what Sanders really cares about.\n\nThe fight over Bernie Sanders and Joe Rogan is, in short, not really a fight about Joe Rogan. It\u2019s a fight over the direction and identity of the Democratic Party at a moment when Sanders is rocketing up in the polls \u2014 a debate over who he is, and whether he has the right values and judgment to lead the party.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Zack Beauchamp", "Andrew Prokop", "Cameron Peters", "Alissa Wilkinson", "Ian Millhiser", "Rebecca Jennings", "Rani Molla", "Jan"], "publish_date": "Fri Jan 24 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Joe Rogan\u2019s controversial endorsement of Bernie Sanders, explained.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/community_logos/52517/voxv.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vox", "published_time": "2020-01-24T16:10:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-24T16:10:00-05:00"}, "author": "Zack Beauchamp", "style-tools": "https://www.vox.com/style/community/441/4d365fb8c7edb584b73ae31bb1cba0b4/tools.css", "p": {"domain_verify": "d4410485bd6277c2bf2ce0f277819dc6"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "Joe Rogan\u2019s controversial endorsement of Bernie Sanders, explained.", "og": {"description": "Joe Rogan\u2019s controversial endorsement of Bernie Sanders, explained.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25MmXByFicrNQ3K_xAl9Vvu5ehM=/0x57:3000x1628/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19627011/869384308.jpg.jpg", "alt": "Comedian Joe Rogan onstage.", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Vox", "title": "Bernie Sanders\u2019s Joe Rogan experience", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/24/21080234/bernie-sanders-joe-rogan-experience-endorsement-controversy"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/24/21080234/bernie-sanders-joe-rogan-experience-endorsement-controversy", "title": "Bernie Sanders\u2019s Joe Rogan experience", "description": "Joe Rogan\u2019s controversial endorsement of Bernie Sanders, explained.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/22y2Tb4_xNrSOfXUvACF-fI0D-U=/0x92:3000x1592/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19627011/869384308.jpg.jpg", "alt": "Comedian Joe Rogan onstage."}, "site": "voxdotcom"}, "sailthru.title": "Bernie Sanders\u2019s Joe Rogan experience", "sailthru.tags": "general,vox,front-page,explainers,policy-and-politics,latest-news,category-explainers,category-news", "sailthru.description": "Joe Rogan\u2019s controversial endorsement of Bernie Sanders, explained.", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-24T16:10:00-05:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xmrgAfyHt_IFU7eNkec_lpXMY_4=/0x0:3000x1688/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66164151/869384308.jpg.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KOJp6WZ2pqq2jyhY5JQu4yyIO2A=/330x0:2730x2400/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66164151/869384308.jpg.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/hub/sbnu_logo_minimal/441/touch_icon_ipad_retina_1000_yellow.755.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#4f7177", "outbrainsection": "latest-news"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/24/21080234/bernie-sanders-joe-rogan-experience-endorsement-controversy"}
