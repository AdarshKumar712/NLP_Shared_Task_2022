When you move forward, everybody follows...But leaders are those who lead people in the right direction. Leaders are not those who lead people in inappropriate directions, as we are witnessing in a large number of university and college students, the way they are leading masses of crowds to carry out arson and violence in our cities and towns. This is not leadership\", General Rawat said at an event on 27 December, four days before ending his tenure as India\u2019s 27th army chief.\n\nOpposition politicians criticised him for that statement, with the Indian National Congress party saying that General Rawat\u2019s decision to speak against the CAA protests was both a violation of the Indian Constitution as well as Article 21 of the Army Act (\"no person subject to the Act shall publish in any form whatever or communicate directly or indirectly to the press any matter in relation to a political question'').\n\nThe Communist Party of India (Marxist) even sought an apology from General Rawat for his \u201cindiscretion\".\n\nIn a statement, the party said: \u201cThe Polit Bureau urges that the General apologises to the nation for his indiscretion which has extremely adverse ramifications for the Constitutional arrangement in the country. We also demand that the government takes note of such a breach and censures the General\".\n\nThe army and some others supporting General Rawat said he was well within his rights to speak as a citizen of the country.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, moving forward, General Rawat said: \u201cAll the three services will work as a team. As per the task given to the Chief of Defence Staff we have to enhance integration and do better resource management\".\n\nChief of Defence Staff(CDS) General Bipin Rawat: All the three services will work as a team.

He also paid tribute to the country's martyred soldiers.\n\nI am delighted that as we begin the new year and new decade, India gets its first Chief of Defence Staff in General Bipin Rawat.
