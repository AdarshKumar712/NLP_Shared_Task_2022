President Trump must have thought that this was not enough, so he also sent a letter to Kim,\u201d Moon said.\n\n\u201cI think this is a very positive development. It was a very good idea to stress the resolution for dialogue by sending the congratulatory message. Upon receiving the letter, North Korea also reiterated the close relationship between the two leaders and made it clear that it had not closed the door completely on dialogue, although it did attach a precondition that its demands must be met.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the time of the letter, the US was facing a lot of complex situations, including the conflict with Iran, and the fact Trump sent Kim a birthday message means that President Trump still regards North Korea as the most important issue on his diplomatic agenda.\u201d\n\nThe President repeated his stance on promoting active engagement with North Korea this year, which was contained in his New Year address delivered last week. In this regard, the South Korean leader mentioned the need to ease some of the UN sanctions imposed on the reclusive regime.\n\n\u201cI believe we can make efforts for exceptions from UN sanctions if necessary,\u201d Moon said. \u201cRather than looking just at US-North Korea talks, we should do as much as we can to expand inter-Korean cooperation. This will also be helpful in promoting US-North Korea dialogue.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned sports and tourism exchanges as well as starting cooperation at the inter-Korean border as some of the ways to expand inter-Korean cooperation within the boundaries of the sanctions.\n\nMoon called on the US to consider a different approach from its focus on sanctions. \u201cThe US needs to continuously seek new ideas, in close cooperation with South Korea, for a breakthrough in the US-North Korea talks,\u201d the President said.\n\nHe showed a negative response to criticism that his recent call for expediting engagement with North Korea was being snubbed by Pyongyang. \u201cIn inter-Korean diplomacy, there is much more than what is actually visible.\n\n\u201cInter-Korean relations are facing difficulties as they coincide with the stalemate in the North-US dialogue, but I am pushing forward with an optimistic view that efforts to work together through dialogue are continuing and can produce good results.\u201d\n\nKorea-US alliance\n\nConcerns have been rising about the health of Korea-US alliance due to complex bilateral issues, such as the defense cost-sharing negotiations and the U.S pressure on Korea to join its naval mission in the Strait of Hormuz. Moon sought to assuage these concerns by underlining that the Korea-US alliance remains \u201cstronger than ever with close communication and cooperation.\u201d\n\n\u201cClose communication and cooperation have led to the improvement of inter-Korean relations and resulted in US-North Korea dialogue,\u201d Moon added. \u201cLooking back at 2017 at the height of the crisis on the Korean Peninsula following Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile tests, I had three summits with President Trump and talked on the phone with him seven times. Through these, we came to a decision to postpone a joint Korea-US military exercise to pave the way for North Korea\u2019s participation in the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games. After this, inter-Korean dialogue began, which led to the talks between North Korea and the US\u201d\n\nCurrently, the biggest issue between Korea and the US is the Special Measures Agreement (SMA) negotiations to determine Korea\u2019s share of costs for maintaining US troops here and the possible dispatch of a Korean naval unit to the Strait of Hormuz to joining a US-led mission.\n\n\u201cRegarding the Hormuz question, there are complex factors to be considered. We need to think about our alliance with the US as well as our relations with Iran. We will take all of these into consideration as we look for a realistic solution.\u201d\n\nOn the defense costs, Moon stressed the need for an \u201cequitable share.\u201d \u201cThis is the only way it will be approved by the people and the National Assembly,\u201d he noted.\n\nhttps://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2020/01/356_281934.html\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory: Korea", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["korea"], "tags": ["view all day-by-day"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "South Korean leader hints at seeking exemption from US sanctions President Moon Jae-in said during a New Year press conference at Cheong Wa Dae, Tuesday, that he remains positive about the US-North Korea denuclearisation talks as the leaders of the two countries are still open for dialogu...", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"description": "15-Jan-2020 Informative articles concerning East Asia.
