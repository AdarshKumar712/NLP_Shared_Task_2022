one and two.\n\nHowever, the children\u2019s activity centres will now take in children of category three key workers.\n\nMore than 400 youngsters are already registered for the 29 activity centres set up around Fife to help key workers during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nThere was confusion among parents in Fife and Tayside over who was eligible to use the hubs being set up by local authorities.\n\nHowever, Carrie Lindsay, executive director of education and children\u2019s services in Fife Council, offered clarity on the kingdom\u2019s offering.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe opened our centres on Tuesday [last week], initially to the children of the most critical category one workers.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday that was opened up to some workers from category two and [this week] we will start to take children of category three workers.\n\n\u201cWe took this phased approach to make sure we had space for the most vital workers\u2019 children.\n\n\u201cOnce they were all registered, we reviewed our numbers to see how much space we had for category two workers\u2019 children. We are now in a position to open up to category three workers\u2019 children.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["fife council", "Courier Cruise", "coronavirus", "CORONAVIRUS", "children's activity centres"], "authors": ["Cheryl Peebles"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/12/cropped-icon_the-courier-32x32.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Coronavirus: Fife's childcare centres open to more key worker families during coronavirus lockdown - The Courier", "description": "Places at Fife\u2019s emergency childcare centres are being made available to more families this week.", "url": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/fife/1232449/fifes-childcare-centres-open-to-more-key-worker-families-during-coronavirus-lockdown/", "site_name": "The Courier", "image": {"identifier": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/04/stock_fife_council_hq-1024x683.jpg", "secure_url": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/04/stock_fife_council_hq-1024x683.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 683}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thecourieruk", "author": "www.facebook.com/thecourieruk", "tag": "fife council", "section": "Fife"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Places at Fife\u2019s emergency childcare centres are being made available to more families this week.", "title": "Coronavirus: Fife's childcare centres open to more key worker families during coronavirus lockdown - The Courier", "site": "@thecourieruk", "image": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/04/stock_fife_council_hq-1024x683.jpg", "creator": "@C_CPeebles"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "premium-content": "false", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/12/cropped-icon_the-courier-270x270.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/fife/1232449/fifes-childcare-centres-open-to-more-key-worker-families-during-coronavirus-lockdown/"}
