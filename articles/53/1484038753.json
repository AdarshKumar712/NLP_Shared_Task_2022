New York, Illinois, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Louisiana also saw large losses to other states.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s potential loss in reapportionment, which will be determined by next year\u2019s census count, would drop the state\u2019s number of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives from 53 to 52, said William Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got a lot to do with dispersion from California to the rest of the west,\u201d Frey said. \u201cArizona, Texas and Colorado are all big destinations for California migrants, and they all are gaining seats.\u201d\n\nA 2019 relocation study by Texas Realtors found that 63,175 Californians moved to Texas in 2017, while California was the top destination for Texans to move \u2014 nearly 41,000 relocated here.\n\nTexas is likely to gain three seats following the 2020 decennial count, according to Frey\u2019s analysis of census data, while states such as Arizona, Colorado and Oregon may gain one seat apiece.\n\nThe apportionment population count for each of the 50 states includes the state\u2019s total resident population \u2014 citizens and non-citizens \u2014 as well as a count of the overseas federal employees and their dependents who have that state listed as their home state in their employers\u2019 administrative records, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe House of Representatives is limited to 435 members, not under the U.S. Constitution, but because of a 1929 federal law that could be changed if lawmakers and the president agreed to do so.\n\nExactly where California would lose a seat in the House depends on which communities are larger or smaller compared to census numbers from 2010. The state\u2019s Citizens Redistricting Commission, whose members will be selected in coming months, will hold public hearings in 2021 to determine how to redraw congressional maps.\n\nPaul Mitchell, one of the state\u2019s leading analysts of the redistricting process, said that two places could dominate the discussion: the communities sitting at the intersection of Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties and the suburbs to the east of San Francisco.\n\nBut other big changes to the political map-drawing process are also in store \u2014 including the 2013 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court to strike part of the federal Voting Rights Act that strongly influenced the current California maps.\n\n\u201cThat will allow a massive rewrite of the Central Valley congressional districts, so it might be really hard to see the total impact\u201d of losing a House seat because of population, Mitchell said.\n\nEven so, the most obvious political impact would be to force incumbent House members to either run against each other or leave office. In 2012, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Northridge) defeated former Rep. Howard Berman in a bitter contest brought on by the new lines drawn in Los Angeles County.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s future numerical strength in Congress hinges in part on making sure that members of historically undercounted groups are included in the census count. In California, 72% of the population belongs to one of these groups, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nState census workers, community organizations and local politicians started outreach efforts as early as April to ensure an accurate tally in next year\u2019s count. In addition to reapportionment, nearly $800 billion in federal tax dollars and political redistricting are at stake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nState government leaders have allocated about $187 million to help verify addresses and expand outreach efforts, according to California\u2019s census office.\n\nStill, there will be major hurdles. Those without reliable internet connections may be missed in a census that will rely heavily on online surveys. Los Angeles County, officials say, will be the nation\u2019s hardest to tally because of its high concentrations of renters and homeless people, as well as immigrant communities that may not participate, either because of language barriers or because they fear being targeted by federal immigration authorities.\n\n\u201cIf, as many fear, non-citizen populations and the state\u2019s heavily Latino population either fails to participate or participates without providing full household counts, then California could lose more than one seat,\u201d said Mitchell, whose firm analyzes political data for regional and statewide candidates.\n\nNationally, natural increase (births minus deaths) has declined steadily over the past decade. The U.S. also registered a decline in its population under the age of 18, Frey, the demographer, said. California led in that category, with a drop of about 400,000 people under the age of 18, followed by Illinois and New York. The South and West saw the biggest gain in children, Frey added, led by Texas.\n\n\u201cThis is a symptom of an aging population,\u201d he said, \u201cand in states like California, an out-migration of younger families with children.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s representation stayed the same following the 2010 census count. If the state does lose a seat or two in 2020, Frey said, it\u2019s uncertain whether the decline would carry into the 2030 count.\n\n\u201cIn a way, these last few years are a confluence of things that may not continue over time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe slowdown in immigration may not continue, millennials may finally start having kids. Domestic out-migration may continue. All those things happened at the same time, so I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be quite as dim in the next few years.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Things to Do"], "authors": ["Sarah Parvini Covers California S Demographics", "Diverse Communities For The Los Angeles Times", "Metro Desk.", "John Myers Joined The Los Angeles Times As Sacramento Bureau Chief In", "Has Spent More Than Two Decades Covering California Politics", "State Government"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "California is poised to lose a congressional seat for the first time in its history as a state, based on U.S. Census Bureau population estimates released Monday that showed the nation\u2019s growth continued to slow in 2019.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "California could lose a congressional district following 2020 census count", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-12-31/la-me-ln-california-apportionment-2020-census", "image": {"identifier": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/351a7f6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+99/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fba%2Fa2%2F6033c4616dfe5c0bf9f49d0cc1b7%2Fla-1553546566-y0h34cceac-snap-image", "url": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/351a7f6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+99/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fba%2Fa2%2F6033c4616dfe5c0bf9f49d0cc1b7%2Fla-1553546566-y0h34cceac-snap-image", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg", "alt": "FILE - This March 23, 2018 file photo shows an envelope containing a 2018 census letter mailed to a"}, "description": "California\u2019s potential loss would drop the state\u2019s seats in the U.S. House of Representatives from 53 to 52.", "site_name": "Los Angeles Times", "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.latimes.com/people/john-myers", "content_tier": "metered", "published_time": "2019-12-31T11:00:51.537", "opinion": "false", "section": "California"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@sarahparvini", "description": "California\u2019s potential loss would drop the state\u2019s seats in the U.S. House of Representatives from 53 to 52.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fc01356/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+61/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fba%2Fa2%2F6033c4616dfe5c0bf9f49d0cc1b7%2Fla-1553546566-y0h34cceac-snap-image", "alt": "FILE - This March 23, 2018 file photo shows an envelope containing a 2018 census letter mailed to a"}, "site": "@latimes", "title": "California could lose a congressional district following 2020 census count"}, "fb": {"app_id": 119932621434123, "pages": 5863113009, "profile_id": "latimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5", "description": "California is poised to lose a congressional seat for the first time in its history as a state, based on U.S. Census Bureau population estimates released Monday that showed the nation\u2019s growth continued to slow in 2019.", "brightspot.contentId": "0000016f-583e-d233-abef-dbfe64e70000", "brightspot.cached": "false"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-12-31/la-me-ln-california-apportionment-2020-census"}
