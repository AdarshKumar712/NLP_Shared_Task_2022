She was among eight people who held the innovative protest by drawing kolam (rangoli) before they were arrested and detained at a wedding hall on December 29. They were later released.A few organisations like the Welfare Party of India, Arappor Iyakkam and Campus Front of India support her. \"We will probe the level of her links with Pakistan,\" the commissioner said.The website of Bytes for All (B4A), Pakistan says it is a human rights organisation and a research think tank with a focus on information and communication technologies. It organises discussions on relevant topics, presents findings, mobilises opinion.On the eight people being booked, Viswanathan said no permission was issued to them to protest against CAA and NRC. \"Police did not interfere until an issue was created. A protester drew the anti-CAA messages despite opposition from a houseowner,\" he said and showed a video of a nonagenarian saying anti-CAA messages were drawn before his house without his permission.Later, incensed at the arrest of the protesters, DMK leaders and partymen drew similar kolams in front of their houses.Protests, meanwhile, continued across Tamil Nadu . At midnight on Tuesday, as many as 200 activists decided to go on a procession from Panagal Maligai to Raj Bhavan when police stopped them. They raised slogans for nearly an hour and dispersed. In Nagapattinam, more than 2,000 people took out a rally on Wednesday demanding that the Centre revoke CAA. The procession, led by Nagappattinam MLA Thamimun Ansari and Kilvelur DMK MLA U Mathivanan, got participation from others parties. In Trichy, police booked members of Makkal Adhikaram, who were also holding an anti-CAA protest, for unlawful assembly.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Chennai news", "Chennai latest news", "Chennai news live", "Chennai news today", "Today news Chennai", "tamil nadu", "chennai protest", "Chennai CAA Protest", "CAA Protest Chennai", "anti-CAA kolam protests"], "tags": ["Chennai rain", "Mumbai Rains", "IMD forecast", "Chennai Rains", "Delhi Pollution", "DMK", "Mumbai Floods", "Jallikattu", "Chennai accident", "anti-CAA kolam protests", "Bangalore Rains", "Floods in Chennai", "Panneerselvam", "MK Stalin", "Chennai weather", "AIADMK", "Delhi Earthquake", "Edappadi K Palaniswami"], "authors": ["Tnn", "Updated", "Jan"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A few organisations like the Welfare Party of India, Arappor Iyakkam and Campus Front of India support her.\"We will probe the level of her links with", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A few organisations like the Welfare Party of India, Arappor Iyakkam and Campus Front of India support her.\"We will probe the level of her links with", "keywords": "Chennai news, Chennai latest news, Chennai news live, Chennai news today, Today news Chennai,tamil nadu,chennai protest,Chennai CAA Protest,CAA Protest Chennai,anti-CAA kolam protests", "og": {"title": "CAA Protest Chennai: Cops probing kolam protester's Pakistan 'link' | Chennai News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/caa-cops-probing-kolam-protesters-pak-link/articleshow/73064323.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73066148,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-639910,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "A few organisations like the Welfare Party of India, Arappor Iyakkam and Campus Front of India support her.\"We will probe the level of her links with", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/caa-cops-probing-kolam-protesters-pak-link/articleshow/73064323.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73066148,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-639910,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "CAA Protest Chennai: Cops probing kolam protester's Pakistan 'link' | Chennai News - Times of India", "description": "A few organisations like the Welfare Party of India, Arappor Iyakkam and Campus Front of India support her.\"We will probe the level of her links with", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/caa-cops-probing-kolam-protesters-pak-link/articleshow/73064323.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 26781952138, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0", "robots": "NOODP"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/caa-cops-probing-kolam-protesters-pak-link/articleshow/73064323.cms"}
