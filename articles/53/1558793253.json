It was the reveal of the Slave Lake Business Survey and an economic development talk, by Ken Coates.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe information in the survey is based on how the businesses feel the community supports them,\u201d says Josh Friesen, Community Futures Executive-Director. Once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the survey has information to \u201cpave the way for a new future for the town.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe pandemic itself is horrible, he adds, but \u201cit gives us opportunities to reflect on better ways to do business.\u201d\n\n\n\nCoates spoke about 12 reasons people in rural areas should be more scared, 12 reasons they should be excited, and 12 ways they can compete in the global economy. There\u2019s a global decline in rural areas was one of the negatives. Two of the exciting prospects were the empowerment of Indigenous Canadians and new opportunities for self-sufficiency.\n\n\n\nThree suggests for economic development are change the story, suggest practical innovative solutions, and understand what young professionals look for in a community.\n\n\n\nThe survey and labour solutions event was put on by Community Futures, Slave Lake and District Chamber of Commerce, and the Town of Slave Lake.\n\n\n\nThere were around 35 people at the event and over 500 people have viewed the video of Coate\u2019s speech online.\n\n\n\nIt was bad timing, says Kimberley Hughes, Slave Lake and District Chamber of Commerce Executive-Director, but \u201cthe right people were there.\u201d She continues, the event sparked some ideas, and the feedback has been positive.\n\n\n\nThe launch was supposed to be the first event in a series of labour solutions events, but these have been postponed due to COVID-19. Community Futures physical office is closed, but open for business via phone or email.\n\n\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce is closely monitoring the situation of the trade show and Riverboat Daze, which are in May and July respectively.\n\nSome of the attendees at the Slave Lake labour survey reveal on March 12.
