Bulgaria is one of the greatest supporters of North Macedonia since its independence, and this support of ours will continue throughout the processes for integration of your country in the EU. We recognise the language registered in the constitution of your country. For example, Germany and Austria speak the same language, but have no disputes about it. Many of the people here in Bulgaria believe that that specific thing is as if we have given up on our history.
