The campaign launched in November and has already resulted in a 35 percent jump in visitors filling out the initial forms on the Army\u2019s website, compared to November 2018.\n\nBrig. Gen. Alex Fink, chief of Army enterprise marketing, is behind \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Warrior?\u201d. He said filling out those forms is just the first step.\n\n\u201cIt's great and fine and dandy to fill out a business reply card online,\u201d Fink said. \u201cBut, how does that translate into actually getting folks to make a commitment?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where the individual relationship between recruit and recruiter comes in.\n\nDan Boyce/CPR News Colorado Springs Army Recruiting Company Commander Josh Trenkel speaks with new recruits during a tour of Fort Carson Army Base.\n\nColorado Springs Army Recruiting Company Cmdr. Josh Trenkel said his recruiters are using \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Warrior?\u201d to simply start the conversation about joining.\n\n\u201cThat's where the art of it is,\u201d Trenkel said. \u201cThey really need to know how to take that message, and give it to the students coming out of school these days and make sure that they know the opportunities that are available to them.\u201d\n\nTrenkel was supervising a tour at Fort Carson Army Base for brand new recruits. The group took turns in a shooting simulator, peeked inside military vehicles and were treated to an old Army standard, a Meal Ready to Eat (MRE), for lunch.\n\nCrystal Townsend was sitting on the grass with other new recruits, opening her vegetable crumble MRE.\n\n\u201cWhen I was younger, when I was 18, 19, I did want to join, but I wasn't really competent in myself,\u201d Townsend, now 35, said. \u201cI didn't know anybody in the military and I wasn't really sure I could do it.\u201d\n\nDan Boyce/CPR News New Army recruits try out a shooting simulation at Fort Carson Army Base.\n\nTownsend ended up in law enforcement, rising in the ranks to become a deputy sheriff in El Paso County. It\u2019s a stable job in a professional career, but as she got older and closer to the maximum age for enlistment, she found herself having regrets.\n\n\u201cIt was just eating at me. And I finally said, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m gonna go for it,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nSitting near her were younger men and women just out of high school and looking for more than the classic Army experience as a gunner or infantryman. One woman nearby was looking to go into communications, another man hoping to jumpstart a career as a firefighter. The range of ambitions these recruits have is exactly how the Army is hoping to sell itself through \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Warrior?\u201d\n\nThe first ad in the campaign looks more like a trailer for an effects-laden superhero movie than a traditional recruitment pitch, with helicopters flying through mountain passes and microscopic cells dividing on screen.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Army", "Colorado Springs", "Fort Carson", "Military"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Dan Boyce"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The recruitment campaign launched in November and has already resulted in a 35 percent jump in visitors filling out the initial forms on the Army\u2019s website.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "static/media/favicon.b75ef52b.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "description": "The recruitment campaign launched in November and has already resulted in a 35 percent jump in visitors filling out the initial forms on the Army\u2019s website.", "keywords": "Army,Colorado Springs,Fort Carson,Military", "og": {"url": "https://www.cpr.org/2020/01/01/there-are-more-roles-in-military-service-than-infantrymen-whats-your-warrior-wants-to-showcase-more-to-recruits/", "type": "article", "title": "There Are More Roles In Military Service Than Infantrymen. \u2018What\u2019s Your Warrior?\u2019 Wants To Showcase More To Recruits", "description": "The recruitment campaign launched in November and has already resulted in a 35 percent jump in visitors filling out the initial forms on the Army\u2019s website.", "site_name": "Colorado Public Radio", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/12/TOWNSEND-scaled.jpg?resize=1200,600", "width": 2560, "height": 1707}, "width": 2560, "height": 1707}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "There Are More Roles In Military Service Than Infantrymen. \u2018What\u2019s Your Warrior?\u2019 Wants To Showcase More To Recruits", "description": "The recruitment campaign launched in November and has already resulted in a 35 percent jump in visitors filling out the initial forms on the Army\u2019s website.", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/12/TOWNSEND-scaled.jpg?resize=1200,600", "url": "https://www.cpr.org/2020/01/01/there-are-more-roles-in-military-service-than-infantrymen-whats-your-warrior-wants-to-showcase-more-to-recruits/"}, "author": "Dan Boyce", "category": "Military", "has_audio": 0, "datePublished": "2020-01-01T04:00:00-07:00", "story_id": 412689, "wordCount": 651}, "canonical_link": "https://www.cpr.org/2020/01/01/there-are-more-roles-in-military-service-than-infantrymen-whats-your-warrior-wants-to-showcase-more-to-recruits/"}
