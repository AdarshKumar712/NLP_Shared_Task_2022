It operated in all parts of Ireland except in Dublin, where the DMP was the police force during the same period.\n\nMr Flanagan in September became the first government minister to attend a commemoration service for policemen killed by the IRA in the War of Independence.\n\nMinisters have traditionally shied away from such services because of the role of both forces in opposing those who sought Irish independence through armed actions.\n\nThe armed RIC was in the vanguard of British resistence to the IRA during the War of Independence causing thousands to quit the force. D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann organised a boycott of the force from April 1919 on and the mass burning of RIC barracks began in January 1920.\n\nWhen the British government realised the RIC was not up to the task of defending British rule in Ireland, they drafted in the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries, mercenary soldiers from Britain, to take the fight to the IRA.\n\nIn September, Mr Flanagan was a guest at the annual interdenominational service for members of the RIC and DMP held at the Church of St Paul of the Cross in Mount Argus in Dublin.\n\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar was represented by his aide-de-camp Commandant Caroline Burke at the service.\n\nThe names of 11 RIC and four DMP men killed in 1919 during the first year of the War of Independence were read out.\n\nSpeaking to The Irish Times after the service, Mr Flanagan said he attended because the policemen involved were \u201cdoing their job. They were murdered in the line of duty.\n\n\u201cThey were doing what police officers do. As they saw it they were protecting communities from harm. They were maintaining the rule of law. These are fundamental to police services everywhere.\u201d\n\nMr Flanagan described himself as a \u201cpluralist who believes in the co-existence of peoples of different traditions on the island coming together.\n\n\u201cAs Minister for Justice, I acknowledge that being a policeman is a very tough job. The men that we commemorated were all killed in the line of duty.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI believe very strongly in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and, in the spirit of co-existence. These are sensitive ceremonies and they are very important to me.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental basis of the Good Friday Agreement brings people together. I see the fundamental principle of Brexit being the opposite.\n\n\u201cThese are difficult and sensitive issues. We cannot any longer ignore them or be partisan. I believe I have a duty as Minister for Justice to police officers.\u201d\n\nThe decision by the State to hold a service to remember the RIC and DMP has been welcomed by the Historical & Reconciliatory Police (HARP) Society set up in 2012 to remember Irish policemen killed on duty between 1836 and 1922 of whom 525 were killed during the War of Independence.\n\nSpokesman Jim Herlihy said: \u201cThe Harp Society are delighted with the initiative now taken by Government in at long last hosting the forthcoming event in Dublin Castle and are also in hope that such an event will lead to the provision of a fitting permanent memorial to commemorate the sacrifice made by the 642 members of Royal Irish Constabulary and the 30 members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police between 1836 and 1922.\u201d\n\nMr Herlihy said his extensive research over the last number of years reveals that 10,936 Black and Tans and 2,264 Auxiliaries served in Ireland during the War of Independence.\n\nOf those, 152 Black and Tans and 44 Auxilaries were killed.\n\nHis research also reveals that 883 Black and Tans were Irish-born and 126 Auxilaries were Irish.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Dublin Castle service to remember those killed in War of Independence", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/assets/images/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "Dublin Castle service to remember those killed in War of Independence", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14128214"}, "news_keywords": "News, Argus Mount, Caroline Burke, Charlie Flanagan, Drew Harris, Jim Herlihy, Leo Varadkar, Ronan Mcgreevy, Royal, British Government, CROSS, Dail Eireann, Dublin Metropolitan Police, Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, Harp Society, Historical & Reconciliatory Police, Irish Constabulary, Irish Republican Army, Dublin(IE), Ireland, United Kingdom", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "RIC and DMP policemen to be commemorated for first time by State", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/ric-and-dmp-policemen-to-be-commemorated-for-first-time-by-state-1.4128214", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "Dublin Castle service to remember those killed in War of Independence", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4128213&origw=1440", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4128213&origw=1440", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimes", "creator": "@RMcGreevy1301", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/ric-and-dmp-policemen-to-be-commemorated-for-first-time-by-state-1.4128214", "title": "RIC and DMP policemen to be commemorated for first time by State", "description": "Dublin Castle service to remember those killed in War of Independence", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128213.1577885372!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/ric-and-dmp-policemen-to-be-commemorated-for-first-time-by-state-1.4128214"}
