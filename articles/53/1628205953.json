Floyd.\n\nFollowing mass anti-racism protests across the UK on Saturday, the shadow foreign secretary said that tackling the issue requires taking an active stance.\n\nMs Nandy said that she is \u201cproud\u201d of the young people demanding change, while urging them to take precautions when they take part in protests during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nShe told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr programme: \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the most important things about living in a free society is that people can go out and protest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said repeatedly that it must be safe, people should social distance \u2013 please take precautions \u2013 but I\u2019m very proud of those young people who are coming out and speaking up.\n\nRead more Hundreds to descend on London for new

take an active stance against it.\n\n\u201cYou cannot be silent in the face of racism and police brutality, and I think those young people are right to raise their voices and to demand change.\u201d\n\nMs Nandy also appealed to the small number of people who have used violence at the Black Lives Matter protests to stop.\n\nLondon: Black Lives Matter George Floyd protest - In

she would say to those who verbally abused and threw objects at police, she said: \u201cI would say to them it\u2019s wrong, stop it.\n\n\u201cAnd more than that, as well as it just being completely wrong to attack police officers who are trying to keep the peace, many of whom are deeply sympathetic with the sentiment behind these protests, who are struggling as well to deal with Covid and help to keep public order in a really unprecedented situation, it also has the effect of dampening the voices of those who are calling for change.\n\n\u201cBecause the newspapers this morning, the headlines were dominated by the fact that there was violence, a small number using violence at the London protest.\n\n\u201cAnd actually across this country and across the world, you\u2019ve got people coming out in the tens of thousands to protest peacefully and to raise their voices for change, and they\u2019re the voices that I want to hear.\u201d\n\nThe Labour MP for Wigan also said the UK Government cannot remain silent on police brutality in the United States.\n\n\u201cI actually think this is a deliberate election strategy,\u201d she said of the actions being taken by US President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019ve no idea whether Donald Trump is a racist or not a racist, what I do know is that in the run-up to the American elections, this is one of the ways that politicians try to activate their base.\n\n\u201cThey divide people in order to try to advance their own cause and that\u2019s actually one of the things that is so damaging about it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s crept into our politics in Britain in the last few years and we\u2019re seeing under the cover of Covid, other countries trying to do something similar \u2013 rowing back on people\u2019s freedoms, human rights, the rule of law, democracy.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019ve said this Government cannot remain silent in the face of that.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords":
