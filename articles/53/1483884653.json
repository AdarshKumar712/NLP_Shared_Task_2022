New You?\n\nIt\u2019s the time of year where things get a bit hectic. And we can get consumed by it all. Which is absolutely fine. Just enjoy the ride.\n\nBut what happens after the festivities are over? Where do we go then?\n\nI\u2019m sure the vast majority will conjure up some form of new year\u2019s resolution. Most of which will fall by the wayside within a few weeks of the new year. Why? Because we set such a big task, that when it starts to get difficult, we lose focus, lose interest, and ultimately lose the motivation to continue.\n\nInstead of giving yourself a new year\u2019s resolution, why not try the following:\n\nSet yourself goals and targets to complete by the end of the year.\n\nYes, it\u2019s essentially the same thing, but by getting away from the \u2018resolution\u2019 tag and focusing on hitting smaller goals, that consequentially result in the larger objective, we can digest each goal more easily, and therefore maintain motivation.\n\nIf you hit a smaller target within the first few weeks of the new year, then you\u2019re far more likely to stay motivated and push onto the next goal.\n\nSet goals, break them down, and go about each individual goal with full focus.\n\nMake 2020 the year you finally get things done.\n\nWe spend far too long planning and preparing without taking any action. Now is the time to take action. Massive action. Stop delaying.\n\nTake the next week or two to strategise the year ahead. But don\u2019t wait until January 1 to start cracking on with your goals. Start NOW!\n\nYes, you may make the odd mistake, and that\u2019s totally fine. Learn from it and use it to spur you on to a great 2020!\n\nThe more we think about something, the more likely we are to not go ahead with it.\n\nGo on... Start today. Learn as you go. And 2020 will be a fantastic year.\n\nMark Davies\n\nZenith Fit Personal Trainer & Online Coach\n\nTel: 07837 950 573\n\nWeb: www.zenithfit.co.uk\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/zenithfit/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zenith_fit\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zenith_fit/", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 07:01:03 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "New Year...
