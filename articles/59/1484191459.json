If they are poor readers early on, they tend, on average, to remain so.\n\nAs the teacher explained:\n\nWe\u2019re in a race to give these children the skills to succeed. When they come to us already so far behind in first grade, it\u2019s impossible for some to ever catch up. We try. We really try. But we need more help from the parents, the pre-Ks and the kindergartens.\n\n(Some teachers commented that children who learn to read before kindergarten are not really able to handle such a complex skill. But an Early Childhood Literacy study found that students who are read to and who learn basic reading skills before kindergarten have a more positive association with books and make substantial academic gains once they develop full literacy.)\n\nThe teacher\u2019s overall point: Young children are capable of more than historically has been asked of them in U.S. kindergartens, which she believes have been resistant to imposing more ambitious academic standards.\n\nShe spent five weeks in China on an education exchange, and, while she abhorred classrooms of 50 students, she was dazzled by the mathematical fluency of even young children. \u201cWe were not in a rich region of China. These were children whose parents were laborers, not bankers.\u201d\n\nBut is the answer more drilling, testing and worksheets in kindergarten?\n\nGeorgia education professor Bryan P. Sorohan made this point in an email to me:\n\nThe statistics reported on socioeconomic differences in school readiness are indisputable, and factor into much of the discussion on school issues. Likewise, I have no reason to doubt the lifetime effects reported for disparities in school readiness: students who are not ready to read when they start school will undoubtedly experience lifelong disparities in educational and other outcomes. The causes for these effects are not simple. Students from poorer families may not be ready to read by age five for a variety of reasons: obstacles to parental involvement related to economic needs, nutritional deficiencies, lack of exposure to information-rich and educative resources in the home and elsewhere (also due to family economic needs) and many others. Research shows that reading to children is one simple factor that greatly increases reading readiness, for example, but parents who are working multiple jobs just to keep the lights on and food on the table are not going to have the same time to read to their children as wealthier parents. Providing access to high-quality preschool is one way to help remedy this problem, but poor parents also do not have the ability to pay for that kind of educational preparation.\n\nThe problem, said Sorohan, is that children lagging in needed skills aren\u2019t being helped by our current solution of turning kindergarten into first grade.\n\nThe real problems arise in the way school bureaucracies respond to these realities. Several other facts have to be taken into consideration: first, a student who is not developmentally ready to start reading is not going to be magically catapulted into readiness through a curriculum that is not appropriate for their current developmental level. Nature and human development cannot be altered by just expecting children to learn something we want them to learn before they are ready. The example of Finnish Schools is instructive: they emphasize play and pre-literate reading-related activities , and their literacy rate is one we can only envy. (As an aside, I have actually heard people attribute the educational achievements of the Finns to their relatively homogeneous society, whereas it is the U.S. system that attempts to force a very diverse society into a one-size-fits-all educational system). US bureaucracies, however, respond by essentially denying the socioeconomic factors in school readiness and the realities of human cognitive development. Part of the reason may be that, for some reason, the US continues to put non-educators in leadership positions in our educational establishment. Expecting a business or military professional, regardless of their success in their chosen fields, to understand educational realities has pretty much proven to be a fool's errand. Part of the problem also lies in the high-stakes, punitive style of educational accountability we practice here: too many educational leaders understand that their jobs depend on this year's test scores, not long-term results, and react by retreating into familiar but ultimately detrimental solutions based on approaches they think are \"rigorous.\"\n\n\n\nThe irony is that the very meaning of the term \"kindergarten\" is \"child's garden,\" reflecting the origins of the concept as a place where children played, explored, and developed according to natural, human processes. The overwrought and reactionary type of educational \"reform\" that US schools have been stampeded into for the past three decades has led educational bureaucracies to essentially deny the realities of how children learn and develop. Thankfully, teachers such as those at Boston's Brookline schools have finally decided to put their feet down against the kind of abusive bureaucratic nonsense we've been fed about our schools.\n\nSupport real journalism.
