If they hadn\u00b4t been passing by, we wouldn\u00b4t have known my son had been killed,\" he told AFP.\n\nAmong the victims was an elderly couple trapped inside their home in a district where floodwaters reached as high as four metres (13 feet) after a river burst its banks.\n\nAnother victim drowned while four people were killed after the Tuesday evening downpour triggered landslides in the city\u00b4s outskirts.\n\n\"We have shut down power (in many areas) to avoid more electrical shocks,\" Ikhsan Asaad, an official at state firm PLN, told AFP.\n\nAsaad said he could not estimate how many residents had been affected by the power shutdown.\n\n\"We\u00b4re currently focusing on taking measures to ensure people\u00b4s safety,\" he added.\n\nAngelina Widiyanti was among scores of residents whose houses were flooded with their possessions ruined by the disaster.\n\n\"We\u00b4ve had flooding several times before but it was never this high,\" she said from her home, where the power had been cut.\n\n\"We weren\u00b4t prepared for this.\"\n\nAuthorities said about 19,000 people were evacuated, but that figure did not include residents in Jakarta\u00b4s satellite cities.\n\n\"We\u00b4re evacuating people right now,\" Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan told reporters.\n\n\"Everyone living near rivers should anticipate (more) flooding,\" he added.\n\nImages from across the region showed waterlogged homes and cars submerged in muddy floodwaters, while some people took to paddling in small rubber lifeboats or tyre inner-tubes to get around.\n\nThe disaster marked Jakarta\u00b4s worst flooding since 2013 when several dozen people were killed when the city was inundated by monsoon rains.\n\nJakarta is regularly hit by floods during Indonesia\u00b4s rainy season, which started in late November.\n\nOn Wednesday, service at Halim Perdanakusuma airport, which handles commercial and military planes, was temporarily shut due to severe flooding on its runways, according to the transport ministry.\n\nMany flights were transferred to Jakarta\u00b4s main Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Thousands were evacuated to temporary shelters as electricity was switched off in scores of waterlogged neighbourhoods across greater Jakarta", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/gn-icons/57x57.png", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 806127442825208}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "TITLE": "Nine dead after Indonesian capital hit by new year flooding | World - Geo.tv", "description": "Thousands were evacuated to temporary shelters as electricity was switched off in scores of waterlogged neighbourhoods across greater Jakarta", "og": {"title": "Nine dead after Indonesian capital hit by new year flooding", "image": "https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-01-01/265061_080614_updates.jpg", "description": "Thousands were evacuated to temporary shelters as electricity was switched off in scores of waterlogged neighbourhoods across greater Jakarta", "url": "https://www.geo.tv/latest/265061-nine-dead-after-indonesian-capital-hit-by-new-year-flooding", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@geonews_english", "creator": "@AFP", "title": "Nine dead after Indonesian capital hit by new year flooding", "description": "Thousands were evacuated to temporary shelters as electricity was switched off in scores of waterlogged neighbourhoods across greater Jakarta", "image": "https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-01-01/265061_080614_updates.jpg"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Geo News", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/gn-icons/144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#0D3975"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.geo.tv/latest/265061-nine-dead-after-indonesian-capital-hit-by-new-year-flooding"}
