\u2013 Former President\n\nJohn Dramani Mahama and Presidential flagbearer of the National Democratic\n\nCongress has expressed concern about the growing loss of faith and trust in the\n\ncountry\u2019s democratic system.\n\nHe described it as a \u2018looming danger\u2019 to\n\ndemocracy and could be dangerous to citizens.\n\nHe said it was manifesting with apathy\n\ntowards elections and demands of money and material things in exchange for\n\npolitical support, adding that, monitisation made politics more expensive and\n\ncontinued to fuel corruption in the country.\n\nFormer President Mahama shared these views\n\nat the 38th anniversary of the 31st December Revolution in Winneba on Tuesday\n\non the theme, \u201cMonetization of Elections in Ghana: \u2018A threat to National\n\nDevelopment and Genuine Democracy.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Ghanaians had become\n\ndespondent with strong sentiments that no matter what happened, there could be\n\nno significant transformation in their lives.\n\nHe blamed the practice on the arrogance of\n\npower, lack of humility and modesty in public service and waste of national\n\nresources by public office bearers and stressed the need to the Country to work\n\ntowards restoring modesty and humility in government, while identifying with\n\nthe sacrifices of the people.\n\n\u201cThe only means we can bring back the trust\n\nof our people and minimize monitisation in our politics is to uphold the\n\nrevolutionary principles of probity and accountability. We must be prepared to\n\nbe probed and to be accountable\u201d, he said\n\nHe said there was the need to step up the\n\nfight against corruption and nepotism, while strengthening the assets\n\ndeclaration regime of the country.\n\nMr. Mahama said a new NDC government would\n\nseek to review the law and ensure that every public office holder including;\n\nthe president would declare their assets and publish those assets for all\n\nGhanaians to see.\n\nHe urged supporters of the NDC to reflect on\n\nthe principles of probity and accountability as trumpeted by the\n\n31st December Revolution to work hard for victory in 2020.\n\nHe said the 31st December Revolution,\n\nwhich played a pivotal role in the history of the Country, laid a solid\n\nfoundation for the 4th republic and the formulation of the 1992\n\nconstitution.\n\nFormer President John Jerry\n\nRawlings bemoaned the level of corruption in the Country saying, \u201ccorruption\n\nhas eaten so deep into the fabric of the masses of our country that it has\n\ntaken away that team spirit at the grassroots\u201d.\n\nHe said it was time the Country drew lessons\n\nfrom the two incidents to reform, transform and improve upon justice and freedom\n\nin the society.\n\nHe underscored the need to give due\n\nrespect to all deserving people and not only to people of high social class.\n\nGNA", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.ghanamma.com/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.ghanamma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/former-president-john-dramani-mahama.jpg"}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "By Afedzi Abdullah, GNA Winneba (C/R) Jan 01, GNA \u2013 Former President John Dramani Mahama and Presidential flagbearer of the National Democratic Congress has expressed concern about the growing loss of faith and trust in the country\u2019s democratic system.
