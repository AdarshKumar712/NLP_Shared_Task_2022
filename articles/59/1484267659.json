You shudder, cringe, comment about hygiene practices \u2026 and then move on because what are you actually going to do about the fact that [the thing you can\u2019t avoid touching] has cooties? Here\u2019s what becomes clear after a few rounds of this: Every damn thing has more germs than a toilet seat\u2014and one surprising reason may be that toilet seats actually aren\u2019t that dirty, perhaps because people think they\u2019re so dirty that they get cleaned a lot.\n\nThe dirtier-than-a-toilet-seat list includes cell phones, steering wheels, shopping carts, restaurant menus, and restaurant high chairs. It includes just about everything in the kitchen, starting with your sponges and cleaning cloths and going on to your cutting board and faucet. All of which are positively teeming with germs. Your clean laundry? Maybe not so clean.\n\nIn public, add on money, ATMs, elevator buttons, door handles, and \u2026 you know what? If a lot of people touch it, it is extremely dirty.\n\nIn short, guys, maybe this is not something to get so worked up about.
