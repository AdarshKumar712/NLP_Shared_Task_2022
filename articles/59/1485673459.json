I was pregnant at the time. I was about seven, eight months pregnant, I was having breakfast, I opened my phone and immediately I just lost it.\u201d\n\nShe said she was \u201cpissed\u201d and immediately called Hart crying.\n\n\u201cRight then and there I kept saying \u2018How the f*** did you let that happen?'\u201d she said.\n\nBut it was her insistence that her husband has become a \u201cbetter man\u201d and their relationship is stronger that has rubbed some people the wrong way.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that Eniko Hart could not envision a scenario where Kevin Hart grew as a person in a loving and kind way that did not come at her expense,\u201d one person tweeted. \u201cThe bar is so low.\u201d\n\nHart also addressed the backlash he received following an January 2019 interview with \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cJumanji\u201d star made an appearance to quell controversy after homophobic tweets from 2010 and 2011 resurfaced which caused him to bow out of hosting the Academy Awards.\n\nBut his morning talk-show appearance made the situation worse when he said he had already addressed the situation with an apology and was over it.\n\n\u201cWhat I thought that was going to do, it did not do,\u201d Hart said on his Netflix series of his comments on \u201cGMA.\u201d The complete opposite happened.\u201d\n\nAfter reflecting on it Hart said, \u201cI missed an opportunity to say simply that I don\u2019t condone any type of violence in any way, shape or form to anyone for being who they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just immature,\u201d he said of how he handled the fallout.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.
