They handled the matter with a prejudiced approach.\u201d\u201cThree constables \u2013 Kanhaiya Lal, Sudhakar Yadav and Pramod Kumar Singh \u2013 did not act as per rule of law and followed directions of their senior officers. As a result, 30 days\u2019 salary of these cops will not be given to them for their services,\u201d he added. On July17 last year, a group of villagers belonging to Gond tribe were carrying out farming on disputed land when a group of men, led by gram pradhan Yagya Dutt, reached there to take possession of the land which, they claimed, was purchased by him and his relatives in 2017.This led to violence which left 11 tribals killed and 21 others injured.The government ordered an SIT probe into the incident which is still pending.Sonabahdra district police also launched a probe into the role of cops who had served at Ghorawal police station under whose jurisdiction Umbha village falls. On October 14, police also filed a chargesheet against 51 people.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Lucknow news", "Lucknow latest news", "Lucknow news live", "Lucknow news today", "Today news Lucknow", "Uttar Pradesh", "Umbha violence", "news of lucknow", "lucknow news", "ive lax cops fined with 30-day salary cut"], "tags": ["Delhi Air Pollution", "Fire in Mumbai", "Mumbai Rains", "Hyderabad Rain", "Bangalore Temperature", "Delhi Temperature", "Srinagar encounter", "Chennai Weather", "Delhi Smog"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Nearly six months after 11 tribals were killed in indiscriminate firing by the head of Umbha village in Sonbhadra over a land dispute, police authorit", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Nearly six months after 11 tribals were killed in indiscriminate firing by the head of Umbha village in Sonbhadra over a land dispute, police authorit", "keywords": "Lucknow news, Lucknow latest news, Lucknow news live, Lucknow news today, Today news Lucknow,Uttar Pradesh,Umbha violence,news of lucknow,lucknow news,ive lax cops fined with 30-day salary cut", "robots": "NOODP", "og": {"title": "Umbha violence: Five lax cops fined with 30-day salary cut | Lucknow News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/umbha-violence-five-lax-cops-fined-with-30-day-salary-cut/articleshow/73063597.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063703,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-216803,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "Nearly six months after 11 tribals were killed in indiscriminate firing by the head of Umbha village in Sonbhadra over a land dispute, police authorit", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/umbha-violence-five-lax-cops-fined-with-30-day-salary-cut/articleshow/73063597.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063703,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-216803,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "Umbha violence: Five lax cops fined with 30-day salary cut | Lucknow News - Times of India", "description": "Nearly six months after 11 tribals were killed in indiscriminate firing by the head of Umbha village in Sonbhadra over a land dispute, police authorit", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "news_keywords": "Uttar Pradesh,Umbha violence,news of lucknow,lucknow news,ive lax cops fined with 30-day salary cut", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/umbha-violence-five-lax-cops-fined-with-30-day-salary-cut/articleshow/73063597.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 227797153941209, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/umbha-violence-five-lax-cops-fined-with-30-day-salary-cut/articleshow/73063597.cms"}
