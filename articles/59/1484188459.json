The Bulldogs have taken part in 11 practise sessions since losing to LSU in the SEC Championship on December 7.\n\n\"We've had to make the practices different, and the kids have been really competitive,\" Smart added.\n\n\"We've made sure we've held everyone to a standard, and that standard is, 'I'm going to come compete and come to play, and if you weren't going to compete at that standard, then you weren't going to be here.\"\n\nAs this graphic provided by Statista shows, the Bulldogs and the Bears arrive in New Orleans as the No. 5 and No. 7 ranked teams in the College Football Playoff standings.\n\nBoth teams lost their conference title games last month, with Georgia falling 37-10 to LSU and Baylor losing 30-23 in overtime against Oklahoma and both teams will be looking to bounce back in New Orleans.\n\nFew players are as desperate to put the conference title game behind them as Jake Fromm. The Bulldogs quarterback injured his left ankle against LSU and endured the worst performance of his college career, completing just 20 of 42 passes for 225 yards, one touchdown and two picks.\n\nFromm has recovered from his ankle injury and will be available on Wednesday, unlike offensive tackles Isaiah Wilson and Andrew Thomas, who have quit the team to prepare for the NFL draft.\n\nGeorgia is a 5.5-point favorite, but it's just 7-6 against the spread this season, while Baylor is 9-4 and has covered by an average of seven points.\n\nThe over/under line in terms of total points scored is set at 41.5, the lowest of any of the New Year's Six bowl games, which is hardly surprising given Georgia ranks fourth in total defense and second in scoring defense in college football this season, while Baylor ranks 40th and 16th respectively.\n\nCrucially, however, Baylor has allowed almost twice as many rushing yards as Georgia, which doesn't bode well for its prospect of stopping D'Andre Swift, who has rushed for 1,216 yards and seven touchdowns this season.\n\nThe onus of limiting the junior running back will fall on a defensive line containing James Lynch, the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nThe biggest distraction for Baylor could come off the field, following the news head coach Matt Rhule will be interviewing with the Carolina Panthers, who fired head coach Ron Rivera in December.\n\nRhule has previously been interviewed by the Indianapolis Colts in January 2018 and by the New York Jets a year ago, shortly before he penned a contract extension with Baylor.\n\nThe interest in the 44-year-old is unlikely to abate anytime soon, given Rhule led Baylor to an 11-2 record this year for the first time since 2014.\n\nHere's all you need to know ahead of Wednesday.\n\nWhen and where is the Sugar Bowl?\n\nThe Georgia Bulldogs take on the Baylor Bears at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, the home of the New Orleans Saints, in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nKick-off is scheduled for 8:45 p.m. ET on Wednesday, January 1.\n\nTV coverage\n\nThe game will be broadcast nationally on ESPN.\n\nLive stream\n\nA live stream will be available via ESPN's digital platforms, WatchESPN and the ESPN app.\n\nSeries record\n\nGeorgia and Baylor have played each other four times, with the Bulldogs winning on each occasion. The two programs, however, haven't crossed path since 1989.\n\nOdds\n\nAccording to BetOnline, Georgia is a 5.5-point favorite and is 19/20 to cover the spread, while Baylor is a 7/4 underdog.\n\nThe over/under line in terms of total points scored is set at 41.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Ncaa", "college football", "College Football Playoff", "College Football", "NCAA Football"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 16:30:01 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Georgia returns to the Sugar Bowl a year after losing to Texas, while Baylor could clinch a first 12-win season.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://g.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/favicon-96x96.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Sports,College Football,College Football Playoff,NCAA,NCAA Football,Georgia,Baylor", "description": "Georgia returns to the Sugar Bowl a year after losing to Texas, while Baylor could clinch a first 12-win season.", "fb": {"app_id": 245537789135954, "pages": 18343191100}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Newsweek", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/sugar-bowl-georgia-baylor-watch-tv-channel-live-stream-odds-1477687", "title": "Sugar Bowl: How to watch, live stream Georgia vs. Baylor on Wednesday", "description": "Georgia returns to the Sugar Bowl a year after losing to Texas, while Baylor could clinch a first 12-win season.", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1554012/jake-fromm-georgia-bulldogs.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek", "published_time": "2020-01-01T16:30:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T16:30:01-05:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@newsweek", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sugar Bowl: How to watch, live stream Georgia vs. Baylor on Wednesday", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/sugar-bowl-georgia-baylor-watch-tv-channel-live-stream-odds-1477687", "description": "Georgia returns to the Sugar Bowl a year after losing to Texas, while Baylor could clinch a first 12-win season.", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1554012/jake-fromm-georgia-bulldogs.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://g.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://g.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/browserconfig.xml"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.newsweek.com/sugar-bowl-georgia-baylor-watch-tv-channel-live-stream-odds-1477687"}
