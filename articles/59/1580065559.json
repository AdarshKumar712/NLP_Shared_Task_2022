They have tackled the likes of polio and malaria around the world and warned for years about the dangers of infectious diseases.\n\nAddressing a TED Talk five years ago, Gates, 64, warned the next \u2018global catastrophe\u2019 would not be caused by war, but by a virus.\n\nHe said: \u2018If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it\u2019s most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war \u2013 not missiles, but microbes.\u2019\n\n\u2018Part of the reason for this is we have invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents, but we\u2019ve actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not ready for the next epidemic.\u2019\n\nAlthough it turns out that he and his wife were very much ready.\n\nMelinda Gates, Co-Chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, told BBC that her family has been preparing for an outbreak (Credits: Ian Langsdon/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nMelinda Gates told BBC Radio 5Live that her family \u2018had prepared\u2019 for years for a pandemic like coronavirus.\n\n\u2018We had done some preparation, yes. A number of years ago we had talked about what if there isn\u2019t clean water, what if there wasn\u2019t enough food, where might we go, what might we do as a family,\u2019 she explained.\n\n\u2018Absolutely we had prepared and had some food in the basement in case we needed. But now we\u2019re all in the same situation. There are no tools, there was nothing we could do specifically to prepare ourselves with a particular drug or vaccine.\n\n\u2018This is a disease we are all in together and what we mostly talk about now in our home every night is how lucky we are.\u2019\n\nGates went on to say that her family were all wearing masks when out in public.\n\n\u2018When I\u2019m outdoors you bet I am and you bet our kids are as well. I\u2019m certainly seeing it much more in Seattle.\n\n\u2018At the grocery store everybody has a mask on. We might be in that situation for 18 months or 2 years, but ok. Then that\u2019s something new that we adopt.\u2019\n\nBill and Melinda have fought polio and malaria across the world (Villard/Niviere/Sipa/REX)\n\nConsidering Bill has topped the list of wealthiest individuals in the world for years, it\u2019s probably not hard to stockpile a few essentials. But even without Gates\u2019 wealth there are a collective of people known as \u2018preppers\u2019 who make sure they\u2019re ready for any eventuality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe survivalist movement is broad enough to include those who build up provisions for a minor power cut through to those who build nuclear bunkers, stockpile secret weapons and make detailed plans for living beyond the apocalypse.\n\nSuffice to say, they\u2019re probably dealing with the current coronavirus lockdown quite well. Here\u2019s what happened when Metro.co.uk met three UK preppers earlier this year.\n\nMeanwhile, according to Melinda Gates, Germany and South Korea are setting the gold standard for nations in dealing with the pandemic.\n\n\u2018From what we\u2019ve seen about how they\u2019ve conducted tests, how they\u2019ve grouped their swift response, how they\u2019re helping people do this physical distancing and isolation I think they are exemplars for the world,\u2019 she said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Coronavirus", "Bill Gates"], "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "publish_date": "Thu Apr 16 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The billionaire philanthropists knew this was coming", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/m-icon-black.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "google-site-verification": "NRfCb8mBNAy5_f17NpvLZYoY38EzM2dgpcOh_Am9yps", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PRI_149364956.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "title": "Bill and Melinda Gates have been 'prepping' for years for Covid-19", "description": "The billionaire philanthropists knew this was coming", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@MetroUK", "account_id": 138749160}, "ir-site-verification-token": 422605026, "description": "The billionaire philanthropists knew this was coming", "msvalidate.01": "11110DC8D42E74E13F24B3A18E7CFB8A", "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "fb": {"pages": "117118184990145,427889824264313", "app_id": 176908729004638}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/16/bill-melinda-gates-prepping-years-covid-19-12566381/?ia_markup=1"}, "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Metro", "sailthru.date": "2020-04-16 15:47:53", "sailthru.title": "Bill and Melinda Gates have been \u2018prepping\u2019 for years for Covid-19", "sailthru.tags": "bill gates, coronavirus", "sailthru.description": "The billionaire philanthropists knew this was coming", "sailthru.image.full": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PRI_149364956.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=150&h=150&crop=1", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PRI_149364956.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=50&h=150&crop=1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "title": "Bill and Melinda Gates have been 'prepping' for years for Covid-19", "type": "article", "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/16/bill-melinda-gates-prepping-years-covid-19-12566381/", "description": "The billionaire philanthropists knew this was coming", "site_name": "Metro", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PRI_149364956_1587049010.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PRI_149364956_1587049010.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MetroUK", "section": "News", "tag": "Coronavirus", "published_time": "2020-04-16T15:47:53+0000", "modified_time": "2020-04-16T15:56:53+0100"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cropped-m-icon-black-9693.png?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/16/bill-melinda-gates-prepping-years-covid-19-12566381/"}
