We have no way independently of confirming that; but if it is true, then probably that ad, at 113 years, is the longest continuously running advertisement in any American newspaper, ever. And we're sorry to see it go, as will be the readers who have referred to it to learn who in Southeast Portland has passed. However, the funeral home says it intends to continue advertising its periodic special events for which the public is welcome, such as its annual Memorial Day observance.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["socialTag: Sellwood", "Portland", "Oregon", "Sellwood", "Milwaukie", "Oregon", "Portland", "Oregon", "Oregon", "Geography of the United States", "States of the United States", "entities: Foundation Partners", "503 232-2326", "food preparation", "503 234-7989", "she is celebrating its 16th anniversary", "www.AHBoregon.org", "Florida", "Portland", "Portland Memorial", "Memorial Day", "Osmer", "Sheldon Penner", "Kimberly Steele", "7302", "SMILE Station", "Eric", "Changing Places LLC", ""], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Bee"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Business Briefs, Local News, Sellwood local News, Breaking News alerts for Sellwood city.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "socialTag: Sellwood, Portland, Oregon, Sellwood, Milwaukie, Oregon, Portland, Oregon, Oregon, Geography of the United States, States of the United States, entities: Foundation Partners, 503 232-2326, food preparation, 503 234-7989, she is celebrating its 16th anniversary, www.AHBoregon.org, Florida, Portland, Portland Memorial, Memorial Day, Osmer, Sheldon Penner, Kimberly Steele, 7302, SMILE Station, Eric, Changing Places LLC,", "rights": "Pamplin Communications Corporation", "author": "THE BEE", "description": "Business Briefs, Local News, Sellwood local News, Breaking News alerts for Sellwood city.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "fb": {"app_id": 384172401695810}, "og": {"url": "https://pamplinmedia.com/sb/74-news/445907-361060-business-briefs-pwoff", "type": "article", "title": "Business Briefs", "image": "https://pamplinmedia.com/images/artimg/00003658732873-0652.jpg", "site_name": "https://joomlakave.com", "description": "The Business Briefs are short news items about things going on in the Inner Southeast business community"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ThePortlandTrib", "title": "Business Briefs", "description": "The Business Briefs are short news items about things going on in the Inner Southeast business community", "image": "https://pamplinmedia.com/images/artimg/00003658732873-0652.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://pamplinmedia.com/sb/74-news/445907-361060-business-briefs-pwoff"}
