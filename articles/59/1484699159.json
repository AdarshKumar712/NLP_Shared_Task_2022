The shooter fled and the investigation is ongoing, according to Gilbert police.\n\nThe attempt on Boudreaux's life occurred Oct. 2. The Jeep that his would-be killer was driving was registered to Charles Vallow.\n\nVallow died July 11 \u2013 shot to death by his wife's brother while his son Joshua Vallow, 7, and his half-sister, Tylee Ryan, 17, watched.\n\nBoudreaux believes Charles' death, the children's disappearance and his attempted murder are connected to a religious group that the children's mother, Lori Vallow, joined about 18 months ago.\n\n\"I just don't know how people can get so wrapped up that they can end up in this space where these people are. It's just so radical, so different,\" Boudreaux said.\n\nAre Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow in a cult-like religious group?\n\nBoudreaux's ex-wife, Melani Boudreaux, is Lori's niece. She began spending time with Lori and the religious group and suddenly demanded a divorce over the summer, Brandon Boudreaux said.\n\n\"I thought I had a happy marriage, so it was pretty overwhelming,\" Brandon said.\n\nBefore the divorce was final, someone driving Charles Vallow's vehicle attempted to kill him, Brandon said.\n\nBrandon was about to pull into his driveway when he saw a gun with a silencer poke out of the Jeep's window, he said. He heard a gunshot as his driver's side window shattered.\n\nPolice later confirmed that the vehicle was registered to Charles Vallow.\n\nCharles Vallow was Lori's ex-husband. She divorced him, joined the religious group and married Chad Daybell weeks after Daybell's wife died suddenly at 49.\n\nOver the summer, Charles Vallow came from Texas to visit Lori Vallow and their children. But after he arrived to pick up his son, Charles and Lori Vallow started arguing.\n\nLori Vallow's brother, Alex Cox, intervened and killed Charles, police said at the time.\n\nOngoing investigation: 2 missing Idaho kids are in danger and mom 'completely refused' to help find them\n\nThe investigation into Charles' death is ongoing, Detective Seth Tyler of the Chandler Police Department said last week.\n\nOn Dec. 12, Cox himself died. The cause of death is unknown at this time, Gilbert Police Officer Dani Covey told The Arizona Republic, which is part of the USA TODAY Network. The investigation is pending the results of an autopsy, which could take a few weeks or months, Covey said.\n\nJoshua Vallow and Tylee Ryan were at home when Charles Vallow was killed.\n\nIt was shortly after Charles Vallow's death that relatives stopped hearing from Tylee and Joshua. The children were last seen on Sept. 23 in Rexburg, Idaho.\n\nRexburg police are investigating the disappearance of the children, with the assistance of the FBI. Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell are not cooperating with police.\n\nIn social media posts and media interviews, family and friends of the couple have described the couple's religious beliefs as cult-like and troubling, saying they spoke frequently of the end of the world.\n\nSean Bartholick, an Idaho-based attorney for Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell, issued a statement to some media outlets saying Chad Daybell was a \"loving husband and has the support of his children in this matter.\"\n\n\"Lori Daybell is a devoted mother and resents assertions to the contrary,\" the statement said, as reported by the East Idaho News. \"We look forward to addressing the allegations once they have moved beyond speculation and rumor.\u201d\n\nBrandon Boudreaux is now living in hiding outside of Arizona\n\nAfter his attempted murder, Brandon Boudreaux asked the court for full custody of his four children and requested Melani not see the children without supervision.\n\n\"The agents investigating (the shooting) have indicated to (Brandon) that they have concerns over the children's safety if they remain in the care of mother unsupervised,\" Brandon's attorney wrote in a court filing.\n\nIn that filing, Brandon's attorney expressed his concerns about Melani's relationship with her aunt, Lori Vallow. Melani frequently spent time with Lori and took their children to her home, according to the filing.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jessica Boehm", "Arizona Republic"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 14:56:03 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Around the time Idaho siblings Joshua Vallow and Tylee Ryan disappeared, one of their relatives was targeted in a shooting near Phoenix.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooNews", "player": {"identifier": "https://news.yahoo.com/two-missing-children-could-linked-124744239.html?format=embed", "height": 281, "width": 500}, "card": "player", "description": "Around the time Idaho siblings Joshua Vallow and Tylee Ryan disappeared, one of their relatives was targeted in a shooting near Phoenix.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x9DRczvqveoq3leGfzkzxA--~B/aD05NjA7dz05NjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/24affb95-0998-4708-a559-f82f4f652685/0f6e96fb-3144-58b2-8167-afc37b84aca1/data_3_0.jpg?s=21789afbd673b4ab7831cd275241a442&c=c8d21e043ce2ae2956fb0a519eb7e0a4&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x9DRczvqveoq3leGfzkzxA--~B/aD05NjA7dz05NjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/24affb95-0998-4708-a559-f82f4f652685/0f6e96fb-3144-58b2-8167-afc37b84aca1/data_3_0.jpg?s=21789afbd673b4ab7831cd275241a442&c=c8d21e043ce2ae2956fb0a519eb7e0a4&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0"}, "title": "Cult connections?
