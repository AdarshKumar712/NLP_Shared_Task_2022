Wayne Lukas.\n\n\n\nBreezing over a fast, sealed surface, Calumet Farm's Bravazo\u2019s time of 1:01 was the fastest of 12 works recorded at the distance. The move represented the second published work for Bravazo since finishing eighth in his comeback race, the Clark Stakes (G1) Nov. 29 at Churchill Downs.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood work yesterday,\u201d Lukas said Tuesday morning. \u201cReal good. I thought the track was a little bit sticky, yet he still went in a minute. That was good.\u201d\n\n\n\nLukas said he should confirm a rider for Bravazo later Tuesday, adding the colt is scheduled to work three more times at Oaklawn before shipping to south Florida on Jan. 20.\n\n\n\nBravazo, in his 4-year-old debut, finished fourth in the 2019 Pegasus World Cup before being sidelined following surgery to remove a bone chip from a knee. In his first work following the Clark, Bravazo covered five furlongs in 1:01.40 on Dec. 23.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right on target, barring any unforeseen setbacks,\u201d Lukas said.\n\n\n\nLukas said the 1 1/8-mile Pegasus World Cup is the start of an ambitious three-race global campaign for Bravazo, who was among the country\u2019s leading 3-year-olds in 2018.\n\n\n\nFollowing the Pegasus World Cup, Lukas said Bravazo is scheduled to compete in the inaugural $20 million Saudi Cup \u2013 the world\u2019s richest race \u2013 Feb. 29 in Saudi Arabia and the $12 million Dubai World Cup (G1) March 28 in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our plan,\u201d Lukas said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s plan. I hear these guys saying, \u2018Well, they think they\u2019re waiting for Saudi and not run in the Pegasus.\u2019 To hell with that, I\u2019m running in all three of them. I think he thrives on work. If I don\u2019t do that, seriously, we\u2019d put probably four or five more works into him. That\u2019s probably as shaky as anything.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn 2018, Bravazo won an entry-level allowance race at Oaklawn and the $400,000 Risen Star Stakes (G2) at Fair Grounds before finishing second in the Preakness at Pimlico and $1 million Haskell Invitational Stakes (G1) at Monmouth Park and third in the $1.25 million Travers Stakes (G1) at Saratoga and $1 million Breeders\u2019 Cup Dirt Mile (G1) at Churchill Downs.\n\n\n\nBravazo has 3-4-3 record from 18 lifetime starts and earnings of $2,009,528.\n\n\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["bravazo horse", "pegasus world cup 2020"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Horse Racing news: Pegasus World Cup starts Bravazo's aspiring 2020 season.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.horseracingnation.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Bravazo's pointed toward each of the Pegasus World Cup, Saudi Arabia and Dubai.", "title": "Pegasus World Cup starts Bravazo's aspiring 2020 season", "site": "@hr_nation", "image": "https://184cda7661b9609f94b0-f196c43f59505ef65734afae659eea38.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/Bravazo_horse_615x400_orig.jpg", "creator": "@hr_nation"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1460007255", "keywords": "bravazo horse, pegasus world cup 2020", "description": "Horse Racing news: Pegasus World Cup starts Bravazo's aspiring 2020 season."}, "canonical_link": ""}
