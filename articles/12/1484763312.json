But when the present was opened by the little girl, a weird, creepy looking doll was found instead.\n\nThe poor child was so terrified that she did not want to even touch the scaled skin, green-haired doll, which was named Pearl.\n\nLater, when the doll was sent for repair to a \u2018doll and teddy bear hospital\u2019 in Secaucus, New Jersey, 56 grams of cocaine was found stuffed inside it, Metro reported.\n\nIn no time the mother found herself in a strange conversation with a detective, who interrogated her about the way she had acquired the doll. She was asked if she had inherited the doll from some uncle, who had stuffed drugs in it 30 years ago.\n\nHer plight did not end here as she was further probed on why she chose to get her daughter a doll from online store instead of simply buying doll Ariel from The Little Mermaid.\n\nElizabeth had shared her unfortunate incident on Facebook with the picture of Pearl. In her account, she said that since Ellie had asked for a baby mermaid doll, she could not possibly purchase Ariel which is a grown up version of a mermaid.\n\nThe entire family\u2019s background was checked to find out whether the drugs belonged to Elizabeth.\n\nEventually, the family was let off the hook. The police carried out a sting on the doll maker in Alabama and an international drug trial is awaited.\n\nElizabeth\u2019s post recounting this plight, has 29000 shares so far.\n\nGet the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.
