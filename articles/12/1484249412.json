According to the Save the Manatee Club, 130 manatees were killed by boats last year.\n\nHere are some do's and don'ts when it comes to boating with manatees:\n\nHot spots: According to researchers, Lee County had the highest number of manatee deaths in 2019 due to boats, with 25 manatees killed. Brevard County was close behind with 15, followed by Volusia County with 12.\n\nHabitat loss: Researchers think habitat loss and seagrass loss could be partially to blame. \u201cThey are migrating into new areas that they might not be as familiar with, and boaters might not be as familiar with seeing manatees in those areas, which can then lead to more collisions between manatees and boaters,\u201d Save the Manatee Club researcher Cora Berchem tells us.\n\nReasons for boat hits: Berchem thinks more boaters on the water and manatees being taken off the Endangered Species List are factors in the rise of manatee deaths.\n\nPrevention: To prevent the record from being broken again in 2020, Berchem suggests that boaters drive slowly, wear polarized sunglasses, and look for manatee snouts and \"footprints.\" \u201cA 'footprint' is a circular pattern on the top of the water that the manatee will make when it swims, so if you see a 'footprint' or a manatee snout coming up for air, that is a good indication that there are manatees in the area,\u201d Berchem says.\n\nWhat to do: If you do accidentally strike a manatee while boating, or you see a sick or injured manatee, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission urges you report it to its 24-hour hotline at 1-888-404-3922. FWC will dispatch someone out to the animal to help.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Animals", "Orlando", "Florida", "Tampa", "Nicole Griffin", "News", "Volusia County", "Local"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Published Pm Et Jan."], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "According to the Save the Manatee Club, 130 manatees were killed by boats last year.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": null, "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "According to the Save the Manatee Club, 130 manatees were killed by boats last year.", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "HTML5,Flash", "PreferredFormats": "MPEG4"}, "robots": "noodp, noydir", "googlebot": "index, follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=740948885", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.twcable.twcnews", "keywords": "Animals, Orlando, Florida, Tampa, Nicole Griffin, News, Volusia County, Local", "news_keywords": "Animals, Orlando, Florida, Tampa, Nicole Griffin, News, Volusia County, Local", "og": {"title": "Here's Why a Record Number of Manatees Were Killed by Boats in 2019", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.mynews13.com/fl/orlando/news/2020/01/01/florida-manatees-2019-boat-deaths", "description": "Save the Manatee Club: 130 animals killed by boats last year", "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/0101_n13_manatee_boat_strike_generic_file_NEW"}, "twitter": {"title": "Here's Why a Record Number of Manatees Were Killed by Boats in 2019", "description": "Save the Manatee Club: 130 animals killed by boats last year", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.mynews13.com/fl/orlando/news/2020/01/01/florida-manatees-2019-boat-deaths", "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/0101_n13_manatee_boat_strike_generic_file_NEW"}, "story": {"headline": "Here's Why a Record Number of Manatees Were Killed by Boats in 2019", "description": "According to the Save the Manatee Club, 130 manatees were killed by boats last year."}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.mynews13.com/fl/orlando/news/2020/01/01/florida-manatees-2019-boat-deaths"}
