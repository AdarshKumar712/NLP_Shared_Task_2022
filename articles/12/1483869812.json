This movie tells the story of three women at Fox News, played by Margot Robbie, Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman, who set out to expose him for sexual harassment.\n\n17 January\n\nA much acclaimed portrait of an African-American family in Florida trying to stay together. Kelvin Harrison Jr plays Tyler, a teenager struggling under the fierce expectations of his demanding father, played by Sterling K Brown, while pursuing a relationship with Emily, a girl in his class played by Alexa Demi. The ensemble playing has been praised, as has the bold non-linear storytelling style.\n\n17 January\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Suited and booted \u2026 Dev Patel in The Personal History of David Copperfield. Photograph: Allstar\n\nArmando Iannucci brings his masterly satirical touch to this classic, working with co-writer Simon Blackwell and bringing in a diverse cast headed by Dev Patel to tap into Charles Dickens\u2019 humanity, optimism and fun.\n\n24 January\n\nTom Hanks stars in this heartwarmer about the children\u2019s TV star Fred Rogers \u2013 a legend in the US, though little known in the UK \u2013 who presented an afternoon show called Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood and was America\u2019s answer to John Noakes, John Craven and Tony Hart all rolled into one.\n\n31 January\n\nFor the followup to his much-admired chiller The Witch, Robert Eggers delivers a brutal, gripping nightmare. Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson give sledgehammer performances as two lighthouse-keepers on a remote island going slowly and then quickly mad.\n\n31 January\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Predators \u2026 Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Parasite. Photograph: 2019 CJ ENM Corporation, Barunson E&A\n\nSouth Korean film-maker Bong Joon-ho won the Cannes Palme d\u2019Or for this satirical gem. It\u2019s an invasion of the lifestyle snatchers about a wealthy family who hire live-in servants without realising that they are all one family, a cuckoo-in-the-nest gang of predators planning to take over.\n\n7 February\n\nA superbly elegant, enigmatic period drama from French film-maker C\u00e9line Sciamma. Ad\u00e8le Haenel plays an 18th-century young noblewoman whose mother hires her a \u201ccompanion\u201d, Marianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant), without revealing that she is an artist who has been commissioned to paint a secret portrait of her young mistress. A tense relationship develops.\n\n28 February\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sensation \u2026 The Perfect Candidate. Photograph: Razor Film\n\nSaudi film-maker Haifaa al-Mansour comes from a country in which there are very few women working in cinema \u2013 or anywhere \u2013 so this is a personal project for her. It\u2019s the story of a female doctor who causes a sensation by making a successful run for office in the local municipal elections.\n\n13 March\n\nDaniel Craig hangs up his Beretta, his tux and sky-blue swimming briefs and bows out as Bond. Veteran 007 screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have teamed up with Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge for what is purportedly a funny, savvy last hurrah for Craig.\n\n3 April\n\nScreenwriters Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson and director Sarah Gavron team up to create a joyful film: a social realist adventure about a bunch of Year 11 girls at an east London secondary school. Newcomer Bukky Bakray is a Nigerian-British girl who has to look after her kid brother when her mum goes awol. There\u2019s a rush of energy and creativity in this film.\n\n24 April\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Taking centre stage \u2026 Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow. Photograph: Marvel Studios\n\nCate Shortland, who made the great Australian film Somersault, takes the helm of this superhero movie, in which Black Widow from Avengers takes centre stage. Scarlett Johansson returns in the title role.\n\n1 May\n\nPossibly the strangest film of the year, from French film-maker, musician and DJ Quentin Dupieux, AKA Mr Oizo. Jean Dujardin stars as a serial killer who is obsessed with his vintage 60s deerskin jacket.\n\n8 May\n\nWonder Woman 1984\n\nThis is another superheroine instalment in the DC Extended Universe, and features Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman in the 1980s who comes up against a new foe: Cheetah, an evil British archaeologist played by Kristen Wiig.\n\n5 June\n\nWhoever it is you were gonna call, you\u2019d better call \u2019em again. This new Ghostbusters returns to the classic all-male template, in effect a sequel to Ghostbusters 2, with such veterans as Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver reprising their roles and Jason (son of Ivan) Reitman directing.\n\n10 July\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Back on the bike \u2026 Tom Cruise in Top Gun: Maverick. Photograph: YouTube\n\nStill speedy, still needy, still eerily boyish, Captain Pete \u201cMaverick\u201d Mitchell returns \u2013 the US Navy pilot played by Tom Cruise who could be piloting a desk by now but is still a badass warrior of the skies. Jennifer Connelly is now Tom\u2019s love interest, a mere nine years his junior.\n\n17 July\n\nLast Night in Soho\n\nOne of Britain\u2019s brightest movie talents Edgar Wright returns with a psychological London horror avowedly in the classic style of Nicolas Roeg, set in the glamorous and seedy world of swinging 60s London and co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns (who also co-scripted 1917).\n\n18 September\n\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nRenowned screenwriter and director Aaron Sorkin has created a comic crime thriller based around the story of the Chicago Seven \u2014 the counterculture protesters charged with conspiracy to riot. Sorkin is famed for his machine-gun dialogue, so a fast-talking defence of the seven could be on offer.\n\n25 September\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mean streets \u2026 Michael Gandolfini, right, on set filming The Many Saints of Newark. Photograph: Startraks Photo/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nDavid Chase has co-written a movie follow-up to his iconic HBO series The Sopranos, featuring Michael Gandolfini as the young Tony Soprano \u2013 Michael being the son of the late James Gandolfini who played the New Jersey crime boss on the small screen. But who will play the ruthless matriarch Livia?\n\n25 September\n\nChlo\u00e9 Zhao is the film-maker lauded for her tough docu-realist picture The Rider. This couldn\u2019t be more different. It\u2019s a Marvel superhero film about a mighty race of aliens, featuring Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden and Gemma Chan.\n\n6 November\n\nAnother adaptation of the classic sci-fi novel by Frank Herbert. It takes some chutzpah to take on a story last adapted by David Lynch, but this is what Denis Villeneuve has done \u2013 having already shown he has the sci-fi chops with his films Arrival and Blade Runner 2049. Oscar Isaac, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson star.\n\n20 November\n\nWest Side Story\n\nSteven Spielberg takes on the classic with its immortal Leonard Bernstein score \u2026 but will it follow the Broadway revival in dropping the song I Feel Pretty? Ansel Elgort and Rachel Zegler are the star-crossed lovers Tony and Maria.\n\n18 December\n\nNews of the World\n\nPaul Greengrass\u2019s latest film is based on the western novel by Paulette Jiles about a young girl returning to her family in 1860s Texas after being kidnapped by the Kiowa tribe. Helena Zengel plays the girl, Johanna, and Tom Hanks plays the man who must look after her: Captain Kidd, an army veteran who makes a living reading newspapers to illiterate townsfolk and who is now in the middle of a very big news story.\n\n25 December\n\nAntebellum\n\nGerard Bush and Christopher Renz make their feature debut with this much-hyped new supernatural horror starring Janelle Mon\u00e1e, with a story set both in a slave plantation and also in the present day. It\u2019s a satirical chiller which could be in the same vein as Get Out.\n\nSpring\n\nAn intriguingly Fowlesian story is on offer from writer-director Francis Lee (the author of God\u2019s Own Country): in Victorian Britain, Mary Anning (Kate Winslet) is a geologist and fossil hunter who has fallen on hard times and when a rich tourist asks her to look after his wife (Saoirse Ronan), a complex relationship ensues.\n\nTo be confirmed\n\nIt has to be one of the film world\u2019s most unusual sequels, as well as one of the quickest to follow its original. Joanna Hogg has delivered a followup to her hugely admired autobiographical film about a young woman who wants to be a film-maker and falls into a destructive relationship. Honor Swinton Byrne and Tilda Swinton reprise their original roles.\n\nTo be confirmed\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Found in La Mancha \u2026 Adam Driver and Jonathan Pryce in The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. Photograph: Allstar/Amazon Studios\n\nFor three decades, Terry Gilliam\u2019s epically delayed attempt to make a film version of Don Quixote has been one of the great what-ifs and whens of film history, an ordeal of bad luck, wrecked sets and lost funding that has outlived two of the actors cast: John Hurt and Jean Rochefort. Now it is finally made, with Jonathan Pryce in the lead.\n\nTo be confirmed\n\nAnnette\n\nThe wild man of French cinema is back. Leos Carax (who made the freaky Holy Motors, with Denis Lavant and Kylie Minogue) has now attempted a musical, starring Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard as a comedian and singer whose daughter has a special gift. Tunes come from the 70s band Sparks.\n\nTo be confirmed\n\nLet Them All Talk\n\nMeryl Streep stars as a celebrated author in this film from Steven Soderbergh who takes a journey down memory lane with some old friends; Lucas Hedges is the nephew who gets involved with a literary agent played by Gemma Chan.\n\nTo be confirmed\n\nFestival audiences have been traumatised by this harrowing, three-hour black-and-white movie from Czech director V\u00e1clav Marhoul, based on the 1965 Jerzy Kosinski novel about the horrors of war-torn eastern Europe. Not for the faint-hearted.\n\nTo be confirmed\n\nGaby Chiappe and Rebecca Frayn are the screenwriters for this comedy about the 1970 Miss World competition in which Miss Grenada (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) won and, under controversial and chaotic circumstances, became the first black winner. Greg Kinnear plays the host, Bob Hope, horrified by a flour-throwing protest from feminist campaigners.\n\nTo be confirmed\n\nSupernova\n\nStanley Tucci and Colin Firth star as Tusker and Sam, life partners travelling across Britain in a camper van to see old friends and family members, their quest made bittersweet by the fact that one has early onset dementia.\n\nTo be confirmed", "keywords":
