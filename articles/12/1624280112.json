Data from the two studies in the DISCOVER programme formed the basis of the validated filing on 11 October 2019 to the EMA in the European Union (EU) for approval of guselkumab for the treatment of adult patients with active PsAand primary endpoint results were recently published in The Lancet.3,4,5\n\n\"Those who are living with active psoriatic arthritis are faced with debilitating symptoms and inflammation which may ultimately lead to irreversible damage to the joints,\" said Christopher Ritchlin, M.D., M.P.H., Chief of the Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology and Director of the Clinical Immunology Research Center at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester, New York and lead investigator of the DISCOVER-1 study. \"Findings from the DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2 studies are encouraging for patients and physicians alike who may be seeking new treatment options that utilise mechanisms of action different to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha biologics to combat the multi-faceted combination of symptoms presented by psoriatic arthritis.\"\n\nDISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2 evaluated the efficacy and safety of guselkumab compared to placebo. DISCOVER-1 included patients who were biologic-na\u00efve or had previously been exposed to anti-TNF alpha biologics. DISCOVER-2 included patients who were biologic-na\u00efve only; it also assessed radiographic progression of joint damage. In both studies, patients were randomised to guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks (q4w) or every 8 weeks (q8w) for one year, or to placebo with crossover to guselkumab q4w at week 24 through one year. These findings are being presented as poster tours (SAT0397/SAT0402) at this year's European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) E-Congress, at which Janssen is sharing data in a total of 32 abstracts.1,2\n\nIn both studies, American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates at week 52 included non-responder imputation (NRI) data, which categorised patients who discontinued the study as non-responders from week 24 to 52.\n\nIn DISCOVER-1, data demonstrated that at week 52:1\n\n73 percent of guselkumab q4w patients and 60 percent of guselkumab q8w patients achieved ACR20; 54 percent of guselkumab q4w patients and 39 percent of guselkumab q8w patients achieved ACR50 (NRI).\n\nAmong patients who had clinically relevant psoriasis at baseline, 83 percent of guselkumab q4w patients, 69 percent of guselkumab q8w patients and 82 percent of patients who crossed over from placebo to guselkumab q4w achieved clear or almost clear skin with at least a 2 grade improvement from baseline as measured by the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score (observed data).a\n\nIn DISCOVER-2, data demonstrated that at week 52:2\n\n71 percent of guselkumab q4w patients and 75 percent of guselkumab q8w patients achieved ACR20; 46 percent of guselkumab q4w patients and 48 percent of guselkumab q8w patients achieved ACR50 (NRI).\n\nAmong patients who had clinically relevant psoriasis at baseline, 84 percent of guselkumab q4w patients, 77 percent of guselkumab q8w patients and 84 percent of patients who crossed over from placebo to guselkumab q4w achieved clear or almost clear skin with at least a 2 grade improvement from baseline as measured by the IGA score (observed data).a\n\nGuselkumab q4w and q8w demonstrated sustained improvements in inhibition of radiographic progressionb of joint structural damage through week 52 (observed data).\n\nThe DISCOVER studies also showed improvements in multiple secondary endpoints at week 52 compared with week 24,1,2 including ACR70 response, resolution of soft tissue inflammation (enthesitis and dactylitis)c,d, disease activity score (DAS-28) (C-Reactive Protein [CRP])e (minimal disease activity [MDA])f (very low disease activity [VLDA])g, improvement in physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index [HAQ-DI])h, general health outcomes (SF-36 Physical Component Summary [PCS] and Mental Component Summary [MCS]).i,j,k\n\nIn both studies, guselkumab was well-tolerated through study completion, and observed adverse events (AEs) were generally consistent with previous studies of guselkumab and current prescribing information.6 Serious AEs and serious infections occurred in 4 percent and 1 percent of guselkumab-treated patients, respectively, in both DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2. There were no reported deaths in guselkumab-treated patients and no guselkumab-treated patient had inflammatory bowel disease, opportunistic infections, active tuberculosis or anaphylactic or serum sickness-like reactions.1,2\n\n\"Efficacy of guselkumab in psoriatic arthritis was previously demonstrated to be superior to placebo at week 24. These new data show that efficacy is maintained to week 52 with safety data that are consistent with the well-established profile of guselkumab in psoriasis,\" said Alyssa Johnsen, M.D., Ph.D., Vice President, Rheumatology Disease Area Leader, Janssen Research Development, LLC. \"We are excited to share the data on guselkumab in psoriatic arthritis as we continue to advance our research in this disease and bring more treatment options to psoriatic arthritis patients in need.\"\n\nIn a separate study, data from DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2 were analysed as part of a network meta-analysis that compared the efficacy and safety of guselkumab to other targeted biologic therapies for PsA. Twenty-six Phase 3 studies were included comparing the impact of 13 targeted therapies for PsA on ACR 20/50/70 response, Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 75/90/100 response, HAQ-DI score, resolution of enthesitis, resolution of dactylitis, AEs and serious AEs. The analysis is being shared as an abstract (Abstract AB0820) during the EULAR E-Congress.7\n\nENDS\n\nDr Christopher Ritchlin is a paid consultant for Janssen.

DISCOVER-1 evaluated 381 participants and continued through approximately one year.4\n\nThe study consisted of a screening phase of up to six weeks, a blinded treatment phase of 52 weeks that includes a placebo-controlled period from week 0 to week 24 and an active treatment period from week 24 to week 52. It also includes a safety follow-up phase of eight weeks after week 52 (week 52 to 60; 12 weeks from the last administration of study agent [at week 48] through to the final visit in the safety follow-up phase). Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity and biomarker evaluations were performed in the study on a defined schedule.\n\nAbout DISCOVER-2 (NCT03158285)12\n\nDISCOVER-2 is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of guselkumab administered by SC injection in subjects with active psoriatic arthritis. DISCOVER-2 is evaluating 739 participants and continuing through approximately two years.5\n\nThe study consists of a screening phase of up to six weeks, a blinded treatment phase (approximately 100 weeks) that includes a placebo-controlled period from week 0 to week 24 and an active treatment period from week 24 to week 100. It also includes a safety follow-up phase of 12 weeks after the last administration of study agent. Efficacy, health economics, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, biomarker and pharmacogenomics evaluations are being performed in the study on a defined schedule.\n\nAbout Psoriatic Arthritis\n\nPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterised by peripheral joint inflammation, enthesitis, dactylitis, axial disease and the skin lesions associated with psoriasis.13 Studies show that up to 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop PsA.14 The disease causes pain, stiffness and swelling in and around the joints; it commonly appears between the ages of 30 and 50, but can develop at any time.14,15 Though the exact cause of PsA is unknown, genes, the immune system and environmental factors are all believed to play a role in the onset of the disease.15\n\nAbout TREMFYA(guselkumab)6\n\nDeveloped by Janssen, guselkumab is the first approved monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. Guselkumab is approved as a prescription medicine in the EU, U.S., Canada, Japan and a number of other countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet [UV] light). It is approved as a prescription medicine in Japan and Brazil for the treatment of adult patients with active PsA. IL-23 is an important driver of the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and PsA.16 In psoriasis, guselkumab is administered as a 100 mg SC injection once every 8 weeks, after starter doses at weeks 0 and 4.\n\nThe Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson Johnson maintain exclusive worldwide marketing rights to TREMFYA\n\nImportant Safety Information\n\nVery common (>10%) and common AEs (>1%) in controlled periods of clinical studies with guselkumab were upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, herpes simplex infections, tinea infections, headache, diarrhoea, urticaria, arthralgia and injection site erythema. Most were considered to be mild and did not necessitate discontinuation of study treatment.\n\nPlease refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for full prescribing information for guselkumab: https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/34321\n\nAEs should be reported.
