It is inaccurate and preposterous.\n\nOur statements have been consistent with our understanding of climate science.\n\nRather than pursuing solutions to address the risk of climate change, these activists, along with trial lawyers, have acknowledged a goal of extracting money from our shareholders and attacking the company\u2019s reputation.\n\nThey have admitted their earlier allegations that the company hid its climate science research were wrong and have now shifted to a new thesis in their campaign against the company.\n\nExxonMobil is focused on providing the energy the world needs and developing solutions to address the risk of climate change by reducing our emissions, helping consumers reduce their emissions and conducting research into new low-emissions technologies. We support the Paris climate agreement and are members of the Climate Leadership Council, which advocates for a revenue-neutral carbon tax.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "ExxonMobil issued the following statement today regarding the release of a study, Assessing ExxonMobil\u2019s climate change communications (1977\u20132014), by Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/-/media/Global/Icons/XX-favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "ExxonMobil issued the following statement today regarding the release of a study, Assessing ExxonMobil\u2019s climate change communications (1977\u20132014), by Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes.", "og": {"title": "ExxonMobil statement on inaccurate, activist-funded climate communications study", "url": "https://corporate.exxonmobil.com:443/News/Newsroom/News-releases/Statements/Statement-on-study", "description": "ExxonMobil issued the following statement today regarding the release of a study, Assessing ExxonMobil\u2019s climate change communications (1977\u20132014), by Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes.", "site_name": "ExxonMobil", "type": "Website"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@exxonmobil", "creator": "@exxonmobil", "title": "ExxonMobil statement on inaccurate, activist-funded climate communications study", "description": "ExxonMobil issued the following statement today regarding the release of a study, Assessing ExxonMobil\u2019s climate change communications (1977\u20132014), by Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes."}}, "canonical_link": "https://corporate.exxonmobil.com:443/news/newsroom/news-releases/statements/statement-on-study"}
