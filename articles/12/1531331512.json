Then, despite this act being filmed, and with many producers, \u2018experts\u2019 and crew knowing what happened, Hayley then uses said pooey toothbrush for a rumoured five days with absolutely no one stepping in to stop her.\n\nThe whole debacle is gross, humiliating and unethical, but this should not come as a surprise.

This groundbreaking social experiment uses science and psychology to help Australian singles meet their perfect partner.\u201d\n\nThere are many problems with this, namely that no one on the show is there to find love and the so-called \u2018science\u2019 is\u2026 flawed.\n\nANYWAY.\n\nI don\u2019t want to brush my teeth with a pooey toothbrush but\u2026 curiosity got the better of me. I also fancy myself throwing a fruit bowl or two.\n\nSo look. I applied. Yes, I\u2019m ashamed, embarrassed, scared etc.\n\nIf you\u2019re also thinking about it (why?) and wonder what it takes to build a profile that will hopefully lead you to teeth whitening endorsement deals and at least one trip to the Logies red carpet, here\u2019s what to expect from the application process.\n\nTo complete the rest of the application, you must agree to sell your soul, both your kidneys and guardianship of your firstborn child by answering a series of invasive questions:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["reality-tv-2", "mafs", "MAFS hub page", "married-at-first-sight", "news-stories", "The Twins recaps", "mafs2020", "entertainment-3", "MAFS 2020"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Feb 26 16:11:35 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Nine have opened MAFS application 2021 for Married At First Sight Australia 2021 season.
