It can be hard when you\u2019re lonely so I\u2019ve looked for things to study. I\u2019m reading a lot more than I ever did before. I\u2019m not sure I ever opened a book at home.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve turned into a man. I was in a comfort zone living in England. I was happy being around my family and my friends, going out to Nandos, the normal things you do.\n\n\u2018Over in Holland it was up to me to find a different routine, doing different things, like taking myself for walks. I\u2019ve got used to my own company a lot more but I\u2019d say I\u2019m mentally stronger for that. I think my family have seen me grow into a different person in the last year.\u2019\n\nMORE: Takumi Minamino unable to make Liverpool debut against Sheffield United\n\nMORE: Why referee and VAR did not give Virgil van Dijk handball in Liverpool vs Wolves", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Jurgen Klopp", "Transfer News and Rumours", "Premier League", "Liverpool FC", "Liverpool Transfer News"], "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Liverpool are weighing up a move for Vitesse left-back Max Clark as cover for Andy Robertson.
