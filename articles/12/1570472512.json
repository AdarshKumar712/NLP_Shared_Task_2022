He wore a black fur hat and leather coat but was not wearing a face mask, though other military officials had black masks in an apparent reflection of the country\u2019s campaign against the coronavirus.\n\nAnalysts have speculated North Korea reduced training and other activities with large troop gatherings to reduce the chance of the virus spreading in its military. North Korea has not revealed if it has any cases of the illness, though state media has hinted at some people being quarantined while showing symptoms.\n\nKCNA said of the drill that North Korean troops \u201cproudly demonstrated\u201d accurate marksmanship with their long-range artillery pieces, but it didn\u2019t further specify the weapons involved.\n\n\u201c(Kim) expressed great satisfaction with the fact that the artillerymen are prepared to make rapid reaction to any circumstances and perfectly carry out their firepower combat duties,\u201d the agency said.\n\n\u201cSaying that the victory of the socialist cause is guaranteed by the powerful military force and a war deterrence, he said that the People\u2019s Army should keep full combat-readiness to protect the sky, land and sea of the country from any encroachment.\u201d\n\nThe report did not mention any direct comments by Kim toward the United States or South Korea.\n\nKim Dong-yub, an analyst from Seoul\u2019s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the weapons involved would have included a \u201csuper large\u201d multiple rocket launcher the North first revealed last year, judging by the flight data announced by Seoul\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nSince the collapse of a second summit last year between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump, North Korea resumed ballistic activity and weapons launches to expand its military capabilities. Kim had entered the new year vowing to bolster his nuclear deterrent in the face of \u201cgangster-like\u201d U.S. sanctions and pressure.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Canada", "Space", "Agriculture", "China", "Cartoon Carousel", "Cybersecurity", "Employment & Immigration", "Education", "Coronavirus", "Defense"], "authors": ["Lara Seligman"], "publish_date": "Mon Mar  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.politico.com/cf/05/ee684a274496b04fa20ba2978da1/politico.png", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "og": {"title": "Masked officers join Kim Jong Un at military drill", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/02/north-korea-kim-military-drill-119320", "description": "North Korea has a live-fire rocket artillery exercise.", "image": "https://static.politico.com/6a/a3/f7d4a827490b9980d7972fa72f21/200302-kju-ap-773.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "site_name": "POLITICO"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#dc0228", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "twitter": {"title": "Masked officers join Kim Jong Un at military drill", "image": "https://static.politico.com/6a/a3/f7d4a827490b9980d7972fa72f21/200302-kju-ap-773.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@politico", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "build": "hotfix/cge-croatia-3 45af427 2020-03-02T17:10:28Z"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/02/north-korea-kim-military-drill-119320"}
