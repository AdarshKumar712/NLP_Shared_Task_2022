A photo taken by graduates of a West Virginia prison training course doing the Nazi salute. Share\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\n(JTA) \u2014 More than 30 West Virginia correctional academy trainees who were seen giving a Nazi salute in a class photo will be fired.\n\nWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Monday that he has approved the recommendations from a report by state investigators calling for the dismissal of the correctional officer trainees who participated in the photo. According to the report, the trainees regularly gave the Nazi salute \u201cas a sign of respect\u201d for their instructor in the weeks prior to the release of the photo, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe photo of dozens of participants in the basic training class making the Nazi salute reads \u201cHail Byrd!\u201d at the top, a reference to their correctional academy instructor, Karrie Byrd.\n\nTwo correctional academy trainers and a cadet from the class shown in the picture were fired when the photo came to light in early December.\n\nByrd told investigators that she was unaware of the \u201chistorical or racial implications of the gesture\u201d and said it was \u201csimply a greeting,\u201d according to the report, NBC News reported. Other sources for the report contradicted her statements.\n\n\u201cThe investigation disclosed that she encouraged it, reveled in it, and at times reciprocated the gesture,\u201d the report said.\n\nJustice said in a statement Monday that \u201cthis act needed to result in real consequences \u2013 terminations and dismissals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis kind of behavior will not be tolerated on my watch in any agency of state government,\u201d he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Shiva Guide", "Events"], "authors": ["Marcy Oster", "Office Of The Governor Of..."], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "More than 30 West Virginia correctional academy trainees who were seen giving a Nazi salute in a class photo will be fired.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://forward.com/apple-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"description": "More than 30 West Virginia correctional academy trainees who were seen giving a Nazi salute in a class photo will be fired.", "og": {"site_name": "The Forward", "title": "Over 30 West Virginia Prison Guard Trainees Fired Over Nazi Salute Photo", "type": "article", "url": "https://forward.com/fast-forward/437493/west-virginia-prison-nazi-salute-photo/", "image": "https://images.forwardcdn.com/image/1090x480/center/images/cropped/eldeq7zwsae3iim-1575579790.jpeg", "description": "The trainees regularly gave the Nazi salute \u201cas a sign of respect\u201d for their instructor, a report by state investigators found."}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.forwardcdn.com/image/1090x480/center/images/cropped/eldeq7zwsae3iim-1575579790.jpeg", "site": "@jdforward", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Over 30 West Virginia Prison Guard Trainees Fired Over Nazi Salute Photo", "description": "The trainees regularly gave the Nazi salute \u201cas a sign of respect\u201d for their instructor, a report by state investigators found.", "url": "https://forward.com/fast-forward/437493/west-virginia-prison-nazi-salute-photo/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 186464554784446, "pages": 39846147446}, "p": {"domain_verify": "0ca032fc72a6636649d5cc6684c68bdb"}, "date": "2019-12-31 12:56 -0500", "search.author": "marcyoster", "search.section": "news, fastforward", "search.subsection": "breakingnews, national", "search.timestamp": 1577814960, "search.type": "article", "parsely-title": "Over 30 West Virginia Prison Guard Trainees Fired Over Nazi Salute Photo", "parsely-link": "https://forward.com/fast-forward/437493/west-virginia-prison-nazi-salute-photo/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://images.forwardcdn.com/image/center/images/cropped/eldeq7zwsae3iim-1575579790.jpeg", "parsely-pub-date": "2019-12-31 12:56 -0500", "parsely-section": "Fast Forward", "parsely-tags": "jta,west virginia", "parsely-author": "Marcy Oster", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://forward.com/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "itemprop": 2019}, "canonical_link": "https://forward.com/fast-forward/437493/west-virginia-prison-nazi-salute-photo/"}
