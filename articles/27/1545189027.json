There have been cases reported of the infectious virus spreading to others in a household or workplace in China and elsewhere.\n\nThe new case is the sixth reported in the United States. The other five were travelers who developed the illness after returning to the U.S. from China. The latest patient had not been in China.\n\nThe Chicago woman returned from central China on Jan. 13, then last week went to a hospital with symptoms and was diagnosed with the viral illness. She and her husband, both in their 60s, are hospitalized.\n\nExperts have said they expected additional cases, and that at least some limited spread of the disease in the United States was likely. Health officials think the new virus spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Illinois health officials said that health workers and people who have been in contact with the latest patient are being monitored for symptoms.\n\n\u201cWe anticipated this,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expert. \u201cThe kind of contact that you have in a household is very close and very prolonged. That\u2019s the kind of circumstance where we would anticipate a virus such as this could be transmitted.\"\n\nThe virus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. It is a member of the coronavirus family that's a close cousin to the SARS and MERS viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past. The new virus has sickened thousands, mostly in China, and killed about 170.\n\nAn international outbreak caused by the virus first emerged last month in China. Doctors there began seeing the new virus in people who got sick after spending time at a wholesale food market in Wuhan. Officials said the virus probably initially spread from animals to people, as did SARS and MERS.\n\nThe other U.S. cases are in Arizona, Southern California and Washington state.\n\n-- The Associated Press", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Sports on TV"], "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/pf/resources/images/oregonlive/favicon.ico?d=203", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435, "app_id": 132333146781779}, "title": "1st US case of person-to-person coronavirus infection reported in Chicago", "og": {"title": "1st US case of person-to-person coronavirus infection reported in Chicago", "url": "https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2020/01/1st-us-case-of-person-to-person-coronavirus-infection-reported-in-chicago.html", "site_name": "oregonlive", "type": "article", "description": "The new  case is the sixth reported in the United States.
