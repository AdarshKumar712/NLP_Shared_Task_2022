Officials said after 6 p.m. that a male suspect was arrested but they did not immediately provide more details.\n\nPolice said the theater manager confronted a male who they believed had set off the fireworks.\n\nInside the theater, meanwhile, panicked people called 911 after confusing the bangs with gun shots.\n\nA commenter on the Howell police Facebook page said she was watching a movie when theatergoers heard the noise.\n\n\"The entire theater ran to get out. What a god awful experience. I wouldn\u2019t wish this on anyone,\" the commenter said.\n\nPolice from Jackson and Lakewood also responded.\n\nMore From WOBM News:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["gunshots at howell movie theater", "xscape evacuation", "xscape movie theater gunshots"], "tags": ["Christmas Classic", "Christmas!", "Warrior of the Week", "Ocean County Paranormal", "Howell", "Monmouth County", "Crime", "Weather", "Surf & Sun Report", "WOBM's 50 Memories In 50 Days"], "authors": ["Sergio Bichao"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 18:33:17 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A movie theater was evacuated and a person was arrested on New Year's Day after fireworks outside the building were mistaken for real gunfire.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://townsquare.media/site/40/files/2011/02/tsmfavicon.ico", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "927wobm", "description": "A movie theater was evacuated and a person was arrested on New Year's Day after fireworks outside the building were mistaken for real gunfire.", "keywords": "gunshots at howell movie theater, xscape evacuation, xscape movie theater gunshots", "fb": {"app_id": 107776472668297, "admins": 100002025987268, "pages": 57267536586}, "og": {"title": "1 arrest after fireworks spook an evacuation at Howell movie theater", "description": "A movie theater was evacuated and a person was arrested on New Year's Day after fireworks outside the building were mistaken for real gunfire.", "url": "https://wobm.com/1-arrest-after-fireworks-spook-evacuation-at-howell-movie-theater/", "site_name": "92.7 WOBM", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://townsquare.media/site/385/files/2020/01/Howell.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@wobm"}, "sailthru.description": "A movie theater was evacuated and a person was arrested on New Year's Day after fireworks outside the building were mistaken for real gunfire.", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-01 18:33:17", "sailthru.title": "1 arrest after fireworks spook an evacuation at Howell movie theater", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-wobm-fm, tsmmarket-jerseyshore, tsmtype-local, crime, howell, monmouth-county, new-jersey-news", "sailthru.author": "sbichao", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/385/files/2020/01/Howell.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/385/files/2020/01/Howell.jpg", "google-site-verification": "U6IjiM5xmgfAar4MLKnPGnv31gko1Sg9nHOl4T5BzU8", "viewport": "width=1286, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "https://nj1015.com/1-arrest-after-fireworks-spook-evacuation-at-howell-movie-theater/"}
