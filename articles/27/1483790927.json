The lawns are verdant but the day is dark, angry with topsoil from paddocks where animals graze bare dirt and follow every vehicle with hungry eyes. Similarly, while the war on waste, of all our war arenas, is surely bleeping redder than most, the in-house cafe serves everything with throw-away cutlery and containers. None of it seems accidental. In Canberra everything is symbolic. Now both the anger and the waste remind me how deeply Australia has been shaped by the military mindset.\n\nI\u2019m here to consider Scott Morrison\u2019s newest half-billion-dollar baby; the knock-down rebuild of Anzac Hall, behind the War Memorial museum. Designed by DCM, Anzac Hall is barely 18 years old and bears the nation\u2019s highest architectural honour, the Sir Zelman Cowen Award. If demolished, it will be the only such winner to bite the dust.\n\nAn artist's impression of the expanded of Australian War Memorial. Credit:Australian Community Media\n\nWhich is partly why Morrison\u2019s proposal has generated implacable opposition, with the Institute of Architects running a Hands Off Anzac Hall campaign and publishing an open letter signed by 83 prominent Australians and half a dozen architectural gold medallists.\n\nIn city-making, everything has meaning. Even supposedly accidental cities like Sydney, with its dumb devotion to greed and expedience, comprise sedimentary layers of decision. Even Sydney reifies cultural value and belief. But in Canberra it\u2019s more explicit. Here, the tension between the landscape romanticism of Canberra\u2019s design and the hard-headed militarism of its execution is a constant presence.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Phones", "Canberra", "Architecture", "Column 8", "Home tech", "Explainers", "Quizzes", "For subscribers", "Horoscopes", "Letters", "Scott Morrison", "Obituaries", "Good Weekend", "Gadgets", "Australian War Memorial", "Editorial", "Zelman Cowen"], "authors": ["Elizabeth Farrelly"], "publish_date": "Thu Nov 28 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The proposed renovation of the Australian War Memorial isn't subtle.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicons/smh.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "theme-color": "#0A1633", "title": "Dull, wasteful and overblown - is this the best Australia can do?", "description": "The proposed renovation of the Australian War Memorial isn't subtle.", "article": {"section": "National", "published_time": "2019-11-29T13:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-11-29T08:46:11+00:00"}, "pubdate": "2019-11-29T13:00:00+00:00", "author": "Elizabeth Farrelly", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845, "pages": 1432569230378131}, "og": {"description": "The proposed renovation of the Australian War Memorial isn't subtle.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_584/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/032b8bce708e68ccefb5c93cd4d668750d7ecd68", "width": 800, "height": 450, "secure_url": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_584/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/032b8bce708e68ccefb5c93cd4d668750d7ecd68"}, "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "title": "Dull, wasteful and overblown - is this the best Australia can do?", "url": "https://www.smh.com.au/national/dull-wasteful-and-overblown-is-this-the-best-australia-can-do-20191128-p53f0n.html"}, "parsely-title": "Dull, wasteful and overblown - is this the best Australia can do?", "parsely-link": "https://www.smh.com.au/national/dull-wasteful-and-overblown-is-this-the-best-australia-can-do-20191128-p53f0n.html", "parsely-type": "article", "parsely-image-url": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_584/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/032b8bce708e68ccefb5c93cd4d668750d7ecd68", "parsely-section": "National", "parsely-author": "Elizabeth Farrelly", "parsely-pub-date": "2019-11-29T13:00:00+00:00", "parsely-tags": "Architecture,Sydney,Canberra,Australian War Memorial,Zelman Cowen,Scott Morrison,Melbourne,World War II,United States of America,Iraq,Opinion", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"article\",\"assetId\":\"p53f0n\"}", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,index", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The proposed renovation of the Australian War Memorial isn't subtle.", "image": {"src": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_584/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/032b8bce708e68ccefb5c93cd4d668750d7ecd68"}, "site": "@smh", "title": "Dull, wasteful and overblown - is this the best Australia can do?"}, "google-signin-client_id": "589384154045-p5vk6p2adh6l4p13n8rfjtbsfqu8gbn5.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.smh.com.au/national/dull-wasteful-and-overblown-is-this-the-best-australia-can-do-20191128-p53f0n.html"}
