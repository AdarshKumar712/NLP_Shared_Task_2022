Indeed, Brown\u2019s final eight years in office were mostly smooth sailing, and the dwindling number of Capitol Republicans rarely criticized his administration too harshly. There was plenty to moan about \u2014 the record-setting budgets, a major tax increase, the overheated climate-change rhetoric, the failure to rein in unfunded liabilities \u2014 but a lot to commend, as well. He got a red-ink-soaked budget on track, passed modest pension reform, dealt successfully with a court-driven prison-overcrowding crisis,\n\nNewly-Elected Democrats Let Their\n\nMasks Slip, Revealing The Fascists Beneath 0 replies Posted by Pluperfect \u2014 Post Reply Since the 2018 elections, we have seen a lot of stupid people electing Democrats in state and local elections, and since the garbage Democrats have the garbage Midas touch \u2013 everything they come in contact with turns to a Scat Francisco sidewalk \u2013 these dumb voters are now suffering the consequences of their misguided trust in these aspiring authoritarians. Democrats win when rich donors pump money into races behind candidates who pretend not to be the gimps of the hard-left cabal that actually runs the party. And the radicals who got elected pretending to be not-insane are getting into office and doing all the insane stuff\n\nThe 2010s: A decade of astounding\n\neconomic progress, with\n\ncapitalism and free trade to thank 0 replies Posted by Pluperfect \u2014 Post Reply It's human nature to focus on the negative, so it\u2019s worth starting 2020 with an earnest appreciation of all the gains we made during the last decade. Despite the doom-and-gloom rhetoric of economic disaster pushed by politicians left and right, honest reflection reveals that the 2010s were arguably the single most magnificent decade of economic progress in human history. The statistics showing growth over the last 10 years are almost mind-blowing. Extreme poverty, defined as the number of people globally living on less than $1.90 a day, fell from a whopping 18.2% of the world in 2008 to just 8.6% in 2018. This means that over the last decade or so,\n\nRanking the Democrats: Who has\n\nbest chance of winning nomination? 0 replies Posted by Pluperfect \u2014 Post Reply The battle for the Democratic nomination is nearing crunch time with roughly one month left before the Iowa caucuses. Some big-name candidates have dropped out \u2014 most notably Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) \u2014 while former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has joined the field. Who has the best chance of winning the nomination? 1. Former Vice PresidentJoe Biden (July ranking: 2) Biden has led national polls since he launched his campaign in April. His advantage has eroded since then, but it is still significant. The former vice president is roughly 10 points ahead of his nearest challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), in the polling averages\n\nU.S. moves to protect\n\nour personnel in Iraq 10 replies Posted by Pluperfect \u2014 Post Reply With developments going from bad to worse for the Iranian regime, the mullahs have decided to play a 40 year-old card. They have orchestrated an attack on a U.S. embassy, this time the one in Baghdad. President Trump summarized the situation in this tweet: Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified. Trump\u2019s expectation of protection from the Iraqi government\n\nTrump Proves Not All\n\nInequalities Are Equal 2 replies Posted by Pluperfect \u2014 Post Reply Inequality won the electoral vote for Donald Trump in 2016. Four writers in the Nation admitted as much the day after the election. \u201cInequality created the presidency of Donald Trump,\u201d they wrote. But the president\u2019s antagonists generally appear loath to admit this. They speak of inequality in relation to nations across the globe, the inequality of transgenders, inequality between races or the sexes, and climate change inequality necessitating wealthy nations to pay a tax to offset natural disasters in poorer nations ostensibly caused by the consumption and emissions of the First World.\n\nCarlos Ghosn joins list of thrilling\n\nescapes by finance fugitives 2 replies Posted by Pluperfect \u2014 Post Reply Former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn became the latest high-profile financial fugitive to make a cinematic escape from law-enforcement authorities this week. Mercenaries posing as musicians reportedly helped Ghosn flee financial crimes charges in Japan by dragging him out of the country in a musical instrument case, his first step on the way to Lebanon. But previous business bigwigs have used similarly dramatic means to get out of dodge. One staged his death while others fled for foreign countries only to return and face the music later.\n\nIllinois governor pardons more than 11,000\n\nmarijuana convictions to ring in 2020 5 replies Posted by Pluperfect \u2014 Post Reply Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker granted tens of thousands of pardons for people convicted of low-level marijuana-related offenses on Tuesday. The Land of Lincoln is set to welcome a new marijuana legalization law on January 1, becoming the 11th state to legalize pot for those 21 years of age and older.

He announced the pardons at a church on Chicago's South Side, claiming the action will help offenders find work, housing and college aid.\n\nTexas sheriff\u2019s deputy, an Army vet, fatally\n\nshot during traffic stop; suspect arrested 10 replies Posted by Pluperfect \u2014 Post Reply A Texas sheriff\u2019s deputy died in a hospital Tuesday after being shot multiple times during a traffic stop, authorities said. Deputy Chris Dickerson, 28, a veteran of the U.S. Army and Texas Army National Guard, was with the Panola County Sheriff\u2019s Office for eight years and was the married father of two young children, The Associated Press reported. \u201cThis young man gave his life doing what he was put on this Earth to do,\u201d Sheriff Kevin Lake told the Panola Watchman.\n\nMontana poised to get second\n\nHouse seat post-census: report 6 replies Posted by Pluperfect \u2014 Post Reply The state of Montana could soon be represented by a second representative in the U.S. House after the 2020 census, according to figures released Monday. Census information first reported by The Wall Street Journal found that the state's population grew by nearly 80,000 between 2010 and 2019, leading analysts to predict the state would be among several to gain representatives in Congress following the official results' release next year. Other states projected by the Journal to gain congressional seats include North Carolina, Arizona, Oregon, Florida, and Colorado. States including California, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota were projected to lose one representative each.\n\nObama Was the Most Anti-Semitic\n\nPresident in History, So Let\u2019s\n\nStop Pointing Fingers at Trump 9 replies Posted by Pluperfect \u2014 Post Reply I\u2019ve previously written about how the Democratic Party has embraced anti-Semitism and defended rabid anti-Semites in their party. But as anti-Semitism becomes increasingly mainstream in the Democratic Party, rather than addressing the problem, Democrats are deflecting, trying to paint anti-Semitism as a Trump problem. Rep. Eric Swalwell recently alleged in an op-ed in the Jewish magazine Forward that Donald Trump is \u201cembracing anti-Semitism.\u201d Because Trump, who has a daughter who\u2019s a converted Jew and Jewish grandchildren, is obviously an anti-Semite, or something. In the wake of the Hanukkah celebration stabbing in Monsey, New York, rather than blame the attacker, Democrats chose to blame Trump \u2014 who has done more", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Noah Manskar", "Steven Greenhut", "Kurt Schlichter", "Brad Polumbo", "Niall Stanage", "Paul Mirengoff", "Hunt Lawrence", "Daniel J.
