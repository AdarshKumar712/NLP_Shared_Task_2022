Days after announcing that her new song, \u201cWrong Direction,\u201d would be released on New Year\u2019s Day, fans eagerly awaited Hailee to spill the tea on what went \u201cwrong\u201d between her and Niall. What they got was a thoughtful ballad about the former couple\u2019s breakup and how Hailee is reckoning with how she was treated during the time they dated.\n\nIn the song, Hailee begins with a straight forward lyric that sets the tone for the tune. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you,\u201d she somberly sings. \u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t if I wanted to.\u201d But, Hailee didn\u2019t shy away from telling the subject of her song, \u201cI just hate all the hurt that you put me through.\u201d Throughout the entire piano ballad, the \u201cLove Myself\u201d singer confesses how she \u201cwas crazy to give you my mind, my body\u201d throughout the turbulent relationship. Clearly, the song isn\u2019t exactly a burn to her former flame, but more so an accounting for a courtship that simply wasn\u2019t built to last and Hailee\u2019s own perspective on their time together.\n\nHailee didn\u2019t mention Niall by name when she announced the new single on Dec. 29, but that title wasn\u2019t terribly subtle. Adding fuel to the fire, Hailee shared a series of photos from 2019 on her Instagram stories along with the message, \u201cThankful for all the lessons, the love, the heartbreak, & the memories.\u201d Fans immediately expected this to be a reaction to Niall saying that his upcoming album (due in February or March 2020) is all about breakups. \u201cThere\u2019s all these different sides to a breakup,\u201d he told Jimmy Fallon on the Dec. 12 episode of The Tonight Show. \u201cIt\u2019s not all sad, all the time. When you break up with someone, it\u2019s not just like, I\u2019m sitting at a window. I\u2019m looking out. I\u2019m feeling sorry for myself. It\u2019s raining against that window.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes you\u2019re like out on the town, throwing some shapes and you write songs like \u2018Nice To Meet Ya!\u2019 And then the sad ones come,\u201d he added. \u201cOn this album, I just kind of wanted to write a nice mix of the ups and downs of that.\u201d\n\nHailee and Niall split in December 2018 after a year of low-key dating. At first, reports claimed that their schedules were just too busy for romance. She was about to go on a major press tour for Bumblebee, and he was busy with his solo music career. It actually seemed to be one of the most amicable splits ever. Hailee even went so far to deny claims that she threw shade at her ex in January 2019. After she shared Julia Michaels\u2019 Instagram Story about dating narcissists to her own account, some suspected she was subtweeting Nial. \u201cNo hidden messages, my loves,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cJust reposted an interesting read that I\u2019m sure some of y\u2019all can relate to. Nothing but love!\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong Direction\u201d follow\u2019s \u201cAfterlife,\u201d the single she released in September for her new Apple TV+ series, Dickinson. Though she has released a handful of songs and made appearances on other people\u2019s tracks, fans have been patiently waiting for a follow-up to her 2016 debut, Haiz.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Diet", "Makeover", "Celeb Galleries", "New Year's Eve", "Portrait Series", "Bonnie Says", "Fitness", "Oscar Contenders"], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Music", "Sports Editor"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Hailee Steinfeld's 'Wrong Direction' is an emotional ballad about her previous relationship with the former One Direction singer.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"description": "Hailee Steinfeld's 'Wrong Direction' is an emotional ballad about her previous relationship with the former One Direction singer.", "news_keywords": "Hailee Steinfeld, Niall Horan", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Hailee Steinfeld Drops Breakup Ballad \u2018Wrong Direction\u2019 One Year After Split From Niall Horan \u2014 Listen", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/01/01/hailee-steinfeld-wrong-direction-new-song-niall-horan/", "description": "In honor of a brand new year, Hailee Steinfeld has buried her relationship with Niall Horan in the past with her new song, \u2018Wrong Direction,\u2019 where the singer laments about how she fell &#821\u2026", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/hailee-steinfeld-niall-horan-new-song-rex-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 349, "alt": "hailee steinfeld niall horan new song"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T15:30:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T15:32:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "text": {"title": "Hailee Steinfeld Drops Breakup Ballad \u2018Wrong Direction\u2019 One Year After Split From Niall Horan \u2014 Listen"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/hailee-steinfeld-niall-horan-new-song-rex-ftr.jpg?w=620", "alt": "hailee steinfeld niall horan new song"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hailee Steinfeld Drops Breakup Ballad \u2018Wrong Direction\u2019 One Year After Split From Niall Horan \u2014 Listen", "description": "Hailee Steinfeld's 'Wrong Direction' is an emotional ballad about her previous relationship with the former One Direction singer."}, "author": "Jason Brow", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/01/01/hailee-steinfeld-wrong-direction-new-song-niall-horan/?ia_markup=1"}, "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://hollywoodlife.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=16", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/01/01/hailee-steinfeld-wrong-direction-new-song-niall-horan/"}
