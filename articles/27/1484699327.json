In addition, tens of millions of dollars are expected to have been raised by the Republican National Committee and other affiliated groups, which will report their finances later this month.\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s haul was bolstered by bumper fundraising days surrounding the president\u2019s impeachment by the House last month. The campaign said the investigation and subsequent vote have motivated the supporters to rally around Trump.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s war chest and grassroots army make his re-election campaign an unstoppable juggernaut,\u201d said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale in a statement.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Associated Press.
