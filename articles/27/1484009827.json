We then have to depend on the MP (Member of Parliament) or sponsors for help, but sometimes the water doesn't come quick enough so we have to close for a few days until it comes. So these two tanks will make a big difference,\u201d Anderson explained.\n\nPaulette Ferguson, the JCSA's Manchester chapter chair, said the water tank initiative for Sydney L Blake Basic School \u201cwas borne out of a needs assessment... this particular school had the greatest need, as the school, over the years, has been having challenges accessing water\u201d.\n\nAssurances came from Raymond Nesbeth, representing the NWC, and Rohan Kennedy, councillor for the Mile Gully Division, that they would move quickly to have the tanks refilled whenever asked to do so.\n\n\u201cWhenever you are out [of water], call on me...\u201d said Kennedy.\n\n\u2014 Garfield Myers", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["General NewsInternationalLocal NewsToday's Headlines"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jamaica Observer Limited"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "MANDEVILLE, Manchester \u2014 Like much of the rest of central Jamaica, the availability...", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"alexaVerifyID": "rSmiGOPEjbvIe54g6VDdjp7fxDQ", "google-site-verification": "yGWL0JARPWTYZuQO6SyybESnW5Tn5sn_mj5vRQhwZq8", "y_key": "b1206159d404874b", "msvalidate.01": "F356DE1E2BCA8CFA747B5120592BE455", "description": "MANDEVILLE, Manchester \u2014 Like much of the rest of central Jamaica, the availability...", "keywords": "General NewsInternationalLocal NewsToday's Headlines", "og": {"title": "Water tanks to make", "site_name": "Jamaica Observer", "image": "http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/JO/20200101/ARTICLE/301019986/AR/0/AR-301019986.jpg"}, "revisit-after": "1 days", "Author": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "DC.Subject": "Jamaica, Observer", "DC.Title": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "ROBOTS": "Follow,Index", "rating": "GENERAL", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@JamaicaObserver", "creator": "@JamaicaObserver", "title": "Water tanks to make", "description": "MANDEVILLE, Manchester \u2014 Like much of the rest of central Jamaica, the availability...", "image": "http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/JO/20200101/ARTICLE/301019986/AR/0/AR-301019986.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": ""}
