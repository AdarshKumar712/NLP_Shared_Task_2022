The company eventually plans to scale its operations to a national level soon.\n\nReliance\u2019s chairman Ambani had hinted towards the company\u2019s entry into the ecommerce segment last year. Then again in August 2019, at the Reliance\u2019s 42 annual meet, it announced that it plans to connect three crore offline retailers to more than 20 Cr households with its latest venture.\n\nAmbani also added, \u201cOur beta trials with thousands of merchants across multiple locations in the country established the premise of New Commerce with significant increase in sales and improvement in margins for the participating merchants. We are now getting ready to roll out the platform at a larger scale.\u201d\n\nRelated Article: Reliance Jio Starts Trials For Including Electric Vehicles In Delivery Fleet\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s website, the platform is expected to host a catalogue of 50K grocery products. It will also provide free home delivery against no minimum order value. The company also assures that it will offer no questions asked return, and express delivery.\n\nA report in Mint highlighted that Reliance has invited its telecom service Jio\u2019s users to register for Jio Mart and avail preliminary discounts. Reliance\u2019s website also highlights that the early customers will get up to INR 3K for pre-registration.\n\nWith Reliance\u2019s entry into the online grocery delivery market, the competition has become more difficult for unicorns like Grofers and BigBasket, who are currently working on their path to profitability.\n\nHow Are Grofers And Bigbasket Fairing?\n\nRecently, Grofers announced that it is profitable in Delhi and is on the same path in Mumbai. In addition, the company also noted that it is at a break-even point in Kolkata, with Lucknow on the way. The company believes that this progress in its independent regional units would fuel its overall profitability.\n\nOn the other hand, Bigbasket has announced that it is close to the breakeven point in 10 Tier 1 cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, in the next three to four months. Bigbasket\u2019s cofounder Hari Menon also announced that the company will start discussing its path to profitability in 2020-21.\n\nIn addition, even the major ecommerce players like Amazon and Flipkart have entered the grocery delivery businesses.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Amazon", "Acquisitions", "Flipkart", "Reliance Jio", "Ola", "Uber", "Reliance", "Paytm", "Funding"], "authors": ["Aman Rawat", "Kritti B.", "Shanthi S", "Bhumika K.", "Meha A.", "Kopal C.", "Suprita A.", "Bihu Ray", "Kritti Bhalla", "Akhil A."], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 12:02:54 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance has finally entered the grocery delivery market with its new hyperlocal Kirana-led retail emarketplace, Jio Mart.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i0.wp.com/cdn.inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-favicon.png?fit=32%2C32&ssl=1", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "h__t14aH4KCSmW8JRpC9ITgIu-YEINK1VL_LkAdOr_c", "msvalidate.01": "A4C6FEB0E3162AD917341D52087BA093", "p": {"domain_verify": "8e998febb5441e4be3359a745e93c40e"}, "description": "Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance has finally entered the grocery delivery market with its new hyperlocal Kirana-led retail emarketplace, Jio Mart.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Reliance\u2019s Jio Mart Heats Up Hyperlocal Grocery Delivery Market", "description": "Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance has finally entered the grocery delivery market with its new hyperlocal Kirana-led retail emarketplace, Jio Mart.", "url": "https://inc42.com/buzz/reliances-jio-mart-heats-up-hyperlocal-grocery-delivery-market", "site_name": "Inc42 Media", "updated_time": "2020-01-02T08:22:29+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/cdn.inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Top-50-Angel-Investors-32.jpg?fit=1200%2C628&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/cdn.inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Top-50-Angel-Investors-32.jpg?fit=1200%2C628&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Inc42", "tag": "Reliance Jio", "section": "News", "published_time": "2019-12-31T12:02:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T08:22:29+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 170406700461672}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance has finally entered the grocery delivery market with its new hyperlocal Kirana-led retail emarketplace, Jio Mart.", "title": "Reliance\u2019s Jio Mart Heats Up Hyperlocal Grocery Delivery Market", "site": "@inc42", "image": "https://cdn.inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Top-50-Angel-Investors-32.jpg", "creator": "@Krittiiii"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "https://inc42.com", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/cdn.inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1", "theme-color": "#D81757"}, "canonical_link": "https://inc42.com/buzz/reliances-jio-mart-heats-up-hyperlocal-grocery-delivery-market/"}
