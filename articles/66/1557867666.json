He made the decision in a White House briefing on Monday. The move comes as a direct result of COVID-19 concerns.\n\nThe President said: \u201cI\u2019m also announcing that we\u2019re postponing the deadline for compliance with REAL ID requirements. At a time when we\u2019re asking Americans to maintain social distancing, we don\u2019t want to require people to go with their local DMV. We will be announcing the new deadline very soon. It\u2019s going to be announced in a very short moment.\u201d\n\nLast week, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio of Oregon and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi advised against requiring people to wait in a crowded waiting room for hours.\n\nIn a joint statement, they said: \u201cFor implementation to go smoothly, the Department of Homeland Security would need tens of millions of Americans to get new identifications over the next several months. Creating lines at Departments of Motor Vehicles would be foolish during a pandemic.\u201d\n\nA REAL ID, or REAL ID-compliant identification, will eventually be required to board a domestic flight or enter a federal building in the U.S..\n\nThe Alaska Department of Motor Vehicles provides an online guide to know which documents are required to apply for a REAL ID, and they advise that everyone prepare, as the application must be done in-person.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Author", "Jason Lee", "Read All Posts Jason Lee"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "fb": {"pages": 311847258664, "admins": 311847258664, "app_id": 1571791936449655}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.radiokenai.net/president-trump-extends-deadline-to-obtain-real-id/?ia_markup=1"}, "og": {"url": "https://www.radiokenai.net/president-trump-extends-deadline-to-obtain-real-id/", "title": "President Trump Extends Deadline To Obtain REAL ID", "site_name": "Radio Kenai", "description": "President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for residents to obtain a REAL ID.
