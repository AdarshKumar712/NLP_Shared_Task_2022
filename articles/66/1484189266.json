He was interested only in establishing the Dollar as the international reserve currency, a proposal that he was certain would be acceptable to the US Congress.\n\nThe idea of the Bancor has been kept in subdued conversation among economists. Until now. Currently, that idea appears to be the core of a proposal that is presumed to be implemented in a few days by the International Monetary Fund.\n\nJames Rickards, an insider consultant and financial writer, is warning that a \"Global Financial Elite\" has the support of the IMF to a plan to replace by December 31, 2019, the US currency with a new \"Distributed Ledger System\" using the IMF's \"Special Drawing Rights\" as a new \"global reserve currency.\" This plan is a perversion of Keynes' thought about the Bancor.\n\nThe Bancor was supposed to be a unit of account, with no implicit exchange value.\n\nHow to Set Things Right\n\nWith three clarifications, the spirit of the Bancor may be revivified:\n\nFirst, taking a leaf from experience rather than abstract theory, as it was finally incorporated into the IMF's \"Special Drawing Rights\" the Bancor would have exchange value, a value ultimately determined by international financial markets.\n\nSecond clarification is that the Bancor ought to be created by each national Central Bank, so that we would have the American Bancor, the Swiss Bancor, the Chinese Bancor, etc. Let us temporarily call it the xBancor. Today's computers' power will easily let us ascertain the value of each Bancor at each moment in time.\n\nThe third clarification is most important. Each national Bancor would have to be distributed in accordance with three rules developed within the context of Concordian monetary policy. The Bancor should be issued as a loan:\n\nonly to create real wealth of tables and chairs, not to purchase financial instruments; to individual entrepreneurs, cooperatives, corporations with ESOPs and/or CSOPs in their constitutions, and public agencies with taxing power so that the loan can be repaid; at cost.\n\nWhen Should the xBancor Be Created?\n\nThe xBancor should be created as soon as possible; as soon as a national - and international - discussion occurs to gain acceptance of this financial instrument. But not later than a few hours after the next financial crash occurs.\n\nWhat Value Should Be Assigned to the xBancor?\n\nEach xBancor should be created at par value with each existing national currency: thus, 1 US Bancor = $1.00; 1 Swiss Bancor = 1 Swiss Franc ; 1 Chinese Bancor = 1 renmimbi.\n\nYes, the value of each Bancor would be allowed to fluctuate as the value of today's currencies fluctuates.\n\nNext Page 1 | 2 | 3", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Bondholders", "Credit", "Economy", "Global Currency", "Global Financial Collapse", "Global Financial Crisis", "Global Reserve Currency", "Jobs", "John Maynard Keynes", "Keynes-Maynard", "Keynesian", "Stop An Extrajudicial Killing", "Workers"], "tags": ["Keynes-Maynard", "Jobs", "Global Financial Crisis", "Economy", "Global Currency", "Bondholders", "Global Reserve Currency", "Keynesian", "Workers", "Credit", "John Maynard Keynes", "Global Financial Collapse", "Stop An Extrajudicial Killing"], "authors": ["Carmine Gorga"], "publish_date": "Fri Dec 19 21:00:00 2031", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Article: Stop The Global Financial Elite Perversion Of John Maynard Keynes - Are we ready to get Keynes' thought right yet?
