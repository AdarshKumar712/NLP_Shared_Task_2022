Credit: AP/Facebook\n\nThai police on Sunday shot dead a soldier who killed 26 people and wounded 57 in the worst mass shooting in the country\u2019s history. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha confirmed the numbers of victims after the overnight siege was ended by police on Sunday morning, 16 hours after it began, at a shopping mall in the north-western city of Nakhon Ratchasima, also known as Korat. Officials said the man \u2013 identified by military officials as Sergeant Major Jakrapanth Thomma \u2013 was angry over a financial dispute. He first killed two people, a fellow soldier and a woman, then went on a far bloodier spree, shooting as he drove to the mall where shoppers fled in terror.\n\nThe man has been named as Jakraphanth Thomma. Credit: Facebook\n\nThe man also posted updates to his Facebook page during the rampage. \u201cNo one can escape death,\u201d read one post. Another asked, \u201cShould I give up?\u201d In a later post, he wrote, \u201cI have stopped already.\u201d \u201cThis incident was unprecedented in Thailand,\u201d Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters as he gave the final death toll on Sunday morning after visiting the wounded in hospitals. \u201cI hope this is the only one and the last incident, and that it never happens again. No one wants this to happen. It could be because of this person\u2019s mental health in this particular moment,\u201d he said. Mr Prayuth said he was worried that people inside the mall could be accidentally hit by bullets fired by police, but added: \u201cI have checked, that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d A photo circulated on social media that appeared to be taken from the Facebook page shows a man wearing a green camouflaged military helmet while a fireball and black smoke rage behind him. Jakrapanth\u2019s profile picture shows him in a mask and dressed in military-style fatigues and armed with a pistol. The background image is of a handgun and bullets. The Facebook page was made inaccessible after the shooting began.\n\nA group of armed commando soldiers outside Terminal 21 Korat mall, in Nakhon Ratchasima.

Video taken outside the mall showed people diving for cover as shots rang out. Many were killed outside the mall, some in cars, others while walking. City and neighbourhood police officers said Jakrapanth took a gun from his base and drove to the Terminal 21 Korat mall, shooting along the way. Several Thai media reported he travelled in a military vehicle.\n\nA wanted poster released by Crime Suppression Division of The Royal Thai Police.
