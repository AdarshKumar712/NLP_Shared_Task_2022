It was short notice. It was 36 hours before.\n\n\u201cWe were concerned because we had three weddings booked that weekend as well.\u201d\n\nThe owners said they took action to protect the region as well as their neighbours if it eventuated some visitors carried COVID-19.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["News", "Augusta-Margaret River Times", "News", "South West", "Sport", "Regional"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Warren Hately", "Augusta Margaret River Times"], "publish_date": "Fri Mar 27 02:23:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "WA\u2019s Premier has defended a decision not to intervene when the Queen Mary 2 cruise ship docked in Busselton last fortnight, dispersing travellers on daytrips across the region.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://thewest.com.au/static/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "AAB93AFA533AEBE913449C2EE9895627", "msapplication-config": "https://thewest.com.au/static/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "The West Australian", "url": "https://thewest.com.au/news/augusta-margaret-river-times/protocols-were-followed-ng-b881500296z", "title": "Fears after cruise ship visit", "description": "WA\u2019s Premier has defended a decision not to intervene when the Queen Mary 2 cruise ship docked in Busselton last fortnight, dispersing travellers on daytrips across the region.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/B881500296Z/1585275995165_G7U2MJHAV.2-2.JPG?imwidth=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "Cunard's QM2.
