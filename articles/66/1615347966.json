system as he arrived at court for the start of his corruption trial, accusing police and prosecutors of conspiring to \u201cdepose\u201d him.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s comments opened what is sure to be a tumultuous period for Israel as he becomes the country\u2019s first sitting prime minister ever to go on trial.\n\nNetanyahu faces charges of fraud, breach of trust, and accepting bribes in a series of corruption cases stemming from ties to wealthy friends.\n\nHe is accused of accepting lavish gifts and offering to grant favours to powerful media moguls in exchange for favourable coverage of him and his family.\n\nHe denies the charges.\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, right, attends court (Ronen Zvulun/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nNetanyahu entered the Jerusalem courtroom wearing a blue surgical mask, in line with public health restriction due to the coronavirus pandemic. He stood and talked to his lawyer and lawyers for other defendants, refusing to sit until TV cameras left the room.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAs the proceedings began, the lawyers and judges also wore masks, with the three-judge panel sitting behind a glass divider.\n\nHis lawyers said they would need two to three months to respond to the arraignment, and said they needed additional funds to add to their defence\u2019s legal team.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s convoy arrives at Jerusalem district court (Sebastian Scheiner/AP)\n\nNetanyahu sat silently and did not speak during the one-hour session, rising just once, briefly, to confirm that he understood the charges.\n\nAdvertising\n\nHe will not be required to attend future hearings during a case that legal analysts expect to stretch over several years.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, the loud chants of his supporters could be heard in the courtroom.\n\nWhen he arrived at the courthouse, Netanyahu revived his claims that he is the victim of a deep state-type conspiracy by media, police, prosecutors and judges out to oust him.\n\n\u201cThe objective is to depose a strong, right-wing prime minister, and thus remove the nationalist camp from the leadership of the country for many years,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said police and prosecutors had conspired to \u201ctailor\u201d a case against him, and said the evidence was \u201ccontaminated\u201d and exaggerated. He called for the court proceedings to be broadcast live on TV to ensure \u201cfull transparency\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile the media continues to deal with nonsense, with these false, trumped-up cases, I will continue to lead the state of Israel and deal with issues that really matter to you,\u201d he said, including to resuscitate the economy and \u201ccontinue to save the lives of thousands of Israelis ahead of the possibility of a second wave of coronavirus.\u201d\n\nCritics have said that Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cdeep state\u201d arguments have undermined Israel\u2019s court system and risk deeper damage to the country\u2019s democratic institutions.\n\nAvi Nissenkorn, the country\u2019s new justice minister, defended the legal system just before Netanyahu arrived in court.\n\nIsrael \u201cis blessed with a quality justice system without bias,\u201d Mr Nissenkorn wrote on Twitter. \u201cI have no doubt that the judicial process will be managed in a matter-of-fact and fair fashion.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu was forced to attend Sunday\u2019s hearing at the Jerusalem district court, after his request to have his lawyers represent him instead was rejected.\n\nProtesters wave flags and banners outside Netanyahu\u2019s residence in Jerusalem (Ariel Schalit/AP)\n\nThe dramatic scene came just days after the long-serving leader swore in his new government, breaking more than a year of political stalemate following three inconclusive elections.\n\nNetanyahu held his first Cabinet meeting with the new government just hours before heading to court.\n\nNeither he nor any of his ministers addressed the looming trial but the country\u2019s outgoing religious affairs minister wished Netanyahu that \u201cGod will bring the truth out\u201d at his trial.\n\nNetanyahu and his allies have spent months lashing out the country\u2019s law enforcement system, and the charges against him have deeply divided the nation.\n\nAhead of the trial, two sets of protests and counter-protests gathered outside the courthouse and the prime minister\u2019s official residence in Jerusalem.\n\nSeveral of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Cabinet ministers, including the newly appointed internal security minister who oversees the police, came to the court to back him.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s court appearance on Sunday caps a three-year investigation.\n\nIt also comes after more than a year of political turmoil, with three inconclusive elections finally ending last month when the Israeli leader and his main rival, former army chief Benny Gantz, came to a power-sharing deal.\n\nAs part of their power-sharing deal, Netanyahu will remain prime minister for the next 18 months, and alternative prime minister for the 18 months after, and will not be legally required to step down during what is expected to be a lengthy trial.\n\nIn a tweet, Mr Gantz said he was sure Netanyahu will receive a fair trial.\n\n\u201cI repeat and emphasise that my colleagues and I have full faith in the justice system and law enforcement,\u201d he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sun May 24 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html":
