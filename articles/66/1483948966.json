For instance, in October 2016, the far-left publication Politico boldly declared that \u201cWall Street is set up for a major crash if Donald Trump shocks the world on Election Day and wins the White House.\u201d\n\nThe ability of Trump\u2019s critics to predict our economic future hasn\u2019t improved with age. Throughout 2019, numerous so-called \u201ceconomists\u201d and \u201cexperts\u201d have taken a swing at the president's economic policies, warning Americans that the next stock market crash was right around the corner.\n\nDAVID BOSSIE: TRUMP PERSEVERES IN 2019 \u2014 STANDS TALL DESPITE RELENTLESS ATTACKS FROM DEMOCRATS AND MEDIA\n\nIn January, the uber-liberal Huffington Post published a typically baseless piece titled \u201c4 Signs Another Recession Is Coming \u2015 And What It Means For You.\u201d Vox published a similar fear-mongering prediction over the summer, arguing that Wall Street \u201cis at a point where it can\u2019t \u2014 or won\u2019t \u2014 ignore President Donald Trump\u2019s trade antics and Twitter tirades like it used to.\u201d\n\nAnd who could forget some of the most recent warnings that slam Trump\u2019s trade policy, such as Investor\u2019s Business Daily\u2019s headline: \u201cStock Market Reaction To Tariffs: Wall Street Has Seen This Before; The End Is Not Good.\u201d\n\nDespite the doom and gloom, as 2019 came to an end, the president inched ever-closer to a revolutionary trade deal with China, completing negotiations on what has been called phase one of that agreement. The Trump administration also successfully campaigned to get the U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Agreement approved by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives, further instilling confidence and optimism in entrepreneurs that the ongoing economic renaissance is here to stay.\n\nThe Democrats love to make predictions about President Trump\u2019s policies, but they don\u2019t seem to learn from their own mistakes.\n\nNot surprisingly (unless you suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome), investors responded. The S&P 500 finished 2019 up 29 percent, its best year since 2013. The Nasdaq finished the year up 35 percent, shattering the 9,000 level for the first time in history. The Dow\u2019s listing of blue-chip stocks rose an impressive 22 percent. These results leave little doubt that investors are fully confident in the U.S. economy \u2013 despite the droning criticism from the Left.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn fact, under Trump, the benchmark S&P 500 has already returned over 50 percent and is performing well above the average under past administrations.\n\nThese returns aren\u2019t just for the millionaires and billionaires you heard so much about if you listened to the millionaires and billionaires who participated in the Democratic presidential debates describe how they would tank the economy \u2013 for our own good. Rather, according to Gallup, about 55 percent of American workers own stocks either individually or through mutual funds or retirement savings accounts, like a 401(k) or an IRA. They have all been positively impacted by stock market growth under Trump and I can guarantee you they noticed. That\u2019s a lot of voters.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNo wonder Democrats have so aggressively pursued an obviously futile attempt to remove the president from office. At this point, it's all they\u2019ve got \u2013 and it isn\u2019t much.\n\nThe Democrats love to make predictions about President Trump\u2019s policies, but they don\u2019t seem to learn from their own mistakes. As Trump said in response to the latest stock market surge, \u201cWith new trade deals, and more, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDY PUZDER", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Andy Puzder", "Andy Puzder Was Chief Executive Officer Of"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The only thing that rivals Trump\u2019s tally of kept promises is the endless list of inaccurate predictions his critics have made about the U.S. economy.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The only thing that rivals Trump\u2019s tally of kept promises is the endless list of inaccurate predictions his critics have made about the U.S. economy.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "opinion", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Andy Puzder", "dc.title": "Andy Puzder: Trump economy defies critics \u2013 2019 another year of the 'experts' getting it all wrong", "dcterms.abstract": "The only thing that rivals Trump\u2019s tally of kept promises is the endless list of inaccurate predictions his critics have made about the U.S. economy.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "The only thing that rivals Trump\u2019s tally of kept promises is the endless list of inaccurate predictions his critics have made about the U.S. economy.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:c15c4db0-4da6-578c-b9b9-947da8ca38a7", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2019-12-31", "dcterms.created": "2019-12-31T14:15:31-05:00", "dcterms.modified": "2020-01-01T08:00:43-05:00", "og": {"title": "Andy Puzder: Trump economy defies critics \u2013 2019 another year of the 'experts' getting it all wrong", "description": "The only thing that rivals Trump\u2019s tally of kept promises is the endless list of inaccurate predictions his critics have made about the U.S. economy.", "type": "article", "image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/12/26/694940094001_6118324810001_6118323131001-vs.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/andy-puzder-trump-economy-defies-critics-2019-another-year-of-the-experts-getting-it-all-wrong", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Andy Puzder: Trump economy defies critics \u2013 2019 another year of the 'experts' getting it all wrong", "description": "The only thing that rivals Trump\u2019s tally of kept promises is the endless list of inaccurate predictions his critics have made about the U.S. economy.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/12/26/1024/512/694940094001_6118324810001_6118323131001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/andy-puzder-trump-economy-defies-critics-2019-another-year-of-the-experts-getting-it-all-wrong"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "true"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/PERSON/Donald Trump,/FOX NEWS/OPINION,/FOX NEWS/US/Economy", "classification-isa": "donald-trump,opinion,economy"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/andy-puzder-trump-economy-defies-critics-2019-another-year-of-the-experts-getting-it-all-wrong"}
