They will also be on display next week at CES, an enormous consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas that typically serves as a window into the year\u2019s hottest tech developments.\n\nAt the show, next-generation cellular technology known as 5G, which delivers data at mind-boggling speeds, is expected to take center stage as one of the most important topics. We are also likely to see the evolution of smart homes, with internet-connected appliances such as refrigerators, televisions and vacuum cleaners working more seamlessly together \u2014 and with less human interaction required.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is connected everything,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst for the research firm Creative Strategies. \u201cAnything in the home \u2014 we\u2019ll have more cameras, more mics, more sensors.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Brian X.
