Instead, I think it came as a crack in President Trump\u2019s armor, in the form of an editorial calling for Trump\u2019s removal from office.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t reverse course now,\u201d the evangelical magazine Christianity Today opined, \u201cwill anyone take anything we say about justice and righteousness with any seriousness for decades to come? Can we say with a straight face that abortion is a great evil that cannot be tolerated and, with the same straight face, say that the bent and broken character of our nation\u2019s leader doesn\u2019t really matter in the end?\u201d\n\nIn other words, if opponents of abortion rights want to have any \u201cmoral authority\u201d whatsoever, they can\u2019t be standing with an immoral president \u2014 a point that will haunt a lot of Trump-supporting Christians all year long.\n\nAnd speaking of immoral behavior, here\u2019s an incredible question a lot of people are asking these days: If Trump loses re-election in November, will he step down? And if he refused to give up the presidency, would the Senate oppose the coup attempt? I want so badly to say that\u2019s an absurd question, but given Trump\u2019s and the Republican Party\u2019s behavior these days, you\u2019ve got to wonder.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Democratic Party contest for who gets to take on Trump. I have no idea who\u2019s going to win the nomination, but this much is pretty clear: Whoever gets the party nod will capture at least half the popular vote, because that\u2019s roughly the number of \u201cNever Trump\u201d Americans (both Democrats and Republicans) who will \u2014 to corrupt an old Southern saying \u2014 vote for a yellow dog over Donald Trump.\n\nTom McDonald is editor of the New Mexico Community News Exchange.
