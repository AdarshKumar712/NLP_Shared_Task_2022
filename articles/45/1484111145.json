They allege that Trump was seeking investigations into his political opponents.\n\nTrump has denied those claims of a quid pro quo, while he has sought to turn the spotlight onto Biden\u2019s involvement in the country \u2014 specifically his role in the firing of a top Ukrainian prosecutor who had previously investigated a Ukrainian energy company where Hunter sat on the board.\n\nThe House is expected to eventually transmit its articles of impeachment to the Republican-controlled Senate for a trial. The White House is hoping that it will allow them to go on the attack, although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has suggested he would seek a short trial.\n\nGiuliani has played a central role in promoting theories in relation to Democrats and Ukraine, and told reporters Tuesday that he had learned of \u201cvast\u201d corruption in Ukraine involving Democrats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWhat I learned is that the corruption in Ukraine is vast.
