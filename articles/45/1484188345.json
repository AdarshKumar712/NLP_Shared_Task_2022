The well-known sailor and the retired owner of McCready Sailboats chandlery in Holywood, Wic McCready, and Jackie were the last to win an Irish championship. The class is still active in the rest of the UK and internationally.\n\nAs reported previously in Afloat.ie there was an august gathering of Irish 505 sailors at the National Yacht Club on Thursday 7th November to commemorate the second European Championships of the class, which was held in Dun Laoghaire in August 1969.\n\nFormer 505 sailors came from far and wide across the island of Ireland to remember the championships, which helped build a young and dynamic group who went on to contribute greatly to Irish Sailing over the following 50 years.\n\nJackie can be contacted at [email protected]", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["505", "Belfast Lough"], "tags": ["Belfast Lough", "505"], "authors": ["Betty Armstrong", "Read More Articles Betty Armstrong"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The fleet disbanded in the mid-1980s.
