(WWLP) \u2013 Automatic voter registration would allow Massachusetts residents to register to vote or opt-out when they interact with the Registry of Motor Vehicles and MassHealth.\n\nGov. Charlie Baker signed a bill approving the system last year, joining more than a dozen states in making it easier to register and vote in elections.\n\nState residents who change their addresses with the RMV or with Mass Health will have their voter registration updated automatically.\n\nThis comes at a good time for one Northampton resident who recently moved from Worcester.\n\nBrian Cowles told 22News, \u201cI think anything is helpful, to make registering more convenient. I moved twice in the last two years, I haven\u2019t registered in the new town I live in, so hopefully, this will take care of me.\u201d\n\nSupporters are also confident this new system will increase voter turnout for the March 3 presidential primary.\n\nThe deadline to register to vote in the primaries is February 12th.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Your Local Election Headquarters", "More State Police Overtime Investigation"], "authors": ["Hector Molina", "Nancy Asiamah", "Kristina D'Amours", "Nick Aresco"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 21:44:38 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The New Year brings a new way to register to vote in Massachusetts.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.wwlp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2019/05/cropped-22News-Favicon-1.jpg?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The New Year brings a new way to register to vote in Massachusetts.", "google-site-verification": "McT98raStSHKcKLXAnIZjZPdRiUNhtGenV0g2WGzemw", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "fb": {"pages": 16780999098}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "A new year means a new way to vote", "url": "https://www.wwlp.com/news/local-news/hampden-county/a-new-year-means-a-new-way-to-vote/", "description": "The New Year brings a new way to register to vote in Massachusetts.", "site_name": "WWLP", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.wwlp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2020/01/auto-vote-reg.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "secure_url": "https://www.wwlp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2020/01/auto-vote-reg.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T21:44:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T22:20:56+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "A new year means a new way to vote"}, "image": "https://www.wwlp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2020/01/auto-vote-reg.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A new year means a new way to vote", "description": "The New Year brings a new way to register to vote in Massachusetts."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.wwlp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2019/05/cropped-22News-Favicon-1.jpg?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.wwlp.com/news/local-news/hampden-county/a-new-year-means-a-new-way-to-vote/"}
