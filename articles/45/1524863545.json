And this year that will be offered free.\u201d\n\nThe district will also be lenient with parents and staff who had already booked plans in August.\n\n\u201cThe first two weeks of August when we\u2019re going to be coming in- we don\u2019t normally come back then,\u201d Cagle began. \u201cWe have agreed to excuse those days if they already have them booked.\u201d\n\nSpencer Scott heads up the non-profit group First Steps for Marion and Florence Counties.
