He now needs the protection and security of his government after fleeing Japan, they added.\n\nA media advisor to the president\u2019s office denied the two men had met.\n\nLebanese officials have said there would be no need to take legal measures against Ghosn because he entered the country legally on a French passport, although Ghosn\u2019s French, Lebanese and Brazilian passports are with lawyers in Japan.\n\nThe French and Lebanese foreign ministries have said they were unaware of the circumstances of his journey.\n\nLebanon has no extradition agreement with Japan, where Ghosn faced trial on charges of financial misconduct, which he denied.\n\nUnder the terms of his bail, he had been confined to his house in Tokyo and had to have cameras installed at the entrance. He was prevented from communicating with his wife and had his use of the internet and other communications curtailed.\n\nThe sources said the Lebanese ambassador to Japan had visited him daily while he was in detention.\n\nWhile some Lebanese media have floated a Houdini-like account of Ghosn being packed in a wooden container for musical instruments after a private concert in his home, his wife called the account pure fiction when contacted by Reuters.\n\nShe declined to provide details of the exit of one of the most recognized titans of industry. The accounts of the two sources suggest a carefully planned escape few were aware of.\n\nThey said a private security firm oversaw the plan, which was three months in the making and involved shuttling Ghosn out via a private jet to Istanbul before pushing onward to Beirut, with even the pilot unaware of Ghosn\u2019s presence on board.\n\n\u201cIt was a very professional operation from start to finish,\u201d said one of the sources. The other source said Ghosn was in good health.\n\nIn a written statement, Ghosn said after his arrival that he had \u201cescaped injustice and political persecution\u201d and would begin communicating with media next week. Sources close to him said he was unwilling to share details of his escape so as not to jeopardize those who aided him in Japan.\n\nHe is staying at the home of a relative of his wife, but plans to return soon to a gated villa in the upscale Beirut neighborhood of Achrafieh, one of the sources said.\n\nHe was first arrested in Tokyo in November 2018 and faces four charges \u2014 which he denies \u2014 including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.\n\nNissan sacked him as chairman, saying internal investigations revealed misconduct, including understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5 million of Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest.\n\nGhosn has enjoyed an outpouring of support from Lebanese since his 2018 arrest, with billboards proclaiming \u201cWe are all Carlos Ghosn\u201d erected in solidarity with his case.\n\nLocally he is considered a poster boy for success in a country where rampant unemployment pushes young Lebanese abroad to find work and the economy relies heavily on remittances amid a deep financial crisis that has sparked a wave of protests.\n\nGhosn was born in Brazil but of Lebanese descent and lived in Lebanon as a child. He oversaw a turnaround at French carmaker Renault that won him the nickname \u201cLe Cost Killer\u201d and used similar methods to revive Nissan.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Tokyo", "France", "Brazil", "Lebanon", "Nissan", "Renault", "Istanbul", "Carlos Ghosn", "Beirut", "Michel Aoun"], "tags": ["Lebanon", "Brazil", "France", "Renault", "Carlos Ghosn", "Beirut", "Istanbul", "Michel Aoun", "Nissan", "Tokyo"], "authors": ["No Author"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Fugitive former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn met Lebanon's president after his escape from Japan, where he was smuggled out of house arrest by a private se", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/wp-content/themes/jt_theme/library/img/japantimes-favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"verify-v1": "+h35BdFddo/f1upXot92yGKSB4d5EuWWGbARz9SJE6A=", "twitter": {"account_id": 7424642, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/n-ghosnster-a-20200103-870x489.jpg", "site": "@japantimes", "creator": "@japantimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Japan Times", "robots": "noodp", "author": "No Author", "article": {"author": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/author/no-author/", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thejapantimes", "tag": "Michel Aoun"}, "thumbnail": "https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/n-ghosnster-a-20200103-200x200.jpg", "description": "Fugitive former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn met Lebanon's president after his escape from Japan, where he was smuggled out of house arrest by a private se", "keywords": "Tokyo, France, Brazil, Lebanon, Nissan, Renault, Istanbul, Carlos Ghosn, Beirut, Michel Aoun", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Carlos Ghosn met Lebanese president after fleeing Japan: sources | The Japan Times", "description": "Fugitive former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn met Lebanon's president after his escape from Japan, where he was smuggled out of house arrest by a private se", "url": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/01/02/national/crime-legal/carlos-ghosn-met-lebanese-president-fleeing-japan-sources/", "site_name": "The Japan Times", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/n-ghosnster-a-20200103-870x580.jpg", "width": 870, "height": 580}}, "fb": {"app_id": 119406745111}, "DC.date.issued": "2020-01-02T03:14:34+09:00"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/01/02/national/crime-legal/carlos-ghosn-met-lebanese-president-fleeing-japan-sources/"}
