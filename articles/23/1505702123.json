The former defence minister is the most viable candidate to become the SP\u00d6\u2019s new leader, though he repeatedly denied any ambitions in that regard.\n\nBut even if he stays in Burgenland, his victory could bring a shift in the party\u2019s strategy nonetheless. Doskozil, a leading figure on the SP\u00d6\u2019s right, has a tougher stance on migration than the current SP\u00d6 leadership.\n\nIn Burgenland, he has previously led the sole state-level coalition (at the time) between the SP\u00d6 and the far-right FP\u00d6.\n\nThis could mean that the party may now consider a shift to the right on matters related to security and migration.
