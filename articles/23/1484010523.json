Atlanta\u2019s price gain was the fourth-largest increase, behind only Phoenix, Tampa and Charlotte.\n\nOverall price increases are not as large as they were a few months ago, but there is reason to expect the price hikes to continue or even grow in 2020, said economist Matthew Speakman of Zillow, a Seattle-based source of real estate data, primarily for consumers.\n\nA strong job market and low interest rates have combined to boost home buying, he said. \u201cDespite recent upticks, mortgage rates remain nearly a full percentage point below where they were this time last year.\u201d\n\nDemographics might fuel demand too. Millennials are more likely than previous generations to be renters, but now they are aging into careers and families. A shift to home buying could give the market a jolt.\n\nBut the catch \u2013 especially in Atlanta \u2013 is a shallow pool of homes for sale in price ranges appealing to first-time buyers. That shortage gives sellers an advantage in negotiations, which generally means rising prices.\n\n\u201cThat extreme shortage of for-sale listings, particularly at lower price points, remains a concern,\u201d Speakman said.\n\nSince the housing market bottomed in 2012, metro Atlanta home prices have risen 81.5%, according to Case-Shiller. That index differs somewhat from other measures, since it tracks only resales and does not include data on new home construction.\n\nThose resales counted by Case-Shiller account for the vast majority of home sales, especially in metro Atlanta, where new construction still represents less than half of pre-recession levels.\n\nAtlanta\u2019s current prices are 13.7% higher than the pre-recession peak of 2007, according to Case-Shiller.\n\nOf course, what is a problem for some is a plus for others, said Bill Banfield, executive vice president of Quicken Loans.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining to this month\u2019s increase in home price is homebuyers will see continued appreciating value in their home after the transaction,\u201d he said.\n\nSupport real journalism.
