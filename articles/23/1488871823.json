Jim Acklin on fire last year while deputies were attempting to arrest Brannon on a felony warrant.\n\n\n\nBrannon wiped away tears during the hearing as did members of the sheriff\u2019s office who filled nearly the entire front row of Judge Becky Doherty\u2019s courtroom. Acklin attended the hearing with his wife, Josee Acklin, who works for the Streetsboro Police Department, Portage County Sheriff David Doak and Portage County Major Larry Limbert, as well as other Portage County sheriff deputies.\n\n\n\nNeither Brannon nor Acklin spoke during Tuesday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\n\nBrannon pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated murder, a first-degree felony; aggravated arson, a first-degree felony; and felonious assault, a first-degree felony; all related to the February 2019 incident. He also pleaded guilty to forgery, a fifth-degree felony, from a separate case in a Jan 4, 2019 incident.\n\n\n\nPortage County Assistant Prosecutor Steve Michniak said the plea negotiations include a joint recommendation from both the defense attorneys and the prosecutors that Brannon serve 16 years in prison. The recommendation does not mean that Brannon will get the sentence recommended, but often judges sentence based on a joint recommendation to which both parties agree.\n\n\n\nOn Feb. 14, 2019, three deputies, including Acklin, and two officers from the Northeast Ohio Medical University were serving felony warrants on Brannon about 6:43 p.m. after a source told them Brannon was at a Rootstown Township home on Route 44. Brannon threw a canister of flammable liquid at Acklin and set it on fire, burning about 20 percent of Acklin\u2019s body. Acklin had second and third-degree burns and was hospitalized. Other officers were also injured, though not as badly as Acklin.\n\n\n\nAcklin joined the sheriff\u2019s office in 1997 and was promoted to sergeant in 2017.\n\n\n\nDoak told the Record-Courier at the time of the incident Brannon threatened he was going to \"kill the cops\" when confronted by officers inside the garage.\n\n\n\nOne of Brannon\u2019s attorneys, Erik Jones, thanked the Portage County Sheriff\u2019s Office for allowing Brannon to have a private conversation with his parents while Brannon was being held in jail during the plea negotiations.\n\n\n\nSentencing is set for Monday at 1 p.m.\n\n\n\nContact reporter Eileen McClory at 330-298-1128, emcclory@recordpub.com or @Eileen_McClory.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Eileen Mcclory Reporter"], "publish_date": "Tue Jan  7 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "During an emotional hearing Tuesday, Jay Brannon, 45, of Atwater, pleaded guilty to setting Portage County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt.
