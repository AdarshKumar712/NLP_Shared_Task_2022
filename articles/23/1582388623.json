Authorities believe the 43-year-old gunman had a far-right motive for the killing.\n\nA poll released on Sunday in Bild am Sonntag found that 60% of respondents agreed that the AfD is partly responsible for right-wing extremist violence in the country.\n\nThe Greens have attributed their score to young voters. Figures by infratest dimap showed over a third of voters under the age of 44 had cast their vote for the Green Party.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Regional elections", "Angela Merkel", "Greens", "Alternative for Germany"], "tags": ["Regional elections", "US politics", "Science", "news", "Alternative for Germany", "World News", "Angela Merkel", "Coronavirus", "Carnival", "Technology", "Donald Trump", "Greens"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sun Feb 23 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) may be out of the Hamburg state legislature after failing to gather the required 5% of votes.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"description": "The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) may be out of the Hamburg state legislature after failing to gather the required 5% of votes.", "keywords": "Regional elections,Angela Merkel,Greens,Alternative for Germany", "date.created": "2020-02-23 21:02:25", "date.available": "2020-02-23 21:02:25", "date.updated": "2020-02-23 21:02:28", "date.modified": "2020-02-23 21:02:28", "article": {"theme": "europe", "published_time": "2020-02-23 21:02:25", "modified_time": "2020-02-23 21:02:28", "section": "european-affairs_europe", "author": "Alice Tidey"}, "program.url": "web-digital-stories", "robots": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:standard", "news_keywords": "Regional elections,Angela Merkel,Greens,Alternative for Germany", "og": {"locale": {"identifier": "en-GB", "alternate": "en-GB"}, "site_name": "euronews", "url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/23/hamburg-election-greens-make-major-gains-afd-support-falls", "type": "article", "title": "Hamburg election: Greens make major gains, AfD support falls", "description": "The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) may be out of the Hamburg state legislature after failing to gather the required 5% of votes.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/52/29/84/1000x563_cmsv2_41f392c8-ccc9-598e-81bf-893e7b43f5e9-4522984.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "type": "image/jpeg", "alt": "Hamburg election: Greens make major gains, AfD support falls"}}, "twitter": {"site": "@euronews", "title": "Hamburg election: Greens make major gains, AfD support falls", "description": "The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) may be out of the Hamburg state legislature after failing to gather the required 5% of votes.", "image": {"alt": "Hamburg election: Greens make major gains, AfD support falls"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "images0": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/52/29/84/1000x563_cmsv2_41f392c8-ccc9-598e-81bf-893e7b43f5e9-4522984.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 101402598109}, "sponsored": "no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#003865", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Euronews.com", "application-name": "Euronews.com", "msapplication-config": "browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-tooltip": "Euronews.com", "msapplication-window": "width=1280;height=1024", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#003865", "msapplication-starturl": "./", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/mstile-small.jpg", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/mstile-medium.jpg", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/mstile-wide.jpg", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/mstile-large.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1", "mobile-web-app-capable": "no"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/23/hamburg-election-greens-make-major-gains-afd-support-falls"}
