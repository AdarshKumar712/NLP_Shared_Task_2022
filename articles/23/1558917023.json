Suspending elective surgeries will free up those doctors, other medical personnel, and rooms and equipment.\"\n\nDr. Sathya is also concerned about the effect that doing elective surgeries is bound to have on medical staff. \"Because of the number of healthcare workers required to work close to one another for each surgery,\" he writes, \"I have no doubt that continuing to perform non-urgent surgeries would lead to further spread of the virus among healthcare workers.\"\n\nIn other words, those who are pushing for abortions during the coronavirus are endangering the lives of healthcare workers.\n\nBut do they care?\n\nHere is how Planned Parenthood has responded. \"We're closely monitoring the spread of the new cononavirus, or COVID-19. The health and safety of our patients, staff, and communities is our top priority.\"\n\nNotice that Planned Parenthood is only interested in its own agenda.\n\nIt says not a word about tying up resources needed by those who are truly sick.\n\nBy taking away needed personnel, gear, and equipment from servicing those who are infected with the coronavirus, it is jeopardizing the lives of those at risk.\n\nThe heart of this dispute rests on the question of whether abortion is elective surgery or not. Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and others in the abortion industry argue that abortion is not elective surgery and must be provided at all times.\n\nBut is it?\n\nTake two women, Joy and Jane. Joy has a life-threatening heart problem and is scheduled for surgery. Jane wants an abortion. No one in his right mind would equate the two. If Joy doesn\u2019t get heart surgery, she will probably die. If Jane is denied her abortion, she lives (as does her baby).\n\nIt comes down to this: Joy has a need; Jane has a want. No woman wants to have heart surgery \u2014 they either need it or they don't.\n\nConversely, no woman needs an abortion \u2014 it is, as they like to say, a matter of choice.\n\nDoes that mean that abortion is like any other elective surgery, such as a facelift (rhytidectomy) or a tummy tuck (abdominoplasty)?\n\nNo. In those cases, only the person's face or tummy is affected. In the case of an abortion, another person is affected. And there is nothing elective about that person's fate.\n\nDr. William Donohue is the president and CEO of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights.
