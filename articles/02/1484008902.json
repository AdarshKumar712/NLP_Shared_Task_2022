Forced to dig out cars twice, Fargo mobile home park residents frustrated with new management\n\nTwice in two days, plows buried Scott Lanning's car in a pile of snow next to his mobile home in Countryside Trailer Court.\n\n\u201cThis was all cleared out, and they came back and pushed it all back in,\u201d Lanning said Tuesday, Dec. 31.\n\nMany other Countryside residents have struggled with the same problem since the weekend blizzard dumped about a foot of snow on Fargo, leaving them angry, late for work, and asking why.\n\nIn previous years, a skid-steer loader was used to clear snow in the south Fargo mobile home park, which made it easier for residents to access their vehicles. But this year, new management has used V-shaped plows to clear streets in the park, burying cars in the process.\n\nlisten live watch live\n\nMore from The Forum's C.S.

Leaked list shows UND's Kennedy selected over more experienced candidates for Colorado job\n\n\n\nFormer University of North Dakota President Mark Kennedy beat out dozens of candidates with impressive resumes for the University of Colorado presidency, including Mitt Romney's lieutenant governor, a former secretary of the U.S. Air Force and his own replacement.\n\nThe names of the applicants were revealed Tuesday when the Colorado Independent published a leaked list. The Independent said the list of 30 names was authenticated by the lawyer for the University of Colorado Board of Regents.\n\nThe list was released following controversy over Kennedy's status as the lone finalist for the position before he was hired. Many saw his winning the position as a political move, which led to calls for the list to be released.\n\nMore from Forum News Service's Sydney Mook\n\n3. After DHS overpays $9 million across state, Clay County says they won't pay back their share\n\n\n\nIn November, counties across Minnesota were notified by the Minnesota Department of Human Services that DHS had overpaid them for certain services and the agency wanted the money back.\n\nThe amount DHS is seeking from counties is nearly $9 million.\n\nHowever, the Association of Minnesota Counties is recommending counties let DHS officials know they plan to keep the money they received. On Tuesday, Dec. 31, the Clay County Commission did just that.\n\nCommissioners unanimously voted to authorize that a letter be sent to the state saying the county did not intend to pay the approximately $118,000 DHS was billing it for.\n\nMore from The Forum's Dave Olson\n\n4.

Previous ads have featured Duhamel strolling through downtown Fargo, biking the Maah Daah Hey Trail and hiking in the state's top tourist destination, the Theodore Roosevelt National Park.\n\nRead more from Forum News Service's Jeremy Turley\n\n5.
