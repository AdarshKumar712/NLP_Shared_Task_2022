They started 2-0-1 and followed that with close losses to the Chiefs and Packers, both of which were games that could have gone either way. Despite the losses, there was hope that by showing they can play with two of NFL\u2019s best teams that they could certainly compete for a playoff spot.\n\nBut with Matthew Stafford missing the whole second half of the season, they lost their last nine games finishing 3-12-1 and have the third overall selection in the draft. Looking at their roster it is pretty clear to me that the Detroit Lions must use the draft to rebuild their defense.\n\nThe offense has a pretty solid offensive line, a young, talented running back in Kerryon Johnson, last year\u2019s first-round tight end T.J. Hockenson, and one of the best receivers in the league, Kenny Golladay.\n\nIn the seven games this season with Stafford under center, Detroit averaged 25.5 points per game, which would of finished top 10 in the NFL. If he can stay healthy, this can certainly be a good offense for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe defense meanwhile has holes all over the place. They have massive needs at cornerback, linebacker and on the interior of the defensive line. Finding players at these positions without reaching will be the key for the Detroit Lions in the draft.\n\nThe Lions do not have any extra picks, they just have their own picks for the first through sixth rounds. They did trade their seventh-round pick to the 49ers for Eli Harold.\n\nSo, without further ado, here is a projection of what the Detroit Lions will do with their six picks in April\u2019s draft.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Justin Rochat", "Sayre Bedinger", "Gary Davenport", "Dan Schmelzer", "Jacob Schyvinck"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "What an ugly season for the Detroit Lions.
