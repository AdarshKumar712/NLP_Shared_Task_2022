Disposable plastic gloves, used tissues and face masks had also been spotted on roadsides and pavements.\n\nThe trust is asking people to take even more care with their litter at this time to ensure they take it home with them and to ensure that they are not exposing those who pick up the litter to additional risk from the virus.\n\nHead of engagement Sandy Middleton said: \u201cThe vast majority of people in Shetland do take their litter home with them and we have seen nothing like the scenes on the mainland where country parks and beaches have been strewn with litter, bottles, disposable cups and more.\n\n\u201cThere have been a number of reports over the weekend, however, of increased littering which is very sad.\n\n\u201cPeople in Shetland really value their beautiful environment and a growing number of people are picking up litter when out for their daily walks and they continue to clean up their local beaches.\n\n\u201cIt is great to see people taking such pride in their surroundings but unfortunately every bit of litter they collect may carry an invisible risk \u2013 no matter what it is.\u201d\n\nPeople who do pick up litter are asked to take extra care and to wear gloves, use litter pickers if they have them, and of course to wash their hands.\n\nMs Middleton added: \u201cFor those who continue to drop litter and to leave their dog poo bags behind, you are asked to take it home with you and stop ruining our environment and putting those who care for it at risk.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Shetland Amenity Trust", "Sandy Middleton", "Da Voar Redd Up"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jun  3 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.shetlandtimes.co.uk/wp-content/themes/shetland-times-2019/img/apple-touch-icon.png?v=2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Shetland Times", "application-name": "Shetland Times", "msapplication-TileColor": "#005cad", "theme-color": "#005cad", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Take your bruck home with you, amenity trust warns - The Shetland Times", "description": "People are being encouraged, now more than ever, to take their litter home with them.", "url": "https://www.shetlandtimes.co.uk/2020/06/03/take-your-bruck-home-with-you-amenity-trust-warns", "site_name": "The Shetland Times", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.shetlandtimes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bruck-at-Spiggie-e1591173593361.jpg", "width": 659, "height": 441}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/shetlandtimes", "published_time": "2020-06-03T08:43:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@shetlandtimes", "site": "@shetlandtimes"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.shetlandtimes.co.uk/2020/06/03/take-your-bruck-home-with-you-amenity-trust-warns"}
