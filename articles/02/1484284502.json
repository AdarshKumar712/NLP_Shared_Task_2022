The border question is yet to be settled. However, we have made a lot of progress in maintaining peace and tranquillity along the borders,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cI am sure that the situation will prevail. And by maintaining peace and tranquillity along the borders, we will be able to set the stage for an eventual solution,\u201d he added.\n\nThe India-China border dispute covers 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.\n\nBoth sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.\n\n\u201cWhile we have been giving attention in the past to our western front (border with Pakistan), the northern front also requires equal amount of attention. And it is in that context we are now going to enhance our capacities along the northern border,\u201d Gen Naravane said. \u2013 PTI", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ti Trade"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"Author": "TI Trade", "GENERATOR": "Microsoft FrontPage 5.0", "KeyWords": "Military capabilities to be bolstered along China border"}, "canonical_link": ""}
