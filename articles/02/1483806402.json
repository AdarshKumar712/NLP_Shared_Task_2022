And for the first time, many Americans found daily living was no longer a difficult chore but actually cutting edge, convenient and fun.\n\nIn the end, however, a decade of \u201cpedal to the metal\u201d living and constant demands to push the limits drove Western society right into the middle of its worst nightmare \u2014 the Great Depression, which became another historical decade on its own merits.\n\nOpportunity to do better\n\nAnd so here we are at the front end of a pristine new 20s. Whether we refer to our new decade as the \u201ctwenties\u201d or the \u201ctwenty-twenties,\u201d we have been handed the opportunity to blaze a new, yet healthier, path by learning from the past.\n\nWhat will history write about the 2020s one day? What statement will we make? How will we be branded?\n\nWe truly can shake off the past, let go of whatever is holding us back and make this our decade. Why not make it our goal to see and live with the clarity of 20/20 vision in the decade of the 2020s?\n\nTime to reboot\n\nTo have an opportunity at even coming close to that goal, it will require an official reboot of our lives by flushing out all the chaos and clutter. Just like a computer needs to be restarted from time to time to clear its brains, so to speak, we need to do the same.\n\nIt might be as simple as seriously reviewing the overload of responsibilities we\u2019ve found ourselves juggling to determine which are vital and which can or should be removed.\n\nIt could be working through unresolved conflict with someone or letting go of bitterness we\u2019ve been harboring or maybe even finding a way to forgive a person who hurt us.\n\nIt may mean forgiving ourselves and finding a way to let go of the guilt and shame and give it to God. He truly will carry us and the load we bring.\n\nMaybe there\u2019s some sin hiding in the crevices of our hearts that needs to be brought to the light. The peace, freedom and release that comes from fully repenting of our sin is definitely the way to launch a new year with confidence and gusto.\n\nCan you imagine the impact we can make for Christ if each of us, as individuals, would truly renew our lives, let go of the past while learning from it and forge ahead with fresh energy and unrelenting urgency?\n\nEditor\u2019s Note \u2014 This opinion piece by Jennifer Davis Rash will appear in the Jan. 2 issue of The Alabama Baptist newspaper on the \u201cMy Rashionale\u201d editorial page.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 07:17:32 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thealabamabaptist.org/wp-content/themes/thealabap/assets/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "amBtyPLcX6BV6rIGDW_cAHjF_RXZsx6aCO0FM5ACmW0", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "What will history write about our version of the 20s? - The Alabama Baptist", "description": "By Jennifer Davis Rash The Alabama Baptist Old things become new again \u2014 at least that\u2019s how the traditional saying goes, right?
