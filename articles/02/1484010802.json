Nine! Liberate Hong Kong, revolution now!\u201d as they lit up their phones in a sea of lights.\n\nSmaller crowds of protesters in the Mong Kok district set fire to barricades, before riot police unleashed 2020\u2019s first volleys of teargas in response.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators light up their phones to mark the new year in Hong Kong.

Hopefully a huge turnout at tomorrow\u2019s march could bring back people\u2019s passion,\u201d he added.\n\nThe city\u2019s traditional New Year Eve\u2019s bumper fireworks display was cancelled due to safety concerns, but a light show and smaller-scale fireworks took place instead.\n\nIn late November, the city\u2019s pro-democracy camp scored a landslide victory in a municipal-level vote seen as a referendum on the Beijing-backed government\u2019s handling of political unrest.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man is detained by riot police in Mongkok.

In 2020, I really hope it will be a better year for all Hong Kong people.\u201d\n\nThe Civil Human Rights Front, the chief organiser of marches, hopes for a huge turnout at Wednesday\u2019s rally to urge the government to respond to the demands of the pro-democracy movement - which include an independent inquiry into the police, amnesty for arrestees and fully free elections.\n\nPolice have arrested nearly 6,500 people since June - nearly a third of them aged under 20.\n\n\u201cThe youngsters have sacrificed a lot for justice... 2019 is a wake-up call,\u201d a 63-year-old retiree, who gave his surname as Shiu, told AFP.\n\n\u201cPeople will be more determined in the new year. People know that the future of Hong Kong depends on whether we can achieve the five demands.\u201d\n\nThe demonstrations were sparked by a now-abandoned bill to allow extraditions to the authoritarian mainland, but have since morphed into a popular revolt against Beijing\u2019s control - the biggest crisis since the former British colony\u2019s return to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\n\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Hong Kong", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Protest"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Authorities responded quickly after activists set fire to barricades as city prepares for a huge march on New Year\u2019s Day", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/fee5e2d638d1c35f6d501fa397e53329/152x152.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Authorities responded quickly after activists set fire to barricades as city prepares for a huge march on New Year\u2019s Day", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/745bb051491116c08c50ddaa0c9df98192e39c69/0_101_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae363bbf487f12a77dac03bcf57fbb88", "keywords": "Hong Kong,China,Asia Pacific,Protest", "news_keywords": "Hong Kong,China,Asia Pacific,Protest", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/01/hong-kong-police-fire-teargas-amid-new-years-eve-protests", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/745bb051491116c08c50ddaa0c9df98192e39c69/0_101_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c32310296b4d549d4b7f6160c9654be6", "description": "Authorities responded quickly after activists set fire to barricades as city prepares for a huge march on New Year\u2019s Day", "type": "article", "title": "Hong Kong police fire teargas amid New Year's Eve protests", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "Agence France-Presse", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "World news", "published_time": "2020-01-01T01:58:12.000Z", "tag": "Hong Kong,China,Asia Pacific,Protest", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T01:58:14.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/01/hong-kong-police-fire-teargas-amid-new-years-eve-protests?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/01/hong-kong-police-fire-teargas-amid-new-years-eve-protests?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/01/hong-kong-police-fire-teargas-amid-new-years-eve-protests", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/01/hong-kong-police-fire-teargas-amid-new-years-eve-protests?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/745bb051491116c08c50ddaa0c9df98192e39c69/0_101_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=24153c3d081e092e278ec5435481ae79", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/01/hong-kong-police-fire-teargas-amid-new-years-eve-protests"}
