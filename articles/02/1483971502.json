It wouldn\u2019t last very long. Do I want to? No. I want to have peace. I like peace. And Iran should want peace more than anybody. So I don\u2019t see that happening. No, I don\u2019t think Iran would want that to happen. It would go very quickly,\u201d Trump told reporters before a New Year\u2019s Eve celebration at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nThe Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of mainly Shiite-aligned militias, including Kataib Hezbollah, called on its supporters to move away from the compound after the Iraqi government said their \u201cmessage has been heard.\u201d\n\nMohammed Mohieh, a spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, said the group\u2019s members would not budge until the US ambassador is removed and US troops leave Iraq.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said the US would deploy about 750 troops to the Middle East in response to the storming of the embassy.\n\n\u201cThis deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against US personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad today,\u201d Esper said in a statement. \u201cThe United States will protect our people and interests anywhere they are found around the world.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["News", "baghdad", "iran", "iraq", "military", "us embassy"], "tags": ["military", "iran", "iraq", "us embassy", "baghdad"], "authors": ["January"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "US troops on Wednesday fired tear gas and rubber bullets at hundreds of pro-Iranian militia members who hurled rocks at the US Embassy as a tense standoff in Baghdad entered its second day.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/nypost-2016/static/images/apple-icons/nypost/apple-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
