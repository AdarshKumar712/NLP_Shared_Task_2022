Just like a sleeping baby, there\u2019s just something angelic about watching a dog sleep. Just as every parent knows, no matter how mischievous their child has been, once they fall asleep all is forgotten and they are reminded what angels they really are. Dog owners feel the same, their precious pup sleeping just brings on feelings of peace and melts away anxiety.\n\nBut have you ever noticed the varying sleep positions a dog will lay in? Sometimes they are curled all up and others stretched way out for the world to see them. Turns out, these sleeping positions can have different meanings, and they are all quite interesting to get an inside look into what they may be feeling.\n\n1) The Donut\n\nDon\u2019t dogs just look so adorable all curled up like a donut sleeping? Well, it turns out the sleeping position can mean your precious pooch is trying to conserve body heat and protect the most vulnerable parts of its body. Out in the wild this is the most common sleeping position among animals because for them too it conserves warmth and protects their vital organ. Usually you will see a dog sleep this way in the winter \u2013 but it\u2019s not anything to worry about. It\u2019s just a cozy and comfortable way for them to sleep.\n\n2) On Their Backs\n\nThere could be two reasons a dog might sleep on their backs. First, it looks just too cute when they do, but it could mean they are feeling too hot so they get in this position to cool down. The belly of a dog has thinner fur and also their paws hold sweat glands. In this position it\u2019s the best way to diminish some extra heat. Another reason a pooch might sleep this way is an indication he\u2019s very comfortable with his surroundings. When dogs are willing to reveal their bellies, it\u2019s a sign of submission and vulnerability. It shows they are relaxed in their surroundings and feels trust and comfort from you.\n\n3) The Cuddle Bug\n\nThe sweet reason a dog might sleep like a little cuddle bug goes back to when they were puppies. Sleeping back to back helped the newborns to regulate their body temperature. As the puppy matures it still is habit for them and is an instinctual way for them to show you in their minds you are part of their \u201cpack\u201d and they trust you.\n\n4) The Superman\n\nIt always brings a smile to see a dog sprawled out with its limbs stretched forward while laying on its stomach as if he were flying through the air like Superman. But have you ever noticed they only sleep like this during the day? This is because it\u2019s the best position for a dog to quickly get on its feet and is willing to play at the drop of a hat.\n\n5) Side Sleeping\n\nThis one will melt your heart. The typical dog that sleeps on its side is doing so to show its affection and to share a close bond with their owners. It shows the pup has no worries in life and is relaxed and comfortable in its surroundings.\n\n6) The Lion Pose\n\nDogs will get into this position at times when they still have a considerable amount of energy and they don\u2019t feel like sleeping. This way they can easily get up and play if the opportunity arises for them. It also is a position that will relieve the dog of stress and make them feel more comfortable.\n\n7) Laying On Your Clothes\n\nThough it may not come all that appreciated especially if you have a high shedding dog, the sweet reason a dog does this is to show its love. Your clothing has your scent on it and your dog just wants to feel closer to you.\n\n8) Circling And Digging\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen the dog circle and dig around as if trying to get their \u201cbed\u201d as comfortable as possible. This is an instinctual thing as dogs are knowb to trample down the grass to get their spot as comfortable as they possibly can.\n\nNext time your pooch goes to sleep, now you will know a little bit more of what\u2019s going on in his mind.\n\nCheck out the video below for more explanation into the fascinating reasons dogs choose a certain sleeping position.\n\nPlease SHARE this with your friends and family.\n\nArticle Sources: YouTube To learn more read our Editorial Standards\n\nShare this article", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 14:28:49 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/sbly-media/assets/img/logos/profile_animal_32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 461432517330047, "pages": 806049016161329}, "article": {"author": "animalchannelbysbly", "publisher": "animalchannelbysbly", "tag": "sleeping", "section": "Dogs", "published_time": "2020-01-01T14:28:49-08:00"}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "8 sleeping positions that explain dogs\u2019 health and feelings", "description": "Also gives insight into their character.", "url": "https://animalchannel.co/dogs-sleeping-positions-meaning/", "site_name": "Animal Channel", "image": {"identifier": "https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31174929/dogs-sleeping.jpg", "secure_url": "https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31174929/dogs-sleeping.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Also gives insight into their character.", "title": "8 sleeping positions that explain dogs\u2019 health and feelings", "site": "@shareably", "image": "https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31174929/dogs-sleeping.jpg", "creator": "@shareably"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.7.2"}, "canonical_link": "https://animalchannel.co/dogs-sleeping-positions-meaning/"}
