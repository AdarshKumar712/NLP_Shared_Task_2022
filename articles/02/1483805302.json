for visitors to Dudley Zoo to get to know as they make they way around the enclosures.\n\nKicking off the year was the arrival of an Egyptian fruit bat in January who was the first of seven bats to born in its indoor Castle Creatures exhibit.\n\nIn February there were celebrations in the Small Primate House when keepers welcomed critically endangered black and white ruffed lemur twins, Pandora and Prometheus.\n\nAnd March was another brilliant month for primates with the birth of a pygmy marmoset, twin ring-tailed lemurs, Spider and Loki and gelada Jinka. Plus, the zoo also welcomed two baby Patagonian mara and three Barbary sheep.\n\nBaby penguin at Dudley Zoo\n\nApril heralded the arrival of Primrose, another critically endangered black and white ruffed lemur, four guinea pigs were born on Easter Day, there was another Patagonian mara, plus Nuno the Humboldt penguin, who was named after the Wolves Manager.\n\nIn May, tiny Harvest mice were born in the farm barn.\n\nAdvertising\n\nBaby camel\n\nThere were more celebrations on the farm in June when staff welcomed Bactrian camel, Delilah to the zoo family.\n\nJuly saw the birth of two meerkat pups, who didn\u2019t make their public debut outside until a month later.\n\nDuring August Oakley the Bactrian camel arrived, alongside Toby, the Standing\u2019s Day gecko in the Reptile House and another Patagonian mara.\n\nAdvertising\n\nSeptember saw the notable birth of Kira, the zoo's female giraffe calf, Maximus the Burrowing owl hatched and staff welcomed their ninth yellow-breasted capuchin too, another little boy, who has been named Deet.\n\nAnd little Shire, the second male gelada of the year arrived in October.\n\nThree endangered dhole pups have been born at West Midland Safari Park.\n\nCurator Richard Brown, said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted with our new arrivals, who are all making fantastic progress, as they're living proof of the continued success of our international conservation programmes with some of the rarest species in the world, so why not come and visit them in 2020 to see how much they\u2019ve grown.\"\n\nKeepers at West Midland Safari Park have also had many reasons to celebrate this year.\n\nIn March, three boisterous, endangered dhole (Asiatic wild dog) pups were born but keepers didn't meet them pups face-to-face until they were 10 weeks old as they were kept hidden away in their den by seven-year-old mum, Berri.\n\nLuckily, staff were alerted to the pups\u2019 appearance when they noticed some tiny, wriggling fluff-balls, being carefully washed by their dad, Douglas, on the dhole house CCTV.\n\nLike a domestic puppy, the dhole pups had their first veterinary check, microchips and vaccinations at ten weeks old. This also gave staff the chance to see what gender the pups were too \u2013 two boys and a girl.\n\nOn the morning of March 13, keepers were astonished to find that the Park\u2019s pair of grey-handed douroucouli, also known as night monkeys or owl monkeys, had given birth to a tiny baby.\n\nA tiny baby douroucouli has been born at West Midland Safari Park.\n\nThe appearance of the minute monkey came as a complete surprise to keepers, as they had no idea that mum, eight-year-old Kyna, was pregnant. Baby douroucouli only weigh a miniscule 3oz at birth, so although the adults are weighed weekly, there was no indication that Kyna was carrying a small passenger\n\nIn June here were smiles all round when three tiny, cute and incredibly fluffy chinchilla babies made their first appearance.\n\nThe long-tailed chinchilla youngsters, known as \u2018kits\u2019 were born to first-time parents, Gladys and Julian, who can normally be seen in the park\u2019s Friendly Animal Encounters and Safari Academy classroom sessions.\n\nKeepers suspected that Gladys may have been pregnant as she was putting on a lot of weight, as discovered in her weekly health checks. After they had alerted the Park\u2019s veterinary team to their suspicions, the vet confirmed Gladys was pregnant and promptly put her on \u2018maternity leave\u2019.\n\nDuring their afternoon rounds on June 1, keepers were excited to find the three tiny balls of fluff, no bigger than a ping pong ball, cuddled up with their mum.\n\nThe same month two fluffy, grey Humboldt penguin chicks also emerged from their nests , under the watchful eyes of their parents \u2013 pairs Elm and Elder and Ash and Juniper.\n\nThree tiny, endangered chinchilla babies have been born at West Midland Safari Park\n\nAll babies born at the park during 2019 have names beginning with the letter \u2018H\u2019 and the penguin keepers went for a food theme and named the chicks \u2018Hotdog\u2019 and \u2018Haggis\n\nIn July they welcomed the arrival of a critically endangered teeny-tiny pancake tortoise.\n\nAfter hatching from its egg, the miniscule youngster, named Hartley, was about the size of a bottle-top, which was reused as a water bowl for the tiny hatchling.\n\nHartley is the second success of the park\u2019s breeding programme for pancake tortoises, following the hatching of older half-brother Finn, who became an internet sensation in 2017, due to his minute size.\n\nDeputy head keeper of the Discovery Trail, Steve Slater, said: \u201cWhen Finn, our first baby pancake tortoise, hatched in 2017, the conservation status of his species was classed as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Since then, the IUCN have reviewed the status and have found that the population of the species is drastically declining, so now list the species as \u2018critically endangered\u2019.\u201d\n\nTwelve baby skunks were been born at Telford Exotic Zoo\n\nA dozen baby skunks have been settling in to their new home after being welcomed into the world at Telford\u2019s Exotic Zoo over the summer.\n\nThe kits, which are black, brown and albino, proved a big a hit with visitors.\n\nVisitors got a nice surprise when a pair of baby Patagonian maras came into the world before their very eyes.\n\nStaff at the popular attraction in Priorslee had no idea their mother was pregnant but have warmly welcomed the new arrivals.\n\nThe zoo may have become the first in the UK to successfully breed black widow spiders \u2013 welcoming between 100 and 200 of the tiny creatures just in time for Halloween.\n\nBut as well as the thrill of seeing the infamous creatures up close, The zoo\u2019s owner Scott Adams says he\u2019s hoping people take the time to learn more about these often misunderstood spiders.\n\nVisitors to a Chester Zoo were buzzing with delight following the arrival of three cute rock hyrax pups.\n\nRock hyrax pups at Chester Zoo\n\nThe triplets - two female pups and their brother - were born to parents Daissie and Nungud on July 18.\n\nThe mini mammals weighed no more than a banana at about 250 grams.\n\nKeepers also celebrated the birth of Chester Zoo\u2019s first dusky pademelon \u2013 a rare \u2018miniature kangaroo\u2019 from Indonesia.\n\nThe adorable joey started to peek out from the pouch of first-time mother Styx after being born earlier in the spring. Dusky pademelons, also known as dusky wallabies, are small, hopping marsupials found in forests on the island of New Guinea, as well as some neighbouring islands.\n\nFive endangered ring-tailed lemurs were also among the new arrivals Zoo, as well as one rare black lemur, the first to be born there.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Heather Large"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Animal keepers have been kept busy thanks to a baby boom which has seen the arrival of many new mouths to feed.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/pb/resources/favicon-ss.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "yWCTiyLf9BaHioy1C814rtmhN_XsUZzU-JwlBVPEAbI", "og": {"url": "https://www.shropshirestar.com/entertainment/attractions/2020/01/01/baby-love-as-midlands-zoos-celebrate-new-arrivals/", "type": "article", "title": "GALLERY: Baby love as zoos celebrate new arrivals", "description": "Animal keepers have been kept busy thanks to a baby boom which has seen the arrival of many new mouths to feed.", "image": "https://www.shropshirestar.com/resizer/qeITqARWT-3k-ek1ZI7GHUaUjlU=/1200x0/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-shropshirestar-mna.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Z2BKKXXSQJHYBMAKI5HURUSNIU.jpg"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://www.shropshirestar.com/resizer/qeITqARWT-3k-ek1ZI7GHUaUjlU=/1200x0/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-shropshirestar-mna.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Z2BKKXXSQJHYBMAKI5HURUSNIU.jpg", "site": "ShropshireStar", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "GALLERY: Baby love as zoos celebrate new arrivals", "description": "Animal keepers have been kept busy thanks to a baby boom which has seen the arrival of many new mouths to feed."}, "pb": {"page-type": "story"}, "fb": {"app_id": 125556724129189}, "description": "Animal keepers have been kept busy thanks to a baby boom which has seen the arrival of many new mouths to feed.", "author": "Heather Large", "pb-site": "/entertainment/attractions", "story": {"": {"premium-flag": "Free"}}, "dfp": {"page-type": "story", "slot": "/entertainment/attractions", "story": "[\"KER6V74JHFCTNJRI7FUNV327VA\",\"/entertainment/attractions/2020/01/01/baby-love-as-midlands-zoos-celebrate-new-arrivals/\"]", "sites": "[\"/entertainment/attractions\",\"/entertainment\",\"/entertainment\",\"/entertainment/telford-entertainment\",\"/entertainment\",\"/news/local-hubs/telford\",\"/news\",\"/news/local-hubs\",\"/news/local-hubs\",\"/news\",\"/news\",\"/news/trending-topics/editors-picks\",\"/news\",\"/news/trending-topics\",\"/news/trending-topics\",\"/news\",\"/top-stories/homepage\",\"/top-stories\",\"/top-stories\"]"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.shropshirestar.com/entertainment/attractions/2020/01/01/baby-love-as-midlands-zoos-celebrate-new-arrivals/"}
