This new practice of tripping and removing our public officers through contrived CCT ex-parte orders corrodes confidence in the system,\u201d Usoro stated.\n\nThe association called on politicians, to turn their attention from politics to governance and development, adding that Nigerians voted in 2019 for improvements in their circumstances, and, in their socio-economic circumstances.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs Nigerians, our strength lies, amongst others, in our resilience and eternal optimism. No matter our circumstances and no matter the temptation, we must not lose those qualities even as we must persist in holding our governments to account.\u201d\n\nThe NBS boss said, \u201c2020 provides us with the opportunity to reposition ourselves for the greater good of our people and our beloved country.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA)"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 15:02:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "NBA has called on politicians to put aside their parochial and selfish interests and ensure that Nigeria remains a united and indissoluble...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/logo.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "NBA has called on politicians to put aside their parochial and selfish interests and ensure that Nigeria remains a united and indissoluble...", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Ensure Nigerians' unity, NBA charges politicians Tribune Online", "description": "NBA has called on politicians to put aside their parochial and selfish interests and ensure that Nigeria remains a united and indissoluble...", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/ensure-nigerians-unity-nba-charges-politicians/", "site_name": "Tribune Online", "image": {"identifier": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PAUL-USORO.jpg", "secure_url": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PAUL-USORO.jpg", "width": 450, "height": 350}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Tribuneonline/", "tag": "The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA)", "section": "Latest News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T15:02:00+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1050738235033475, "pages": 77912203638}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "NBA has called on politicians to put aside their parochial and selfish interests and ensure that Nigeria remains a united and indissoluble...", "title": "Ensure Nigerians' unity, NBA charges politicians Tribune Online", "site": "@nigeriantribune", "image": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PAUL-USORO.jpg", "creator": "@nigeriantribune"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/ensure-nigerians-unity-nba-charges-politicians/?ia_markup=1"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/logo.jpg", "numberOfItems": 3, "itemListOrder": "Ascending"}, "canonical_link": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/ensure-nigerians-unity-nba-charges-politicians/"}
