The whole family gets a fresh start,\u201d said David. \u201cA new beginning,\u201d added Rebecca.\n\nImercyn, who wasn\u2019t due until the 20th, is the couple\u2019s third child \u2013 joining 14-month-old Kieler Jackson Stanley and six-year-old Laylin Rose Stanley.\n\nRebecca says she\u2019s thrilled \u2013 and exhausted.\n\n\u201cTired. But worth it,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a household where sleep may prove hard to come by, some welcome news:\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s pretty content so far,\u201d said Rebecca. \u201cRight after she was born, I took a nap and never even heard her,\u201d added David.\n\nAs for Imercyn\u2019s title of \u2018first of the decade,\u2019 mom and dad say they\u2019ve not given it too much thought.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t even realize it until the hospital came in and asked us if we\u2019d be willing to talk to news crews, and we\u2019re like \u2018for what?\u201d said David. \u201cI guess we were just that tired,\u201d added Rebecca.\n\nThe pair says it\u2019s unofficial at this point, but say doctors suspect Imercyn could be the first baby born not only in this hospital, but in all of southwest Virginia, too.\n\nAn unlikely start to what\u2019s already shaping up to be a pretty happy New Year.\n\nLATEST STORIES:\n\nGet breaking news, weather, and sports delivered to your smartphone with the WFXR News app available on Apple and Android.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ford Carson", "Hayley Henson", "Santiago Melli-Huber"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 04:48:03 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Va.
