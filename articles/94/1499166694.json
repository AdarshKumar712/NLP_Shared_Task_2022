Furthermore, other critical limiting aspects, are the gaps in continental infrastructure - a key cornerstone of fluid systems of trade, according to Mwagiru.\n\nFin24 previously reported that the agreement to implement AfCFTA was only reached in July 2019, following Nigeria's decision to join. If it is fully implemented, 90% of tariffs should be be eliminated in five years. There could be a delay of up to 10 years for least-developed countries. Intra-African trade accounts for only 18% of total African trade. The UN Economic Commission for Africa estimates that AfCFTA's implementation could double intra-African trade by 2030.\n\nTariffs not the only barrier to African Continental Free Trade Agreement - expert\n\nDelegates at the World Economic Forum on Africa in September 2019 also heard that, when it comes to successfully implementing a free trade plan across Africa, it will take more than just having heads of state sign an agreement.\n\nThe first commitments to the agreement were already made by some African countries in March of 2018. At the time President Cyril Ramaphosa said the free trade plan would preset an opportunity to generate growth through trade.\n\n\"The potential for businesses, economies and societies to benefit from this emerging policy environment is exciting, and equally, the challenges remain stark,\" says Mwagiru.\n\n\"The road to combined prosperity heralded by this historical agreement, is riddled with policy potholes, probable political diversions, and operational blind spots that may present notable risks for the journey towards economic integration.\"\n\nThat is why she regards the AfCFTA as an ambitious initiative to unite African economic potential on a joint path towards prosperity, since the aim is to consolidate a market of over 1 billion people, across 55 African states, with a combined GDP of over US$2 tr.\n\n\"The next steps will involve among others, building the policy implementation frameworks, and institutionalising the norms, procedures, and rules of the continental free trade area,\" says Mwagiru.\n\n\"In loosening historical shackles that have tied African economies to benefitting imperialist relations, the AfCFTA is a commendable commitment of African states to boost intra-continental trade and African market growth.\"\n\nUnprecedented challenges to global trade, freight conference hears\n\nAt the same time, she points out that the wide spectrum of economic performance levels across African states is a further challenge on the free trade road, \"with hints that more mature economies will have an advantage over those that are small and less diversified\".\n\n\"The mapped road is riddled with challenges and is not straightforward or smooth. The unfolding steps will reveal whether opportunity can be translated into shared prosperity,\" says Mwagiru.\n\n*", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Breaking Business News", "african", "free trade", "trade"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The African Continental Free Trade Area will test the capacity for African leadership to build consensus in translating policy to practice, a", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.midwestradionetwork.com/web/premier/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Migration, borders a challenge to African free trade - futurist", "description": "The African Continental Free Trade Area will test the capacity for African leadership to build consensus in translating policy to practice, a", "keywords": "Breaking Business News, african, free trade, trade", "news_keywords": "Breaking Business News, african, free trade, trade", "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "1 Day", "og": {"title": "Migration, borders a challenge to African free trade - futurist", "site_name": "Africa Leader", "url": "https://www.africaleader.com/news/263760720/migration-borders-a-challenge-to-african-free-trade---futurist", "description": "The African Continental Free Trade Area will test the capacity for African leadership to build consensus in translating policy to practice, a", "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/n241579441462.jpg", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@africaleader", "title": "Migration, borders a challenge to African free trade - futurist", "description": "The African Continental Free Trade Area will test the capacity for African leadership to build consensus in translating policy to practice, a", "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/n241579441462.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.fin24.com/Economy/migration-borders-a-challenge-to-african-free-trade-futurist-20200119"}
