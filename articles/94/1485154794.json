World\n\nNINE people died after Indonesia\u2019s capital Jakarta was hit by its deadliest flooding in years, authorities said yesterday, as torrential rains on New Year\u2019s Eve left vast swathes of the megalopolis submerged.\n\nElectricity was switched off in hundreds of waterlogged neighborhoods across greater Jakarta, home to about 30 million people, with some train lines and one of the city\u2019s airports also shut.\n\nA 16-year-old was electrocuted by a power line, while three people died of hypothermia, Jakarta disaster management agency head Subejo said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that the floodwaters will recede but if the rain keeps up, it\u2019ll continue,\u201d said the official, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.\n\nAmong the victims was an old couple trapped inside their home in a district where floodwaters reached up to 4 meters after a river burst its banks.\n\nAnother victim drowned while four people were killed after the Tuesday evening downpour triggered landslides in the city\u2019s outskirts.\n\n\u201cWe have shut down power (in many areas) to avoid more electrical shocks,\u201d Ikhsan Asaad, an official of state firm PLN, said.\n\nAsaad said he could not estimate how many residents had been affected by the power shutdown. \u201cWe\u2019re currently focusing on taking measures to ensure people\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\nAuthorities said about 13,000 people were evacuated but that figure did not include residents in Jakarta\u2019s satellite cities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re evacuating people right now,\u201d Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan told reporters. \u201cEveryone living near rivers should anticipate (more) flooding.\u201d\n\nJakarta is regularly hit by floods during Indonesia\u2019s rainy season, which started in late November.\n\nYesterday, service at Halim Perdanakusuma airport, which handles commercial and military planes, was temporarily shut due to severe flooding on its runways, according to the transport ministry.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Source", "Afp", "Utc January"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 08:11:02 2020", "summary":
