Investors responded by sending its stock up 12%, adding more than $10 billion to its market capitalization.\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate's shareholders haven't lost their minds. SoftBank's Vision Fund certainly stomached a $2 billion loss after writing down its investments in WeWork and Uber, slashing the company's operating income from nearly $4 billion to less than $25 million.\n\nHowever, investors cared more about a federal judge ruling in favor of Sprint's $26 billion merger with T-Mobile on Tuesday, clearing the way for the deal to close after nearly two years of regulatory challenges. The wireless carrier's stock skyrocketed 78% on the news. As SoftBank owns nearly 85% of Sprint, it netted more than $12 billion on paper.\n\nSoftBank led with the good news in its earnings presentation on Wednesday. The third slide is an image of a roiling ocean with the caption, \"Tide is turning.\" The fifth slide is a chart showing Sprint's stock price going vertical on Tuesday. On the next slide, it downplayed the $2 billion loss at its Vision Fund by pointing out the segment lost $8.8 billion in the second quarter.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Theron Mohamed"], "publish_date": "Mon Feb 10 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Japanese tech giant suffered from its bets on Uber and WeWork, but investors cared more about a judge approving the Sprint and T-Mobile merger.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/public/assets/MI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png?v=2021-08", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "SoftBank's profits nosedived 99% last quarter.
