And did so without consulting Congress.\u201d\n\nCNN pointed out that Ms Pelosi said she asked the Trump administration why the plans were not shared \u2013 as is usually the case \u2013 and she told \u201cwe held it closely\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd the \u2018president said, well, \u2018I informed you by reading my tweets\u2019. No, that\u2019s not the relationship that our founders had in mind in the constitution of the United States, had when they gave power to the president \u2014 to the White House to do one thing in terms of our national security, and to the Congress to declare war and to allocate resources and the rest,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the aftermath of the killing of 62-year-old Soleimani, top US officials, including secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defence secretary Mike Esper, defended the move, suggesting there was an imminent threat to American interests in plans he was overseeing.\n\nMr Esper said the threat was \u201cdays\u201d away, rather than weeks, when questioned by reporters at the Pentagon this week.\n\n\u201cWe have no illusions about Iran, no illusions about Soleimani,\u201c Ms Pelosi said.\n\n\u201cHe was a terrible person, did bad things. But it\u2019s not about how bad they are. It\u2019s about how good we are \u2014 protecting the people in a way that prevents war, and does not have us producing again and again generations of veterans who are suffering.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Nancy Pelosi", "Qassem Soleimani", "Iran", "Donald Trump", "US politics", "Americas", "World", "News"], "tags": ["Nancy Pelosi |", "Nancy Pelosi", "Iran |", "Qassem Soleimani |", "Donald Trump |", "The Trump administration\u2019s", "Qassem Soleimani"], "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  9 11:40:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Trump administration\u2019s killing of Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani\u00a0did not make the US any safer, Nancy Pelosi has claimed.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/img/shortcut-icons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/iran-trump-pelosi-soleimani-congress-press-conference-today-a9277121.html", "title": "Soleimani killing does not make 'the country safer', Pelosi says", "description": "Congress acting to limit president\u2019s ability to launch military operations without consultation", "updated_time": "2020-01-09T17:26:49+00:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/09/12/pelosi-disdainful-0.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "video": {"identifier": "https://house-fastly-signed-eu-west-1-prod.brightcovecdn.com/media/v1/pmp4/static/clear/624246174001/472ee1b3-7d17-4ad8-9505-ee5fd7541216/b36493d4-6323-4145-9822-2da87b650644/main.mp4?fastly_token=NWZmODlmMmZfZDY0ZDkwZTVlNjVjMDM5ZmE5N2Q3MGE1NDdkZDY1YzVjZTU4NThlNTI0NjQ0NWRjNzExNTllYWU1ZTI1ODc1MV8vL2hvdXNlLWZhc3RseS1zaWduZWQtZXUtd2VzdC0xLXByb2QuYnJpZ2h0Y292ZWNkbi5jb20vbWVkaWEvdjEvcG1wNC9zdGF0aWMvY2xlYXIvNjI0MjQ2MTc0MDAxLzQ3MmVlMWIzLTdkMTctNGFkOC05NTA1LWVlNWZkNzU0MTIxNi9iMzY0OTNkNC02MzIzLTQxNDUtOTgyMi0yZGE4N2I2NTA2NDQvbWFpbi5tcDQ%3D", "type": "application/octet-stream"}}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/9277121"}, "description": "The Trump administration\u2019s killing of Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani\u00a0did not make the US any safer, Nancy Pelosi has claimed.", "keywords": "Nancy Pelosi, Qassem Soleimani, Iran, Donald Trump, US politics, Americas, World, News", "fb": {"pages": 13312631635, "admins": 729735830, "app_id": 235586169789578}, "article": {"tag": "Nancy Pelosi", "published_time": "2020-01-09T11:40:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-09T17:26:49+00:00", "section": "US politics", "subsection": "Video", "author_name": "Andrew Buncombe", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 463, "image_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "embed_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 7, "external_link_count": 0}, "twitter": {"title": "Soleimani killing does not make 'the country safer', Pelosi says", "description": "The Trump administration\u2019s killing of Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani\u00a0did not make the US any safer, Nancy Pelosi has claimed.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@independent"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Independent"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/iran-trump-pelosi-soleimani-congress-press-conference-today-a9277121.html"}
