Mike DeWine at his Thursday coronavirus media briefing said his plea to parents to take their kids out of day care was yielding results.\n\nThe state has already closed down schools and limited gatherings in the state to 10 people as a response to the infectious COVID-19 virus. The governor has indicated that restrictions will be placed on child day care at some point, though he said in past briefings he is giving time for parents to make arrangements.\n\n\u201cPeople have taken our advice and used their own judgment and taken their kids home,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cWe are now in the process of determining how many of the kids left there represent parents who are vital to our health system, vital to our economy and those determinations are being made. But you\u2019re already seeing a dramatic drop in the number of kids in day care and we will have more for you tomorrow.\u201d\n\nLast week, DeWine suggested parents find accommodations in the event he closes child care facilities. During last Sunday\u2019s briefing, he said an order would be coming soon.\n\nThroughout his administration\u2019s response to coronavirus, the governor has generally telegraphed the next possible steps he might take to prevent the spread of the disease, which reached 119 confirmed cases on Thursday.\n\nClose contact between any two individuals is not recommended as they may spread the disease even if they don\u2019t show symptoms.\n\nDoctors have gone so far as to suggest that even small gatherings of children should be avoided, such as playdates.\n\nRead more cleveland.com coverage:\n\nOhio health officials investigating possible first death from coronavirus in Lucas County\n\nCoronavirus information, services limited for Ohioans who don\u2019t speak English\n\nWhen thermometers are not available, what should Ohio employers do to screen workers for the coronavirus?\n\nGov.
