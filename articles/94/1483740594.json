The parade begins at 9 a.m. EST at City Hall and continues south on Broad Street until it hits Washington Avenue. It's expected to conclude at 5 p.m.\n\nThousands of people line the streets to watch the procession, and those who can't be there in person can stream the parade live from the comfort of their home. People in the Philadelphia area can watch the parade on TV by tuning in to WPHL. The outlet also has a live stream set up on its website.\n\nThere are five divisions of mummers in the parade. Comics try to make people laugh with slapstick or sarcastic comedy, while those in the Wench Brigade Division don the traditional attire of a dress, hat or scarf, bloomers and a parasol.\n\nFancies are judged on their ornate costuming, and Fancy Brigades put on Broadway-like performances. String Bands also put on a show with saxophones, banjos and percussion dominating the band, according to the Mummers Museum.\n\nThe first formal Mummers Parade was in 1901. The event is the oldest continuous folk parade in the United States, according to the Mummers Museum. Before the parade became official, in the 17th and 18th centuries, mummers used to fire guns into the air as part of the celebration, but firearms are no longer allowed in the parade because they could be dangerous.\n\nAlthough the mummers engage in fierce competition on New Year's Day, George Balzer IV of the Woodland String Band told WPVI that they're \"family\" the rest of the year. Ahead of the 2020 parade, clubs threw their support behind the South Philly String Band, which lost two members in a car crash on January 2. Dennis Palandro, Joe Ferry and his fianc\u00e9e, Kelly Wiseley, were killed after a driver veered into opposing traffic, hitting their car.\n\nOn Sunday, the Golden Crown Fancy Brigade presented the South Philly String Band with a bear and their walk-through T-shirt. The shirt included the South Philly String Band's emblem, featuring Palandro's, Ferry's and Wiseley's initials, and was intended to honor the club during the walk-through.\n\n\"Whether you're in the Comics, the string band or the Fancies, we're all mummers and we're all in together and we're all brothers and sisters, and that's what this parade has always been about\u2014traditions,\" Golden Crown's Bill Burke Jr. told WPVI.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Parade", "Philadelphia"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:15:01 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Mummers Parade is believed to be the oldest continuous folk parade in the U.S., according to the Mummers Museum.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://g.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/favicon-96x96.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "U.S.,philadelphia,parade", "description": "The Mummers Parade is believed to be the oldest continuous folk parade in the U.S., according to the Mummers Museum.", "fb": {"app_id": 245537789135954, "pages": 18343191100}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Newsweek", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/mummers-parade-2020-philadelphia-how-watch-live-stream-1479902", "title": "How to watch, live stream the 2020 Mummers Parade in Philadelphia", "description": "The Mummers Parade is believed to be the oldest continuous folk parade in the U.S., according to the Mummers Museum.", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1556931/mummers-parade-philadelphia-watch-live.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek", "published_time": "2020-01-01T00:15:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T00:15:01-05:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@newsweek", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How to watch, live stream the 2020 Mummers Parade in Philadelphia", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/mummers-parade-2020-philadelphia-how-watch-live-stream-1479902", "description": "The Mummers Parade is believed to be the oldest continuous folk parade in the U.S., according to the Mummers Museum.", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1556931/mummers-parade-philadelphia-watch-live.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://g.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://g.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/browserconfig.xml"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.newsweek.com/mummers-parade-2020-philadelphia-how-watch-live-stream-1479902"}
