This is combined with the steady increase of opossums, raccoons, squirrels and other animals The Ark cared for in 2019.\n\n\"This continued growth has led us to greatly expand our animal housing areas to accommodate the increase, and of course, ever increasing costs to feed the animals,\" Howard said. \"We expect this trend to continue in the coming years and we want to be ready for the animals that need our care.\"\n\nHe attributed it to the unprecedented housing growth in Northeast Florida that reduces land availability for wildlife. Animals are forced from their natural habitats and are increasingly encountering people and traffic.\n\n\"They are losing their habitats and are closer to our roads and land where people can see/find injured animals,\" said Sherry Ledbetter, also with the Hilliard sanctuary. \"In addition, more and more people know about The Ark and the job we do, so we are recommended when injured or abandoned animals are found.\"\n\nOrphaned wildlife are kept and cared for until they can be released back into the wild. Others that are injured or handicapped and not capable of surviving in the wild are cared for at the sanctuary their entire lives. Howard said those numbers are increasing as well.\n\nOne such fawn taken in over the fall is Nymera, born with no eyes. Howard said she is now growing and thriving at The Ark.\n\n\"People ask, \u2018Why would we try to save an animal like this?\u2019 Why wouldn\u2019t we, they may have a handicap or be different, but they still cherish life like any other,\" he said on the sanctuary\u2019s Facebook. \"... Nymera thanks us with nuzzles and licks and kisses, believe me they value life.\"\n\nHoward previously told The Times-Union that a battle with kidney cancer and a fawn arriving in his front yard changed his outlook and led him to this passion for wildlife rehabilitation. He went through the training and education and received a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission permit for The Ark in 2014.\n\nIt is not a nuisance-control or animal-trapping service but help when injured or orphaned animals are found and also have veterinarians available if necessary.\n\nScott Butler: (904) 359-4566", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Scott Butler"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.jacksonville.com/Global/images/favicons/jacksonville_favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "The Florida Times-Union", "title": "Jacksonville-area wildlife rescues are on the rise; Hilliard's The Ark sees record growth", "description": "Northeast Florida\u2019s booming housing industry isn\u2019t leaving a lot of options for the area\u2019s wildlife, as noted by surge in animals taken", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.jacksonville.com/storyimage/LK/20200101/NEWS/200109948/AR/0/AR-200109948.jpg", "width": 1007, "height": 675}, "type": "article"}, "msvalidate.01": "7E15F9269E2CE66F2A488ABB04B5015E", "fb": {"pages": 6244094789}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1339992191?at=1000lkC&ct=sb-jacksonville", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.ghm.floridatimesunion", "bt": {"pubDate": "20200101T09:01:24Z", "modDate": "20200101T09:01:00Z", "author": "Scott Butler"}, "twitter": {"title": "Jacksonville-area wildlife rescues are on the rise; Hilliard's The Ark sees record growth", "description": "Northeast Florida\u2019s booming housing industry isn\u2019t leaving a lot of options for the area\u2019s wildlife, as noted by surge in animals taken in by a Nassau County wildlife rescue nonprofit.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.jacksonville.com/storyimage/LK/20200101/NEWS/200109948/AR/0/AR-200109948.jpg&MaxW=1200&MaxH=630", "site": "@jaxdotcom"}, "author": "Scott Butler", "vf": {"unique_id": "siteLK-pub5037-AAD704BC-F119-4548-9ACE-55B75339DA92"}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.jacksonville.com/news/20200101/jacksonville-area-wildlife-rescues-are-on-rise-hilliardrsquos-ark-sees-record-growth"}
