He said he had already done away with the high-level corruption that was rampant in previous governments, but said it was crucial to draw a bright line between criminal elements and authorities so that the two sides do not mingle as they had in the past.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when Guzm\u00e1n had the same power or had the influence that the then president had ... because there had been a conspiracy and that made it difficult to punish those who committed crimes. That has already become history, gone to the garbage dump of history,\" L\u00f3pez Obrador said.\n\nIt appeared to be a reference to the indictment and arrest last month of Mexico's former public safety secretary Genaro Garc\u00eda Luna. Garc\u00eda Luna was public safety secretary in President Felipe Calderon's Cabinet from 2006 to 2012. Before joining Calderon\u2019s government, Garc\u00eda Luna led Mexico\u2019s equivalent of the FBI, the Federal Investigative Agency, under President Vicente Fox.\n\nHe was charged in federal court in New York with three counts of trafficking cocaine and one count of making false statements. He had been living in Florida and was arrested in Texas.\n\nU.S. prosecutors allege he accepted millions of dollars in bribes from Guzm\u00e1n's Sinaloa cartel and in exchange allowed it to operate without interference.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n was convicted on drug conspiracy charges in New York. He was sentenced last year to life in prison.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador's public safety secretary Alfonso Durazo on Wednesday echoed the president's comments about rooting out corruption in the security forces.\n\nIn a series of posts on Twitter, Durazo also said the government would recruit 21,170 people in 2020 to join the newly formed National Guard and continue to expand its presence in the country. L\u00f3pez Obrador has bet big that the new federal security force will be able to wrangle violence that generated a record-setting number of murders in 2019.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Associated Press", "Collections: World", "Collections: Top News", "World News"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Mexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador closed out 2019 with a parting shot at his predecessors, saying imprisoned drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n Loera had had the same power as the country's president.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/static/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Mexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador closed out 2019 with a parting shot at his predecessors, saying imprisoned drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n Loera had had the same power as the country's president.", "keywords": "Associated Press,Collections: World,Collections: Top News,World News", "site": "news", "zone": "world/articles", "fb": {"pages": 5834919267, "app_id": 130063997038366}, "og": {"title": "Mexico President Says 'El Chapo' Had Same Power as President", "description": "Mexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador says that imprisoned drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n had had the same power as the country's president.", "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/a1815c4/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F42%2Fa6ab68edadf7ebb35ca9a758c9ef2c%2Fmedia%3A05f955dda244415c8d5839456728529bMexico_Corruption_81590.jpg", "type": "article", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "url": "https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-01-01/mexico-president-says-el-chapo-had-same-power-as-president"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/a1815c4/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F42%2Fa6ab68edadf7ebb35ca9a758c9ef2c%2Fmedia%3A05f955dda244415c8d5839456728529bMexico_Corruption_81590.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@USNews", "title": "Mexico President Says 'El Chapo' Had Same Power as President", "description": "Mexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador says that imprisoned drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n had had the same power as the country's president."}, "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "optimizely": "Optimizely is supported by this application but is not enabled for this page."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-01-01/mexico-president-says-el-chapo-had-same-power-as-president"}
