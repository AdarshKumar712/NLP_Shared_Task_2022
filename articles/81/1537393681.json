A counter-protest is also expected to take place.\n\nEarlier this week, the party nominated Bjorn Hocke to run for the post of state premier.\n\nIn early February, a candidate from the Free Democratic Party (FDP), Thomas Kemmerich, was elected as the Thuringian Minister-President with support from local Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and AfD politicians. This caused turmoil within the CDU since that support violated the principles of the party's leadership not to cooperate with the AfD in any way. Following the scandal, Kemmerich resigned just three days after he was elected.\n\n*Follow Sputnik's live feed to find out more.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Germany", "AfD", "AfD rally", "Thuringia state premier election"], "tags": ["Germany", "Alternative for Germany (AfD)", "Christian Democratic Union (CDU)", "rally"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "On Monday, the AfD announced that founding member and speaker Bjorn Hocke had been chosen as the party's nominee for state premier.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn3.img.sputniknews.com/i/sputnik.png", "meta_data": {"description": "On Monday, the AfD announced that founding member and speaker Bjorn Hocke had been chosen as the party's nominee for state premier.", "keywords": "Germany, AfD, AfD rally,Thuringia state premier election", "news_keywords": "Germany, AfD, AfD rally,Thuringia state premier election", "robots": "all", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "ahrefs-site-verification": "ahrefs-site-verification_899ad24abeb428773ae480d902877f72151b81b12d4b7293cbfa1c452c76adcd", "analytics": {"site_domain": "sputniknews.com", "article_id": 1078462532, "p_ts": 1583255088, "rubric": "europe", "tags": "Germany, AfD, AfD rally,Thuringia state premier election"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SputnikInt", "url": "https://sputniknews.com/europe/202003031078462532-afd-supporters-hold-rally-in-erfurt-ahead-of-state-premier-election---video-/", "title": "AfD Supporters Hold Rally in Erfurt Ahead of State Premier Election - Video", "description": "On Monday, the AfD announced that founding member and speaker Bjorn Hocke had been chosen as the party's nominee for state premier.", "image": "https://sputniknews.com/sharing_snippet/1078462532.png?1583255088"}, "fb": {"app_id": 799135720145118, "pages": 357990416180}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=969452947, app-argument=com.sputniknews://article?issuer_id=17&issuer_article_id=1078462532", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.sputniknews.sputnik", "og": {"title": "AfD Supporters Hold Rally in Erfurt Ahead of State Premier Election - Video", "url": "https://sputniknews.com/europe/202003031078462532-afd-supporters-hold-rally-in-erfurt-ahead-of-state-premier-election---video-/", "type": "website", "description": "On Monday, the AfD announced that founding member and speaker Bjorn Hocke had been chosen as the party's nominee for state premier.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn5.img.sputniknews.com/images/107846/18/1078461861.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 440}}, "lastmod": "2020-03-03T17:04:48Z", "pubdate": "2020-03-03T17:04:48Z", "url_type": "usual"}, "canonical_link": "https://sputniknews.com/europe/202003031078462532-afd-supporters-hold-rally-in-erfurt-ahead-of-state-premier-election---video-/"}
