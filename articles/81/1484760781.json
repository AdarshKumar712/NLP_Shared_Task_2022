Lows tonight will otherwise range from the upper 30s to low 40s for most areas. Light rain will pass through on Friday with the steadiest staying south of the Thruway. Clouds will dominate with highs in the 40s.\n\nThe next slug of moisture will head in Saturday morning with what looks to be a mix of snow north of the Thruway with more in the way of light rain to the south initially. Colder air will moving in will gradually change this mix over to all snow before tapering Saturday evening. Some slippery pavement will be likely Saturday night and into Sunday morning.\n\nMore of a seasonable chill is then expected for Sunday and much of next week. While Sunday looks fairly uneventful, the pattern will stay active with occasional widespread light snow Monday through Wednesday.\n\nAnother warm up will be possible Friday and into next weekend with some rain looking likely for now.\n\nHave a great evening!", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Todd Kerkman", "Rochester", "News", "Weather Stories"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Published Pm Et Jan."], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Some light rain Friday with wet snow to follow for Saturday.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": null, "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Some light rain Friday with wet snow to follow for Saturday.", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "HTML5,Flash", "PreferredFormats": "MPEG4"}, "robots": "noodp, noydir", "googlebot": "index, follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=740948885", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.twcable.twcnews", "keywords": "Todd Kerkman, Rochester, News, Weather Stories", "news_keywords": "Todd Kerkman, Rochester, News, Weather Stories", "og": {"title": "Warm For The Season For Now, Some Wet Snow This Weekend", "type": "article", "url": "https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/rochester/weather/2020/01/02/rochester-forecast", "description": "Changeable Friday to Saturday with rain to wet snow.", "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/static-cny-wx-rainy-duckspng-9"}, "twitter": {"title": "Warm For The Season For Now, Some Wet Snow This Weekend", "description": "Changeable Friday to Saturday with rain to wet snow.", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/rochester/weather/2020/01/02/rochester-forecast", "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/static-cny-wx-rainy-duckspng-9"}, "story": {"headline": "Warm For The Season For Now, Some Wet Snow This Weekend", "description": "Some light rain Friday with wet snow to follow for Saturday."}}, "canonical_link": "https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/rochester/weather/2020/01/02/rochester-forecast"}
