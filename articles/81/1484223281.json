We are waiting for the order copy for further clarity,\u201d Mr. Desai said.\n\nMallya, who is accused of money laundering by the Enforcement Directorate, fled India in March 2016 and is now based in London.\n\nThe lenders in their application said they want to liquidate assets to claim over \u20b96,000 crore.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Vijay Mallya", "Mallya\u2019s movable assets", "Vijay Mallya assets", "UBHL", "United Breweries Holdings Ltd"], "tags": ["economic offence/ tax evasion", "corruption & bribery", "railway", "economy, business and finance", "Uttar Pradesh", "corporate crime", "Fact Check", "armed Forces", "Tamil cinema", "The Hindu Explains", "population and census", "Citizenship Amendment Act"], "authors": ["Party Releases A Booklet On Modi S Claims Over Caa", "At The Core Of The Nearly Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid Dispute Is The Belief That Lord Ram Was Born Years Ago In The Treta Yuga", "In A Room Located Under What Was The Central Dome Of The Babri Masjid"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The consortium of banks earlier filed an application, seeking release of Mallya\u2019s movable assets.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thehindu.com/thfavicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Banks allowed to utilise Mallya\u2019s movable assets to clear debt", "atdlayout": "articlepage", "description": "The consortium of banks earlier filed an application, seeking release of Mallya\u2019s movable assets.", "keywords": "Vijay Mallya,Mallya\u2019s movable assets,Vijay Mallya assets,UBHL,United Breweries Holdings Ltd", "news_keywords": "Vijay Mallya,Mallya\u2019s movable assets,Vijay Mallya assets,UBHL,United Breweries Holdings Ltd", "publish-date": "2020-01-01T14:38:59+05:30", "created-date": "2020-01-01T14:38:59+05:30", "modified-date": "2020-01-01T14:40:32+05:30", "twitter": {"creator": "PTI", "title": "Banks allowed to utilise Mallya\u2019s movable assets to clear debt", "description": "The consortium of banks earlier filed an application, seeking release of Mallya\u2019s movable assets.", "image": "https://www.thehindu.com/business/article20665132.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23BUMALLYA", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@The_Hindu", "domain": "thehindu.com", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "The Hindu", "googleplay": "The Hindu (Official App)", "iphone": "The Hindu for iPhone"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.mobstac.thehindu", "iphone": 771672321}}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=584786636", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mobstac.thehindu", "fb": {"app_id": 137450626398044, "pages": 163974433696568}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hindu", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/banks-allowed-to-utilise-mallyas-movable-assets-to-clear-debt/article30450404.ece", "type": "article", "title": "Banks allowed to utilise Mallya\u2019s movable assets to clear debt", "description": "The consortium of banks earlier filed an application, seeking release of Mallya\u2019s movable assets.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thehindu.com/business/article20665132.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23BUMALLYA", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "PTI", "tag": "United Breweries Holdings Ltd", "section": "National"}, "msvalidate.01": "00762243DAFA333A5A6D97CE4545BDB2", "yandex-verification": "ff4648e5089d361d", "ahrefs-site-verification": "6df5b97abf2ea60f2d4123265496b92b4faa009ceff5444e0b8482ebddd508d6", "theme-color": "#fff"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/banks-allowed-to-utilise-mallyas-movable-assets-to-clear-debt/article30450404.ece"}
