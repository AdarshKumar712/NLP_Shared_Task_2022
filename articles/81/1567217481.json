Mike DeWine said Friday that he would consider a mass shutdown of businesses in the state if employers do not take the proper precautions to protect employees from coronavirus.\n\nIt\u2019s a drastic move that has been applied in other states \u2013 one that DeWine said he was trying his hardest to avoid as he balances keeping the economy going with ensuring the safety and health of Ohioans. However, DeWine said his office continues to receive texts and emails about businesses \u200bthat are not taking the proper precautions, which could force his hand to shut down businesses statewide.\n\n\u201cThis simply must stop. I implore you, please, do what is right,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cAs I continue to balance my responsibility to the people of the state of Ohio, the responsibility, when I took an oath of office to do the essential thing government does, which is to protect the people. As I balance that with our attempt to keep this economy moving, let me make it very, very clear, that I will err on the side of protecting people.\u201d\n\nThe aggressive announcement came the same day Ohio confirmed its first death from coronavirus \u2013 a Toledo attorney whom DeWine said he and Lt. Gov. Jon Husted considered a friend \u2013 as the number of cases climbed to 169.\n\nSo far, DeWine and health officials have decided against mass business closures across the state, with the exception of restaurants and bars, \u200bsalons, barbershops and some others. At no time had they ruled out the option, though.\n\n\u201cNo announcement today,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cBut the bad behavior, the reckless behavior, must stop. And I congratulate all those who are out there making a difference every day, businesses who are mindful of what they need to do to protect their employees. Evidence shows when businesses do this and are very, very aggressive, they can protect their employees. I would ask, please, do that.\u201d\n\nDeWine said call centers were among the list of businesses he\u2019s received complaints about, though they included a \u201cwide range of different types of businesses.\u201d\n\nDeWine made several recommendations \u2013 now, more appropriately viewed as orders \u2013 for businesses to take extra care and pay attention to best practices: physical distancing, sanitary conditions and monitoring employees\u2019 health.\n\nEarlier this week, he asked businesses to take workers\u2019 temperatures. Fever is one symptom of the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cI think people can imagine what that next step would be,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cI\u2019ve not hesitated in the past to close businesses and other operations if they are a threat to the public. The safety of the public has to come first. There\u2019s a way we can do this, but we have to do it. I think I\u2019ve demonstrated that I\u2019m going to put the safety of the people first.\u201d\n\nRead more cleveland.com politics coverage:\n\nPresident Trump suspends student loan interest, allows payment delays during coronavirus pandemic\n\nAlthough mail-in voting continues, Ohio\u2019s postponed primary remains clouded by legal, political disputes\n\nPresident Trump, Ohio Gov.
