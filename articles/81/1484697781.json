The couple held the only division one winning entry nationally in the Monday and Wednesday X Lotto draw which was drawn on December 23. An SA Lotteries official called the couple to inform them of their win, the woman answered the phone but interrupted the official to make sure her husband would get to hear the news at the same time. The woman said she only played sporadically and had marked her numbers at random. \"They weren't special beforehand, but they definitely are now,\" she said. When asked how they planned to spend their life-changing windfall, the thrilled couple confessed they were looking forward to house-hunting in the new year. \"We'll definitely be buying a house but after that we don't know,\" she said. \"I don't think the news has really sunk in yet,\" the husband added. The couple who wish to remain anonymous, purchased their six-game marked entry online.\n\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/32ui8UE6ZJbtvC4phXfSTtM/df83febe-a06b-4d0a-ac25-a864e1751dad.jpg/r0_338_6653_4097_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 10:11:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A YOUNG Eyre Peninsula couple celebrated Christmas as millionaires after winning the $1 million division one prize in X Lotto.
