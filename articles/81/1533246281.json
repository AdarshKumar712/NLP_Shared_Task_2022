Netanyahu, who at 70 is a decade older than Gantz, denies any wrongdoing, calling the investigation a witch-hunt.\n\n\u201cThe man charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust has nothing to sell other than disseminated lies and slung mud,\u201d Gantz tweeted about Netanyahu a week before the election. \u201cIsrael needs a full-time prime minister.\u201d\n\nBut while Blue and White has talked up Gantz\u2019s military background, Likud has sought to portray their opponent as soft on Iran and too conciliatory toward the Palestinians.\n\nGayil Talshir, a Hebrew University political scientist, said Israel still appeared to be split, reflecting the inconclusive outcome of elections in April and September last year in which neither party could form a ruling coalition.\n\nBlue and White led Likud in opinion polls for weeks during this campaign but recent surveys have shown Likud pulling slightly ahead.\n\n\u201cThe trial is super-important... the center and left in Israel is going against Netanyahu,\u201d Talshir said. \u201cBut his (Netanyahu\u2019s) own base is rallying around Netanyahu.\u201d\n\n\u2019PROPER CONDUCT\u2019\n\nTall and athletic, with a fondness for folk singing and motorcycle riding, Gantz was a consensus figure for Israelis when chief of the conscript military between 2011 and 2015.\n\nBut what he would do in power is not entirely clear, as he has sent mixed messages.\n\nHe casts himself as more diplomatically accommodating than Netanyahu, urging redoubled efforts to restart peace talks.\n\nBut while Palestinians may prefer Gantz to Netanyahu, there is little fondness for him after two wars in the Gaza Strip, a self-governing Palestinian enclave, while Gantz was in charge of the Israeli military. About 2,300 Palestinians were killed in the fighting.\n\nHe has also publicly embraced US President Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East plan, which was rejected outright by the Palestinians for what they see as pro-Israel bias.\n\nWhile Netanyahu holds rallies around the country exhorting his right-wing supporters to turn out, Gantz\u2019s party believes some may be persuaded to peel away by a cross-partisan appeal to \u201cproper conduct.\u201d \u201cOur polls indicate that a considerable number of Likud supporters are unhappy with the situation and are wavering,\u201d Yoaz Hendel, one of the party\u2019s lawmakers, told Reuters. \u201cThey are part of our focus.\u201d\n\nGantz\u2019s \u201cMr Clean\u201d image took a knock last week when police announced an investigation into the conduct of a now-defunct security consultancy that he chaired after he left the military.\n\nGantz is not a suspect in the case, but Netanyahu seized on it to try to undermine his less experienced opponent.\n\nGantz has also made occasional stumbles in campaign interviews, getting an interviewer\u2019s name wrong and stammering slightly while collecting his thoughts.\n\nNetanyahu has used these stumbles as ammunition to accuse Gantz as lacking the capacity for quick thinking.\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t speak like you. Big deal,\u201d Gantz responded brusquely during a televised speech on Wednesday. \u201cWhile you were taking acting classes in New York, I was defending this country.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Jubail", "Al-Ahsa", "Al-Kharj", "Taif", "Qatif", "oil", "Dammam", "Abha", "Asir", "Yanbu", "islam", "jobs", "sports", "Khalij times", "gulf news", "saudi gazette", "Riyadh", "Tabuk", "Mecca", "Medina", "AlMadinah", "Jeddah", "Makkah", "Hail", "Mecca", "Makkah", "Eastern", "King Abdullah", "jobs in Saudi", "work in saudi arabia", "umrah", "Hajj\u060c\u0639\u0631\u0628 \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0632"], "tags": ["The Face", "The Place", "Who's Who"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Feb 27 18:33:53 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "ALGIERS: The son of Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has been acquitted in a high-profile corruption case in which a prominent businessman was sentenced to prison, the national radio reported Thursday.
