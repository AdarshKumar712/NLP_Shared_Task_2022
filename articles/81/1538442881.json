Finance Minister Gernot Bl\u00fcmel spoke about on Austrian television last weekend.\n\nCurrent regulation\n\nFor now, the majority of Austrian gambling regulation is overseen by the Ministry of Finance (BMF). This includes casino and slots, both on and offline.\n\nBut when it comes to sports betting, things are a bit more complicated. Each jurisdiction has its own laws. In Vienna, for example, wagering on this is only permitted between 6 a.m. and midnight. Moreover, there are more minute restrictions when it comes to what can be bet on.\n\nIn Lower Austria, which surrounds Vienna, there no restrictions on sports betting. This is the same for Burgenland, which is in the east of the country.\n\nIssues to address\n\nBl\u00fcmel\u2019s desires to form a independent regulatory body were announced as he was talking about Casinos Austria. This is the country\u2019s gambling monopoly, which in recent months has been hit by scandal recently.\n\nIt was claimed that the appointment of Chief Financial Officer, Peter Sildo, was related to the awarding of licences in Vienna. Sildo is a Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6) District Councillor in the Austrian capital. Moreover, he has shares in Novomatic \u2013 which holds a 17.19% stake in Casinos Austria and had hoped to secure a Viennese licence.\n\nBoth he and Novomatic, however, have since argued that no wrong was done.\n\nFollowing these allegations, the Austrian Association for Betting and Gambling (\u00d6VWG) expressed its wishes for the monopoly to end. It said that an urgent \u201crethink\u201d of the existing monopoly framework was needed.\n\nWhen talking about Casinos Austria, Bl\u00fcmel had the following to say.\n\n\u201cCasinos Austria is a traditional company that provides over 3,000 jobs. It is important to me that [things settle down] and that jobs, its location and tax revenue remain secure.\n\n\u201c\u00d6BAG [referring to \u00d6sterreichische Beteiligungs, the Austrian state\u2019s public investment body] will therefore examine how best to ensure such an \u2018Austria package\u2019.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Ministry of Finance", "Gernot Bl\u00fcmel", "Austria", "gambling", "Austrian Gambling Regulation"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Mar  4 11:29:15 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Austria could soon have a new independent gambling regulator, after the country's new Finance Minister called for reponsibilities to be moved on.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://affiliateinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aff_favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Austria could soon have a new independent gambling regulator, after the country's new Finance Minister called for reponsibilities to be moved on.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Austria: new finance minister wants an independent gambling regulator - AffiliateINSIDER", "description": "Austria could soon have a new independent gambling regulator, after the country's new Finance Minister called for reponsibilities to be moved on.", "url": "https://affiliateinsider.com/austria-new-finance-minister-wants-an-independent-gambling-regulator/", "site_name": "AffiliateINSIDER", "image": {"identifier": "https://affiliateinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elias-maurer-5IuyMgsGlW0-unsplash.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 798, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-04T11:29:15+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Affiliate Insider", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WooCommerce 6.1.1", "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "https://affiliateinsider.com", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://affiliateinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aff_favicon.png", "webgains-site-verification": "z6ao8gve"}, "canonical_link": "https://affiliateinsider.com/austria-new-finance-minister-wants-an-independent-gambling-regulator/"}
