The FA hope that the 13th edition of the tournament will kick-off with a record attendance which will set a benchmark for the rest of the tournament played across eight other venues in England, culminating with the final at the 90,000-capacity Wembley Stadium on Sunday August 1.\n\nThe 110-year-old home of Manchester United, Old Trafford last staged a women's football match in 2012, when the United States defeated Canada 4-3 in a dramatic Olympic semi-final in front of 26,630 fans.\n\nFormer Manchester United player Phil Neville will lead his country out at the stadium where he played for 11 seasons. \"It doesn't get much bigger than managing your country at a home Euro and to have the opportunity to do so at a stadium that holds so many memories for me is huge. Old Trafford has a special place in my heart, but it is also one of the country's most iconic football grounds, so today's announcement is a significant one for the tournament.\u201d\n\nNatalie Burrell, founder of Manchester United Women's supporters group, Barmy Army, is confident that the demand for women's football from fans living in the city will fill the stadium. \"Every time I go to Old Trafford, people are saying to me: 'I see what you're doing with the girls, when is it coming here?' People are waiting for it.\u201d\n\nAs well as Manchester and Wembley, matches will also be played at Brentford, Brighton, Milton Keynes, Rotherham, Sheffield, Southampton and Wigan and Leigh.\n\nThe FA's Director of Women's Football Baroness Sue Campbell declared: \"We\u2019d like to welcome fans from all over Europe, we hope they will come. We\u2019d like to work with our European colleagues to help develop the women\u2019s game across Europe.\u201d\n\nHoping to build on the huge television viewing figures generated during last summer's Women's World Cup and this season's burgeoning WSL attendances, she added that \"we want to excite everyone in this country to come out and watch the women's game, even if they\u2019ve never watched before.\n\n\u201cEuro 2021 is an opportunity. We want to raise the bar yet again for the women's game in England. More fans watching, more women playing, more women coaching, more women refereeing, and an outstanding Women's Super League, to make it the best league in Europe.\u201d\n\nThe record attendance for a Women's Euro match was set in Solna, Sweden when 41,301 people watched Germany defeat Norway in the 2013 Final.\n\nNow Uefa's Head of Women's Football, Nadine Kessler was a member of that German side and describes it as the highlight of her career. \"I think it makes all the difference to give players and teams the stage they deserve. I think it is a completely different experience, a different pressure you have to handle but also a different excitement and motivation.\u201d\n\nIn December 2018, Kessler helped negotiate the deal which saw Visa become Uefa's first exclusive sponsor of women's football. They have since been joined by Nike, who will supply the official match ball for the tournament and Espirit, who will design the uniforms for tournament staff and volunteers.\n\nKessler believes more big-name sponsors will follow. \u201cIt was a very important step we took. There are more sponsors on board. Every cent Uefa will gain from partners will go back into the game. It\u2019s very important to show that women\u2019s football has its own value and partners, and that the media and everybody is interested in the women's game on its own. It will most certainly be our strategy to further enhance this.\u201d\n\nThe tournament's Head of Delivery Chris Bryant previously worked in the same capacity on the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games as well as the 2015 Rugby World Cup and was realistic about the goals the tournament should be looking to achieve. \"We should be doing everything we can to seize on the opportunity that we've got in hosting what is an elite football tournament. It's a phenomenal time for women's football in general.\n\n\u201cThe UK has a fantastic tradition of delivering major events. We've got a very high-skilled team working on the men's Euro who will role straight over to deliver the women's Euros.\u201d\n\nThe eight cities chosen in December to host the tournament do not include any in the south-west or north-east of the country.\n\n\u201cWhilst we are not everywhere, we are relatively comfortable that we are in a good enough spread of venues across the country,\u201d said Bryant. \"We will of course engage with the wider country through our marketing campaign. We know people will travel for big events, we know people will travel to go and watch England. That\u2019s very much part of our plan as well.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, each of the seven host cities in the Netherlands set up city-centre fan zones where 72,916 fans congregated to watch matches on big screens. Bryant is open to the idea but remains unsure if the demand is there.\n\n\u201cOur first priority is to try and sell as many tickets and get people in the stadium if possible. For Euro 2020 in London we\u2019re setting up additional screenings because there\u2019s only 90,000 seats and the ticket demand for England games in the men\u2019s Euro is phenomenal.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not quite the same for the women\u2019s Euros. If there is demand in host cities, we\u2019d love to talk to them about fan zones. We need to be quite realistic about the budgets that the cities have and where our priorities are.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely we are talking to host cities about, be it a fan march, a meeting point, a fan zone, a screening, they\u2019re all on the table but we need to be quite realistic about what will be delivered and where our focus should be and that\u2019s driving attendance to stadia to give the teams that full stadium experience.\u201d\n\nA common inducement during previous tournaments, free city-centre transport for supporters will not be offered to ticket-holders as Bryant explained. \u201cHosting the event already puts a significant strain on host cities in order to provide security and transport infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWhat we will do is focus on those cities where potentially you might need a transport solution that doesn\u2019t already exist. We will work the local councils to potentially put on shuttle buses to try and move fans from the city centre to the venue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to do what the men\u2019s Euros did and offer free public transport with every ticket. It\u2019s incredible costly and it\u2019s incredibly difficult to deliver and we believe our priorities and focus are best elsewhere.\u201d\n\nBurrell, who travels from Didsbury to another of the Euro 2021 venues, the Leigh Sports Village, to watch Manchester United hopes that one tournament legacy will be to improve infrastructure around the LSV Stadium.\n\n\"You'll see better transport links then, which hopefully then we can take advantage of. It's got great facilities. I'd encourage people to go to Leigh.\u201d\n\nOver 700,000 tickets will be made available for the tournament compared to the record 240,045 tickets sold at Euro 2017.\n\n\u201cThat's a huge jump in the available number of tickets that we want to sell,\u201d admits Bryant. \u201cAcross the board, we want to try and sell as many tickets as possible. We\u2019ll look at doing that through accessible tickets, but also through working with local communities to ensure that schools and universities have the opportunities to come to the games as well.\u201d\n\nHow the FA will generate interest in games not involving England remains to be seen as Bryant explains. \u201cWe know that some games are going to be more attractive than others, therefore how do we manage that balance across the country to try and give all of the teams the same experience of having full stadiums?\n\n\u201cThat certainly has been a challenge. We bid before the World Cup in France and that certainly changed how people viewed the tournament, and maybe how we viewed the tournament with some of our venue selections.\n\n\u201cReally it was that led to our inclusion of Old Trafford as the opening venue. We sensed there was an opportunity here maybe to try and open the tournament with a special bang. I think it's really exciting.\n\n\u201cThis is elite sport. This is a big major event, a once in a lifetime opportunity to attend a football tournament in your own country. It\u2019s a rare occasion and therefore people should embrace that, people should embrace those games in their host cities and everyone should try and be a part of it.\n\n\u201cA big part of our marketing campaign is to not just look at football fans but \u2018big eventers,\u2019 people that want to be part of something special which we believe this tournament can be.\n\n\u201cWe want it to be remembered as a tournament, a major event, that gripped the country, that everyone felt part of, that everyone was reminiscing about, a fantastic summer in which everyone had a great time going to the tournament.\u201d\n\nTo register for tickets, competitions and volunteering opportunities visit TheFA.com/WEuro2021", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Women's Football", "Women's Euro 2021", "England"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sun Feb 23 00:01:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "Women's Football, Women's Euro 2021, England", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Star", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Euro 2021 is an opportunity to raise the bar in women\u2019s football again\u2019", "url": "https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/s/euro-2021-opportunity-raise-bar-womens-football-again", "updated_time": "2020-02-23T00:02:00+00:00", "image": "https://morningstaronline.co.uk/sites/all/themes/custom/morningstar_online/morning-star-default.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "url": "https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/s/euro-2021-opportunity-raise-bar-womens-football-again", "title": "\u2018Euro 2021 is an opportunity to raise the bar in women\u2019s football", "image": "https://morningstaronline.co.uk/sites/default/files/WEURO%202021%20-%203_0.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-23T00:01:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-23T00:02:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "canonical_link": "https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/s/euro-2021-opportunity-raise-bar-womens-football-again"}
