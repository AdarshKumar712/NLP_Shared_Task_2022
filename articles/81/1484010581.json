A report was made to me that there was an incident that the area where the things were being stored was broken into. I think the security measures have been upped so as to eliminate that. The things that were stolen have been recovered,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo the sooner Mrs Ram takes possession of her belongings, the better for all of us. They are her things. We have moved them out, they are still her things. So she needs to come and take possession of them. Plain and simple,\u201d added Marshall.\n\nGovernment has compulsory acquired the Bay Street property, owned by prominent businesswoman Asha Mrs Ram Mirchandani, to facilitate construction of a Hyatt Hotel on that stretch of beachfront land.\n\nDuring the week of November 18, the Ministry of Housing, with the assistance of the Royal Barbados Police Force, took possession of the Liquidation Centre building and subsequently began the process of removing and storing millions of dollars in stock.\n\nThis came shortly after Mirchandani held a \u2018kick-me-out sale\u2019 in an effort to get rid of some of the merchandise.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Barbados Today"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Attorney General Dale Marshall is encouraging former owners of the Liquidation Centre building on Bay Street, The City to take possession of the items being stored if they were concerned about theft.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cropped-logo-150x150.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1386333611", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.luovalabs.barbadostodaymobile", "google-site-verification": "tv6HaZJva6u6f8lwfpLqmQ5hBqYUg7fqvhonjYsxXzo", "description": "Attorney General Dale Marshall is encouraging former owners of the Liquidation Centre building on Bay Street, The City to take possession of the items being stored if they were concerned about theft.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mirchandanis can collect stock - Barbados Today", "description": "Attorney General Dale Marshall is encouraging former owners of the Liquidation Centre building on Bay Street, The City to take possession of the items being stored if they were concerned about theft.", "url": "https://barbadostoday.bb/2019/12/31/mirchandanis-can-collect-stock/", "site_name": "Barbados Today", "image": {"identifier": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG-20191117-WA0005.jpg", "secure_url": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG-20191117-WA0005.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 804}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BarbadosToday/", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2020-01-01T03:30:37+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Attorney General Dale Marshall is encouraging former owners of the Liquidation Centre building on Bay Street, The City to take possession of the items being stored if they were concerned about theft.", "title": "Mirchandanis can collect stock - Barbados Today", "site": "@barbadostoday", "image": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG-20191117-WA0005.jpg", "creator": "@barbadostoday"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 1.0.1", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cropped-logo-500x500.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://barbadostoday.bb/2019/12/31/mirchandanis-can-collect-stock/"}
