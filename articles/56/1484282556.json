A similar crime was reported at an unidentified fast-food restaurant in Independence Township on Dec. 21. Two masked suspects also robbed a Taco Bell restaurant in Milford on Dec. 24, as well as a Burger King restaurant in Auburn Hills on Dec. 27.

Witnesses also reported a vehicle matching the same description fleeing from the Milford robbery.\n\nSecurity cameras captured images of the suspects, one of whom was carrying a blue backpack during the Milford and Auburn Hills robberies. The suspects are described as black males in their 20s, with hoods pulled up over their heads and their faces covered.\n\nIt's unclear how much cash the suspects took in the Livonia and Independence Township robberies, but they got about $200 from the Milford robbery. The employees in the Auburn Hills robbery refused to give the suspects money and said they were calling police, which sent the suspects running.\n\nAnyone with information should call Livonia police at 734-466-2330, Milford police at 248-684-1815 or Auburn Hills police at 248-370-9460.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["organized crime", "fast food robbery", "robbery suspect", "All Local"], "authors": ["Https", "Wwjnewsradio.Radio.Com Wwj", "Wwj News"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 13:21:19 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Police believe the same suspects are behind the crimes.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://images.radio.com/wwjaam/WWJAM_favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "standout": "https://wwjnewsradio.radio.comarticles/news/suspects-sought-in-fast-food-robberies-around-metro-detroit", "branch": {"deeplink": {"freq_site_category": "newstalksports", "station_name": "WWJ Newsradio 950", "freq_site_market": "detroit", "station_logo": "https://images.radio.com/wwjaam/general/WWJAM_Header_Small_Logo.png", "freq_site_genre": "newstalk", "station_id": 447}}, "ahrefs-site-verification": "43ab8a26c73c715da3a59de5695c65a1526985ea3ff7458012df42d475e5bb30", "msvalidate.01": "7867DA7F7CD737B913060D6C68AAC51E", "description": "Police believe the same suspects are behind the crimes.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "WWJ Newsradio 950", "title": "VIDEO: Fast-Food Bandits Sought In Multiple Robberies Around Metro Detroit", "type": "article", "url": "https://wwjnewsradio.radio.com/articles/news/suspects-sought-in-fast-food-robberies-around-metro-detroit", "description": "Police believe the same suspects are behind the crimes.", "updated_time": "2019-12-31T13:25:26-0500", "image": "https://images.radio.com/wwjaam/styles/hero_tall__1170x515/s3/livonia%20taco%20bell%20robbery%20suspect.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "text": {"title": "VIDEO: Fast-Food Bandits Sought In Multiple Robberies Around Metro Detroit"}, "site": "@WWJ950", "title": "VIDEO: Fast-Food Bandits Sought In Multiple Robberies Around Metro", "description": "Police believe the same suspects are behind the crimes.", "image": "https://images.radio.com/wwjaam/livonia%20taco%20bell%20robbery%20suspect.jpg"}, "article": {"author": {"identifier": "https://facebook.com/wwj950/", "name": "WWJ News"}, "published_time": "2019-12-31T13:21:19-0500"}, "cXenseParse": {"author": "https://wwjnewsradio.radio.com/WWJ%20News", "recs": {"category": "News/Local News/fast food robbery/All Local/robbery suspect/organized crime"}}, "editorial.radio": "no", "station-call-letters": "WWJ-AM", "nmc": {"pid": "articles_news_suspects-sought-in-fast-food-robberies-around-metro-detroit", "market": "detroit", "station": "wwjam", "genre": "newstalk", "cat": "spoken word", "tag": "fast food robbery/All Local/robbery suspect/organized crime", "author": "WWJ News"}}, "canonical_link": "https://wwjnewsradio.radio.com/articles/news/suspects-sought-in-fast-food-robberies-around-metro-detroit"}
