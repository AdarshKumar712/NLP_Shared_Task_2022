Monica Achana has advised Christians to be careful of false prophets in the country and avoid them as they enter into 2020.\n\nRev. Achana gave the advice during a sermon on the 31st December night service at Mangu on the theme: \u201cLive a Life worth of Praise; Be Warned of False Prophets in 2020\u201d.\n\nShe said in 2020 people, who read and understand the Bible will be tempted to use the same Bible to deceive people as prophets just like we have them today.\n\nShe said such people focused their preachings on miracles since they knew most Christians believed in them.\n\nShe said every Christian was given the power to perform miracles and to heal the sick with fate and that no one should fall prey for fake people who claim to be men or women of God in 2020 as they used the Holy Bible for their own selfish motives.\n\nRev. Achana pleaded with Ghanaians to be humble in 2020 and seek God's guidance before taking any decision especially political leaders in an election year.\n\n\u201cThe New Year gives us the opportunity to reflect on the old year and do away with some bad behaviours and then make decisions for the rest of the months\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 the false prophets will continue to exploit us for their personal gains just like they are doing, let us take note and stay away from them since they are using the Holy Bible for their selfish motives\u201d,she said.\n\nThere was euphoria, ecstasy, display of fireworks and shouts of praise in the church when the clock struck 00:00 hours to usher in the New Year, 2020.\n\nGNA", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["{keywords}"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "{description}", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://ghananewsagency.org/favicon.gif", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive", "description": "{description}", "keywords": "{keywords}", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-translate-customization": "ed4e15358d21bc05-cdb86c6b2a6a0bd0-gdff7727f8d39ef2a-13", "fb": {"pages": 547130695310674, "admins": 539319879}, "og": {"type": "article", "author": "Ghana News Agency", "title": "Christians advised against false prophets", "url": "https://ghananewsagency.org/social/christians-advised-against-false-prophets-162071", "image": "https://ghananewsagency.org/assets/images/social-false-prophets.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@FreshNews_Ghana", "description": "news, story, article", "creator": "@GHANANEWSAGENCY"}}, "canonical_link": "https://ghananewsagency.org/social/christians-advised-against-false-prophets-162071"}
