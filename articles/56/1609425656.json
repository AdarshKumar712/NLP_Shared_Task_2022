REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nVIENNA (Reuters) - Pilots at Austrian Airlines (AUA) (LHAG.DE) are prepared to accept an up to 43% cut of their salaries until 2023 to help reduce costs, an offer comparable to that of their colleagues at parent Lufthansa, the AUA works council said.\n\nTogether with flight attendants, AUA\u2019s 3,900 on-board staff are offering a savings contribution of more than 200 million euros ($216 million) in total, it said.\n\nLufthansa is negotiating a 9 billion euro bailout with Germany\u2019s government and the governments in Austria and Belgium, where it also operates carriers.\n\nAirlines are grappling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and expect a protracted travel slump in its wake.\n\nAUA has applied for 767 million euros in state aid.\n\nIn Switzerland, parliament has already backed a 1.275 billion Swiss franc ($1.31 billion) package in loan guarantees for Lufthansa units Swiss and Edelweiss.\n\nAUA employs 7,000 staff in Austria, and all of them currently work reduced hours.\n\nSome 150-200 AUA pilots will leave the carrier by 2022 due to expiring contracts, and negotiations about part-time work and temporary leaves are ongoing, said Rainer Stratberger, a member of the works council.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["US", "HEALTH", "CORONAVIRUS", "LUFTHANSA", "AUSTRIA", "Germany", "Western Europe", "Transportation (TRBC)",
