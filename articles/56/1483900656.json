Of the countries ranked, 101 improved their scores over the previous year.\n\nThe report said 25 countries have mostly closed the gender gap in education at 96.1 per cent. Health care was also close to parity at 95.7 per cent. It will, however, take 99.5 years to achieve gender parity worldwide \u2014 but that number is down from the 108 years projected in the forum\u2019s 2018 index.
