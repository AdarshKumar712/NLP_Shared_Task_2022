by 2022 this number will exceed 55 per cent!\n\nBut what amazes me the most is that today users communicate with voice-activated speakers like as if they were talking to another human being, using courtesy words like \"please,\" and \"thank you,\" and even \"sorry\"!\n\nInterestingly, we search with voice just like we speak.\n\nNo wonder, voice search queries are longer than regular text-based searches.\n\nVoice search queries tend to have three-to-five keywords in length, compared to one or two words in text search.\n\nSo, come 2020, there is going to be a whole new paradigm shift triggered by the enhanced, and consistently growing, usage of voice in things digital.\n\nNow to video, the other major driving force that will dominate 2020, and beyond.\n\nAs per a Cisco report, by 2020 there will be close to 1 million minutes of video crossing the Internet per second.\n\nVideo is expected to make up 82% of Internet traffic by 2021.\n\nBy 2022, online videos will make up more than 84% of all consumer Internet traffic -- 15 times higher than it was in 2017.\n\nIn the past 10 years, mobile video consumption has risen by 100%, year-on-year.\n\nCan statistics tell a bigger story of what the future holds?\n\nToday, more than 8,000 million videos are viewed on Facebook every day.\n\nIn 2020, the big leap forward will be the virtual reality video.\n\nFacebook's new Horizon social VR platform alone will phenomenally expand the experience of travel and event participation.\n\nThis is already evident in the 360-degree videos of National Geographic that are transforming sensory experiences like never before.\n\nIt is in keeping with these apertures and opportunities that research agency Kantar reported that 84% of marketers plan to increase their investment in online video advertising over the next 12 months.\n\nPhotograph: Ashish Narsale/ Rediff.com IMAGE: In the past 10 years, mobile video consumption has risen by 100%, year-on-year.\n\nBut why is video important?\n\nWell, for starters, 97% marketers assert that video helps them increase user understanding of their products and services.\n\n81% of businesses in 2020 are, therefore, most likely to use video as a marketing tool (up from 61% in 2019).\n\nThe reasons are not far to seek.\n\n46% of users act after viewing a video ad.\n\nAnd if they enjoy the video their purchase intent increases by a whopping 97%.\n\nResearch shows that including a video on a Web site's landing page can boost conversion rates by up to 80%.\n\nFor those who require any more convincing: Tracking studies show that a Web site is 53 times more likely to reach the front page of Google if it includes video.\n\nVideo, in fact, increases organic search traffic on a Web site by 157%.\n\nIn 2020, a voice content strategy will no longer be optional for brands.\n\nVoice in the decade ahead will revolve around 'youtility' marketing... how it can prove to be a real and compelling utility for you... not just rooted in information and in being ever-helpful, but in using more complex API-driven interactions that will enhance consumer experience through more layers of specificity and nuance.\n\nThe insight on video, going forward, simply is that users do not always watch a video with the intention of buying something, now or later.\n\nBut watching video leads to discovery.\n\nAnd triggering of intent.\n\nLeading to evaluation.\n\nFinally purchase.\n\nSo, video is a critical part of every stage in the customer journey.\n\nAnd brands have no choice but to participate in that journey.\n\nIn 2020, and after.\n\nSo, the dawn of the new decade is going to be about the 2Vs that will drive another very important V... Voice and Video that will drive consumer Value for brands.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Business news", "business news India", "India business news", "Indian economy news", "Indian financial news"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "How voice & video will dominate in 2020.
