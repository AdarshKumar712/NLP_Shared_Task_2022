Warren Distinguished Professor of Law at the UCLA School of Law and he published his diversity statement on his blog in a post titled \u201cI submit herewith my \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d statement for my merit raise at UCLAW.\u201d\n\nProfessor Bainbridge provides the following background: \u201cAs regular readers know, I\u2019m up for a merit raise at UCLAW this year and am now required to submit a statement of how I contribute to the University\u2019s goals in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. I have just emailed the statement to the administration. It reads as follows\u201d:\n\nAlthough I am aware and respectful of the many dimensions within which a university properly seeks a diverse faculty and student body, I have long been particularly concerned with the lack of intellectual diversity at the law school. A survey of U.S. law professors in general found that white Democratic professors (both male and female), Jewish professors, and nonreligious professors \u201caccount for most (or all) of the overrepresentation among racial, gender, religious, and ideological groups in law teaching.\u201d[1] The groups that \u201caccount for most of the underrepresentation among racial, gender, religious, and ideological groups in law teaching\u201d are Republicans (both male and female), Protestants, and Catholics.[2] This disparity persists even though \u201creligious and political diversity are probably more important for viewpoint diversity than gender diversity and roughly as important as racial diversity.\u201d[3] At UCLA, we know that the campus as a whole leans substantially to the left. \u201cA study of various university faculties showed that at Cornell the ratio of liberal to conservative faculty members was 166 to 6, at Stanford it was 151 to 17, at UCLA it was 141 to 9, and at the University of Colorado it was 116 to 5.\u201d[4] Conservative students at UCLA have been \u201charassed, stalked, and threatened.\u201d[5] I recently searched the opensecrets.org donor database for political contributions made by persons who claimed UCLA School of Law as their employer. Thirty-eight of those persons contributed solely to Democratic candidates, the Democratic Party and various affiliates, and liberal PACs. One person contributed to both Republicans and Democrats. Three persons contributed exclusively to Republican candidates, the Republican Party, and various NRC affiliates. Of the faculty members who contributed exclusively to Republican candidates, the most recently hired of the two was hired in 1997. As a monetary matter, 92.67% of all contributions went to Democrats and affiliated groups.[6] Because conservative students and students of faith often feel alienated and estranged in an environment that is so relentlessly liberal and secular, I have made particular efforts to reach out to and support such students. I have served as a mentor for leaders of The Federalist Society and Christian Law Students Association. I have given talks to both organizations. I taught a Perspectives on law and Lawyering seminar devoted to Catholic Social Thought and the Law, which gave students\u2014whether Catholic or not\u2014an opportunity to consider how their faith (or lack thereof) related to the law and an opportunity to learn about a coherent body of Christian scholarship that might inform their lives as lawyers. I have also tried to lead by example, such as by serving as a volunteer with the Good Shepherd Catholic Church\u2019s St. Vincent de Paul chapter, which raises funds for distribution to poor persons who are in danger of losing their home due to inability to make rent or mortgage payments.\n\nMP: Kudos to Professor Bainbridge for writing a diversity statement that should be a template for other conservative and libertarian professors and job applicants who are increasingly being forced to produce these dangerous and troubling \u201cloyalty oaths\u201d in higher education for hiring and promotion that amount to dangerous political litmus tests for political ideology and conformity.\n\nRelated: See UC-Davis math professor Abigail Thompson\u2019s WSJ op-ed \u201cThe University\u2019s New Loyalty Oath\u201d and her original controversial essay on diversity statements that was featured on CD here.\n\nAnd I wrote last March on CD:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Diversity Statement"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 18:56:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/apple-touch-icon.png?v=69BgboyWbL", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "UCLA law professor Stephen Bainbridge's diversity statement | American Enterprise Institute - AEI", "description": "Stephen Bainbridge is the William D.
