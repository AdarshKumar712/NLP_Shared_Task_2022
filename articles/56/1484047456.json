Back before Mark Twain, American literature was kind of a who-you-know business, and the Alcotts knew everybody who was anybody in the author industry. Ralph Waldo Emerson lent her family the money to buy their house in Concord, Henry David Thoreau told them it was haunted, and they eventually sold it to Nathaniel Hawthorne.\n\nThe Decade\u2019s Top 10 Most Spectacular\n\nFalls From Grace 12 replies Posted by earlybird \u2014 Post Reply Anthony Weiner/Carlos Danger (2011, 2013, 2016) Of all the politicians to find themselves in a sexting scandal, it had to be the one whose last name is Weiner. In 2011, Anthony Weiner, the married representative from New York, resigned after being caught sending explicit photos of his genitalia to several young women, some underage. (Snip)Lois Lerner and the IRS Targeting Scandal (2013) The IRS decisions of which organizations gain tax-exempt status and which receive extensive scrutiny should have nothing to do with political orientation. However, in 2013, Lois Lerner, President Obama\u2019s director of Exempt Organization Unit in the IRS, disagreed, and disproportionately targeted conservative groups applying for 501(c) status exemptions.\n\nCensus Test Proves Asking About\n\nCitizenship Doesn\u2019t Scare Hispanics 7 replies Posted by earlybird \u2014 Post Reply This week, the Census Bureau released the results of its formal test of the once-proposed, and now prevented, census citizenship question. The results are a striking rebuke to a recent leftist orthodoxy: Adding a citizenship question to a test-run of the census had no statistically significant effect on overall response rates. Even in the communities most sensitive to the question, such as neighborhoods with many Hispanics, response rates dropped only slightly. To understand why this report is significant, step back to March 2018, when Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced that the 2020 census would include a question about citizenship status. Leftists were immediately outraged, seeing the addition as a racist\n\nTrump's offer Mexico could not refuse 4 replies Posted by earlybird \u2014 Post Reply Amid all the stories about President Donald John Trump's triumphs in 2019 -- exoneration from Mueller, 3.5% unemployment, killing al-Baghdadi, and a 33% rise in my 401-k -- having Mexico protect our border is way down on the list. Let me raise its profile because President Trump did the nearly impossible by getting Mexico to patrol our border. And he topped that by getting Mexico to keep people seeking asylum there until their cases are adjudicated. On May 30, as he prepared to leave for a state visit to England, President Trump told Mexico to either start patrolling our border and taking those asylum seekers by the time I get back, or\n\nIt Was A Very Good Year 6 replies Posted by earlybird \u2014 Post Reply Magicians always divert attention, which frees them to do their sleight of hand. President Donald John Trump has perfected the craft to the point where he has become the diversion. His tweets are red laser dots that the cats in the media chase. Real cats eventually catch on, but they continue to chase the dot. Benjamin Wofford of the Washingtonian noticed the dot in his column, \"While You Were Paying Attention to Ukraine, Here\u2019s What Trump\u2019s Appointees Achieved.\" He wrote, \"There were dozens of stories that flew under the radar\u2014policy changes and personnel sagas, norms eroded and scores settled\u2014that captured the essence of what happened in the marrow of Trump\u2019s government.\n\nTwo Highly Recommended Impeachment\n\nReads 2 replies Posted by earlybird \u2014 Post Reply Christopher Roach, an attorney, has published two articles on impeachment during the past two weeks. They're both excellent, clear expositions of the principles behind what's going on. While it's impossible for Roach to offer an entirely dispositive opinion on how Trump and the Senate should proceed--simply because political considerations will inevitably intrude--his discussion is conceptually useful. By presenting a clear conceptual framework and understanding of impeachment under our Constitution, we get a better idea how whatever path is chosen should be framed in order to stand with the principles of our constitutional order.\n\nMilitia supporters chanting \u2018Death to\n\nAmerica\u2019 break into U.S. Embassy compound\n\nin Baghdad 5 replies Posted by earlybird \u2014 Post Reply Supporters of an Iranian-backed militia besieged the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes, breaking through the first layer of security at the embassy compound and damaging a reception area before being expelled by Iraqi security forces. Here\u2019s what we know: \u25cfThe U.S. Defense Department is sending two Apache helicopters and a \u201csmall contingent\u201d of Marines to reinforce security at the embassy. \u25cfPresident Trump accused Iran of \u201corchestrating an attack\u201d on the embassy, where protesters ransacked a reception area and set fires. \u25cfIraqi security forces later intervened and set up a barricade, but protesters threw gasoline bombs into the compound.\n\nUS Embassy compound in Baghdad\n\ntargeted by mob protesting airstrikes;\n\nsit-in planned 9 replies Posted by earlybird \u2014 Post Reply Crowds of angry Iraqis protesting America\u2019s recent airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia laid siege to the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad Tuesday, chanting \u201cDown, Down USA!\u201d as they stormed through a main gate, prompting U.S. guards to fire back tear gas in response. As of Tuesday night, protesters set up tents outside the embassy in the Iraqi capital where they said they intended to stage a sit-in \u201cuntil American troops leave Iraq and the embassy is closed.\u201d About 100 Marines are being sent to the embassy to bolster security and an Army Apache helicopter flew over the premises and dropped flares in a \"show of force\", hoping to disburse\n\nWhy Americans Fear Trial By Jury 12 replies Posted by earlybird \u2014 Post Reply Everyone on both left and right these days is demanding rights\u2014but not the earliest and most important one, the historic right to trial by a jury of one\u2019s peers. Today, over 90 percent of American defendants waive that right in favor of a prosecutor\u2019s proposed plea bargain, because, as Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz notes in his new book Guilt by Association, they are warned that the penalty at the trial stage will be excessively higher. Dershowitz offers frightening examples. Two men picked up their uncle after committing a robbery, making him a passenger in a police car chase where a trooper was shot and killed. The actual murdering robbers copped a\n\nGreta Thunberg's father told her to launch\n\nclimate protests alone as he revealed\n\nactivism helped her depression 15 replies Posted by earlybird \u2014 Post Reply Greta Thunberg's father told her to launch her climate protests alone, as he said he and is wife made green changes to their lives to \"save\" their daughter from her depression. Svante Thunberg said he and his wife were \u201cnot climate activists\u201d but had stopped flying and turned vegan as they saw the impact it had on their daughter.(Snip)He said the teenager became acutely depressed after being diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome when she was 12, and stopped talking, eating or going to school for a year. \u201cShe stopped eating for three months,\u201d added Mr Thunberg. \u201cWhich is the ultimate nightmare for any parent.\u201d\n\nWill War Derail Trump\u2019s Reelection? 9 replies Posted by earlybird \u2014 Post Reply \u201cIt\u2019s tough to make predictions, especially about the future,\u201d Yogi Berra reminded us.(Snip)Looking to 2020, this writer predicted that Donald Trump\u2019s great domestic challenge would be to keep the economy firing on all cylinders. His great foreign policy challenge? Avoiding war. When one looks at the numbers \u2014 unemployment at or below 4% for two years, an expansion in its 11th year, the stock market regularly hitting all-time highs \u2014 Trump enters his reelection year with a fistful of aces.
