Include a good profile photograph. Your photo should look professional and be of good quality, and should not include other people. Add a background photo that highlights your personality and your brand.\n\n2. Add the right information. Avoid using nicknames or pet names in your LinkedIn profile. Your headline should be direct and specific. Add a summary that packs a punch, keywords relevant to your field and updated contact information to make it easier for potential employers to find you.\n\n3. Add relevant work experience. Not every job is relevant to potential employers. Try to include work experience that shows your skill in the field you are looking to enter.\n\n4. Show more than tell. Rather than using too many generic terms such as \u201cpassionate\u201d and \u201chard-working\u201d add a few achievements or describe your work to show potential employers what you can do, and set your profile apart from the rest.\n\n5. Stay active. Update your profile often. Keep track of your new projects, stay current and share new content.\n\n6. Do some research. Look through job listings for the type of employment you are looking for and add the listed skills to your profile. These are likely to be the skills that potential employers are looking for in a search.\n\n7. Grow your network. Grow your contacts list and get endorsements from others that will boost your profile.\n\nREAD MORE: Social media regulation in South Africa: new and upcoming law you must know about\n\nDo you have more information about the story?
