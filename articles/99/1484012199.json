Health Authority, as examples.\n\nMayor Roy is holding out hope that the long-awaited new acute-care hospital will be on its way to Weyburn, although he noted Prince Albert is also being promised one, and Weyburn split a $5 million fund with P.A. for planning in the spring budget.\n\n\u201cAlthough the city is part of the development for the hospital, it\u2019s the provincial government who will be building the hospital,\u201d said Mayor Roy, who pointed out that the Hospital Foundation here has done their fundraising work towards the cost of the new facility, while P.A. hasn\u2019t.\n\nIn the coming year, the mayor said there will be a lot of sidewalk projects done, and more infrastructure work, along with new welcoming signs at the entrance points to the city, and a replacement of the works shop, to replace the historic round house in the public works yard.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the biggest projects the city has had in the last 20 years or so,\u201d said Mayor Roy, of the projects done in 2019 and yet to come in 2020.\n\nThe council has been working on the budget, and the mayor said as of the time of the interview, the expectation was for a tax increase of around three per cent.\n\n\u201cIt was a somewhat tough budget,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery budget is tough, because we don\u2019t know how much money the province is giving us.\u201d\n\nHe added the city council is \u201cbudgeting differently than we did in the past. Usuallly they would wait for the provincial budget in May and go from there. Now, we do the budget earlier so we can get tenders out for projects for the year.\u201d\n\nThe hope is that by getting tenders and requests for proposal out early, they can get the best prices, and have contractors lined up to do the projects this year rather than hope they can do the projects later in the year.\n\nThe City also was part of the Weyburn Region Transportation Study, along with the RM of Weyburn and the Regional Planning Commission, with an information session held for the public on Oct. 29. The plan will help ensure the city and RM can develop a road network that can safely handle the traffic of the area generated by regional growth and development.\n\nThis is also an election year, with the municipal elections bumped to November as the provincial election is set for October.\n\n\u201cI look forward to it,\u201d said the mayor, who is planning to make another run for the mayor\u2019s chair.\n\nOverall, while there are challenges in the local economy, such as in the oil and gas sector, \u201cwe still have lots of optimism in the future of the community.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Greg Nikkel"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The City of Weyburn moved forward on a number of major projects this year, said Mayor Marcel Roy, and signs are positive for the coming year in 2020, in spite of the sagging economy in the province. . .", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/gmg/img/apple/WEYBURN_touch-icon-iphone.png", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "NOODP", "description": "The City of Weyburn moved forward on a number of major projects this year, said Mayor Marcel Roy, and signs are positive for the coming year in 2020, in spite of the sagging economy in the province. . .", "title": "City of Weyburn continues to grow and improve: Mayor Roy | Weyburn Review", "DC.title": "City of Weyburn continues to grow and improve: Mayor Roy", "author": "Greg Nikkel", "DC.creator": "Greg Nikkel", "section": "News", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Weyburn Review", "url": "https://www.weyburnreview.com/news/local-news/city-of-weyburn-continues-to-grow-and-improve-mayor-roy-1.24044198", "title": "City of Weyburn continues to grow and improve: Mayor Roy", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.24044201.1577814368!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/facebookogimage_560_292/new-school-construction.jpg", "width": 560, "height": 292}, "description": "The City of Weyburn moved forward on a number of major projects this year, said Mayor Marcel Roy, and signs are positive for the coming year in 2020, in spite of the sagging economy in the province. . ."}, "fb": {"app_id": 1592802300968767}, "article": {"section": "News", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Weyburn-Review/100299633382446"}, "twitter": {"site": "@WeyburnReview", "title": "City of Weyburn continues to grow and improve: Mayor Roy", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.24044201.1577814368!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/facebookogimage_560_292/new-school-construction.jpg", "description": "The City of Weyburn moved forward on a number of major projects this year, said Mayor Marcel Roy, and signs are positive for the coming year in 2020, in spite of the sagging economy in the province. . ."}, "msvalidate.01": "9CCB455B7FDA1B44FB0E618929FC0140"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.weyburnreview.com/news/local-news/city-of-weyburn-continues-to-grow-and-improve-mayor-roy-1.24044198"}
