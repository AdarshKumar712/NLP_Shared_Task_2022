One such key release is this second film version of the Bernstein/Laurents/Sondheim classic, directed by Steven Spielberg and written \u2013 apparently more faithfully to the original stage show than the 1961 movie \u2013 by Tony Kushner, with whom Spielberg previously collaborated on Lincoln. Ansel Elgort is a nagging concern as Tony; schoolgirl discovery Rachel Zegler plays Maria (having won the part via a Shallow audition tape).\n\nIn the Heights\n\nWhile we wait for the Hamilton movie, here\u2019s the long-gestating movie proper of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s previous hit, starring Anthony Ramos. It was supposed to have come out in 2011, but behind-the-cenes cast changes \u2013 including a Weinstein association \u2013 delayed first curtain.\n\nA talent for drag \u2026 Max Harwood in Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie\n\nEveryone\u2019s Talking About Jamie\n\nBilly Elliot meets Kinky Boots in this big-screen transfer for the West End hit about a Sheffield teenage boy with a talent for drag. The cast is mostly new to the production, from lead Max Harwood to supporting cast Richard E Grant, Sharon Horgan and Sarah Lancashire, but the show\u2019s creator and director, Jonathan Butterell, retains the reins.\n\nPrince of Cats\n\nHere\u2019s another loose spin on Romeo and Juliet, this time from Spike Lee, via Ron Wimberly\u2019s graphic novel set in the 80s in \u201cDa People\u2019s Republic of Brooklyn\u201d. Lakeith Stanfield was set to star as the rapping Tybalt but has since dropped out.\n\nAnnette\n\nAKA Marriage Story: the musical.
