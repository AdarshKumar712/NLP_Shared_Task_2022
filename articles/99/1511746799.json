How would he play it if his Baltimore Ravens and not the Kansas City Chiefs advanced to Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl LIV?\n\nLet him count the ways, as the NFL\u2019s AP Coach of the Year explained on the NFL Honors show\u2019s red carpet Saturday:\n\n1. \u201cYou have to play a perfect football game.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn the ball over.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep them bottled up in their end.\u201d\n\n4. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop the run.\u201d\n\n5. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep your eyes on the luggage. In other words, you\u2019ve got to keep your eyes on your guys, because they\u2019re going to be running across the field with a great deal of speed and Jimmy (Garoppolo) can hit them. They\u2019re a tough team to defend.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh\u2019s Ravens beat the 49ers 20-17 on Dec. 1, and he beat the 49ers seven years ago in the Super Bowl when they were coached by his brother Jim.\n\n\u201cI wish it would have been us winning one year and him winning the next year,\u201d John Harbaugh said. \u201cAs great as it felt for us and our team, I felt bad for him and his family. You want to see him do well.\n\n\u201cJim\u2019s an amazing coach. He did an amazing job. He really put the 49ers back on the map and helped them build that stadium.\u201d\n\nJim Harbaugh nearly did lead the 49ers back to the Super Bowl only to lose in the 2013 season\u2019s NFC Championship Game, his penultimate season before leaving to coach at his alma mater, Michigan.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a great job everywhere he\u2019s been. That (Har-Bowl) is a great memory. It\u2019ll never happen again, I think. Maybe it will. It\u2019s still special.\u201d\n\nMARIUCCI MARVELS AT OFFENSE\n\nSteve Mariucci, the 49ers\u2019 coach from 1997-2002, said the score could dictate what plan of attack the 49ers deploy.\n\n\u201cJimmy G\u2019s going to have to throw it more than eight times,\u201d Mariucci said referring to Garoppolo\u2019s 6-of-8 passing stats in the NFC Championship win. \u201cBut they run the ball so darn well.\u201d\n\nMariucci took the 49ers to the playoffs in 4 of 6 seasons, and he admires how well Shanahan has converted the franchise back into a contender.\n\nFormer #49ers coach @SteveMariucci is pulling for Lynch and BY. Funny how that works out with Lynch as his Bucs ended Mooch\u2019s tenure in 2002 playoffs with 31-6 loss pic.twitter.com/ftiEmkB3Yf \u2014 Cam Inman (@CamInman) February 1, 2020\n\n\u201cI love the fact they came from 4-12 last year,\u201d Mariucci said. \u201cNow, your quarterback gets hurt (as Garoppolo did in 2018 Week 3). We\u2019ve all seen that before: I remember when Steve Young got hurt. It\u2019s hard to lose not only your quarterback but your mojo.\n\n\u201cI try to look at the bright side of things. Had Jimmy G not gotten hurt, they don\u2019t get to draft Bosa and they\u2019re drafting later and I don\u2019t know who they draft.\u201d Related Articles Close calls don\u2019t go 49ers way in Super Bowl LIV loss to Kansas City\n\nFive Super Bowl LIV plays that cost 49ers a victory over Kansas City\n\nWhat might\u2019ve been: 49ers\u2019 would-be unsung heroes in wake of Super Bowl collapse\n\n49ers report card: Who failed most in Super Bowl collapse to Chiefs?\n\nVideo: Bay Area News Group reporters Cam Inman and Dieter Kurtenbach break down the San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl loss\n\nCOWHER SEES DIFFERENCES\n\nRecently elected Hall of Fame coach Bill Cowher gushed over what a great matchup this is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a contrast of offenses. You have the (49ers\u2019) running game against the (Chiefs\u2019) passing game,\u201d Cowher said. \u201cThese are the two best teams in the league.\n\n\u201cI love the fact there\u2019s so many different ways of doing it and you\u2019re seeing it in their journeys to this game. It\u2019s going to be a back and forth game.\u201d\n\nCowher wouldn\u2019t reveal his pick.\n\n\u201cSan Francisco can play a shootout. They showed it against New Orleans (a 48-46 win Dec. 8). If you don\u2019t stop the run, they won\u2019t quit running. I love their style.\n\n\u201cBut I like Andy (Reid). He\u2019s going to want to throw it around. It\u2019s going to be a fast field and a great matchup.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Inside Sports"], "authors": ["Cam Inman", "Cam Inman Joined The Bay Area News Group In", "Specializing In The", "Nfl Since"], "publish_date": "Sun Feb  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.eastbaytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/32x32-ebt.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"application-name": "eastbaytimes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "wp-parsely_version": "1.14", "fb": {"pages": 17088540698}, "google-site-verification": "u5NZtugcTf_14hKIebRYYsDms05ZEjV60G0INS-jyew", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "How do Harbaugh, Mariucci, Cowher see 49ers in Super Bowl?", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/how-do-harbaugh-mariucci-cowher-see-49ers-in-super-bowl", "description": "John Harbaugh, Steve Mariucci and Bill Cowher scout Super Bowl LIV from a coaching perspective before the 49ers take on the Chiefs.", "site_name": "East Bay Times", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.eastbaytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/20130201_112043_nhatharbaugh-1.jpg?w=400&h=300", "width": 400, "height": 300}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-02T12:00:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-02T12:38:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@eastbaytimes", "text": {"title": "How do Harbaugh, Mariucci, Cowher see 49ers in Super Bowl?"}, "image": "https://www.eastbaytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/20130201_112043_nhatharbaugh-1.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.eastbaytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/32x32-ebt.png?w=32"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.mercurynews.com/how-do-harbaugh-mariucci-cowher-see-49ers-in-super-bowl"}
