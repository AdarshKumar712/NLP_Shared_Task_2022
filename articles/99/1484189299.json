Perhaps most important, the study found that industry has thousands of open jobs and boasts a relatively high average salary, at $83,358 \u2014 critical in a high-cost area like Long Island.\n\nAt the same time, however, the industry suffers from a perception problem. It lacks the advocacy that regional business groups bring to other areas of the economy, like real estate development and finance, and unlike the building trades it lacks the support system and educational pipeline to assure that young, skilled workers will be ready to fill the thousands of job openings that exist even now.\n\nThose jobs aren't the widget-making jobs of decades ago. Today, local manufacturers are utilizing robotics and artificial intelligence. Today, they're innovators and engineers. One company on the Island makes and exports tortellini to foreign nations, another makes military-style aircraft seats for military and commercial customers. Going forward, the local manufacturing industry plans to expand its base to include support for offshore wind projects.\n\nTo fill the needs, Long Island's community colleges and BOCES facilities have to develop the right certification and professional development programs. They will need to connect with the region's manufacturers to make sure their students' skills meet the companies' requirements. There are models in other parts of the state where successful apprenticeship programs are bridging the gap between student and employee. Additional workforce training, internships and even high school field trips would help both young workers and the companies that hope to employ them, by exposing potential future employees to the opportunities Long Island's manufacturers offer.\n\nBut both educators and industry leaders need support. Some advocates have suggested Long Island needs its own region-wide manufacturing association or organization. That might be unnecessary in an area where there are already plenty of business groups, and smaller, more specific industrial organizations, especially if the existing organizations expand their reach to highlight and work with the manufacturing sector.\n\nSign up for The Point Go inside New York politics.

That number is now down to 5%, but with the right strategy and spotlight, Long Island has the chance to create more jobs in new industries that can represent the region's future, as much as its past.\n\n\u2014 The editorial board", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "publish_date": "Sun Dec 29 17:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "It's easy to think Long Island is no longer the land of manufacturing.\u00a0 With the end of high-profile companies like Grumman Corp., and the growth of other key\u00a0sectors\u00a0like health care and finance, the", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/img/newsday/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=100%,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "It's easy to think Long Island is no longer the land of manufacturing.\u00a0 With the end of high-profile companies like Grumman Corp., and the growth of other key\u00a0sectors\u00a0like health care and finance, the", "msvalidate.01": "AC41EB10D1EC6B5358F0ECA0E861CCAA", "google-site-verification": "WS-IPs_DqbPtrQ9XhKPi_32a-1spE4tjsjhWUqwVVns", "application-name": "Newsday", "msapplication-TileColor": "#1B3664", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/newsday/nd-win8-icon.png", "p": {"domain_verify": "b22f651177478af415d53d6eb00b8167"}, "fb": {"pages": 19175874448, "app_id": 147686468041}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.newsday.com/facebook/opinion/editorial/jobs-long-island-manufacturing-labor-unions-1.39900951"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "news_keywords": "newsday,editorial,source,opinion", "og": {"title": "Spotlight on manufacturing", "url": "https://www.newsday.com/opinion/editorial/jobs-long-island-manufacturing-labor-unions-1.39900951", "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.39900952.1577467318!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.jpg", "site_name": "Newsday", "description": "It's easy to think Long Island is no longer the land of manufacturing.\u00a0 With the end of high-profile companies like Grumman Corp., and the growth of other key\u00a0sectors\u00a0like health care and finance, the", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Newsday", "title": "Spotlight on manufacturing", "description": "It's easy to think Long Island is no longer the land of manufacturing.\u00a0 With the end of high-profile companies like Grumman Corp., and the growth of other key\u00a0sectors\u00a0like health care and finance, the", "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.39900952.1577467318!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.jpg", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 358571317, "ipad": 358571317, "googleplay": "com.pagesuite.newsday"}}}, "sailthru.date": "Sun, 29 Dec 2019 17:00:00 -0500", "sailthru.title": "Spotlight on manufacturing", "sailthru.tags": "newsday,editorial,source,opinion", "sailthru.author": "The Editorial Board", "isDesktop": "true"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.newsday.com/opinion/editorial/jobs-long-island-manufacturing-labor-unions-1.39900951"}
