The investigation has yet to reach a conclusion.\n\nLab chief Brig Ahmed Al Serkal spoke of the case as he gave The National a tour of the facilities this week. He said the tragedy was one of five cases involving the use of hydrogen sulph ide-based pesticides.\n\nThe unit of 46 investigators and technicians was also involved in the investigation of an industrial chlorine leak in February that killed one person and left more than 70 needing treatment.\n\n\u201cOur on-site management plan for a chlorine leakage that affected 73 people in Sharjah\u2019s industrial area helped contain the disaster,\u201d Brig Al Serkal said.\n\nThe department spent years adding samples of evidence from crime scenes, prisoners and suspects to its DNA database and there are now 6,412 people listed.\n\nThe investment has paid off and the lab has helped to solve crimes using 164 DNA matches.\n\nEmergency services respond to a chlorine gas leak that killed one person and left more than 70 in need of treatment in May\n\nThe unit's experts find their time increasingly taken up by drug cases.\n\nToxicology expert Idris Mohammed said the lab\u2019s up-to-date equipment tests for traces when suspects have tried to cover up their drug use or flush it from their system.\n\n\u201cNo one can get away with it, no matter what interfering agents they use to mask drugs in their urine or blood,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Taj Abbas, a chemist, said the forensics team had come across all manner of smuggling techniques, including the smuggling of \"gold in dough, inside protein powder, or [drugs] in the form of candy tin boxes, smuggling drugs inside sesame seeds \" .\n\nThough gun crimes are rare in the Emirates, the unit developed a residue programme to analyse bullet fragments and the traces of gunpowder on an assailant 's hands and clothing.\n\nIn a country in which cheques are still widely used, forgeries remain relatively common.\n\n\u201cWe've solved many forgery cases, including altering passports, educational degrees, cheques, among others and I see that criminals are always one step ahead,\u201d said anti-forgery technician Sayyed Shaaban.\n\nThe unit also provides a range of career paths to bright, young science graduates.\n\nNoura Jaleel, who has a degree in biotechnology, is among the few Emiratis in the unit.\n\nShe called on young people with an interest in science to embrace the chance to work in a different field.\n\n\u201cIt's not all about dead bodies,\" she told The National. \"It's a wide and extremely interesting science offering new developments and challenges everyday.\"\n\nHer colleague, Aisha Al Tunaiji, who joined five months ago, said she each day fascinates her .\n\n\u201cI love the work and I want to learn more.
