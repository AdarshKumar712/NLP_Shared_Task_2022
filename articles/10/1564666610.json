However, the Foreign Ministry's decision to say the ban on those American journalists also applied to Hong Kong and Macau was a bad move as it has so much to do with the \"one country, two systems\" arrangement for the two SARs.\n\nThe ill-conceived move by the ministry has created a difficult situation for Hong Kong - it's not as difficult for Macau which is less international than we are here.\n\nThat difficulty is evident in Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's inability to address some legitimate questions in relation to the ban.\n\nMute in the beginning, she's now speaking up declaring that she could not possibly predict who would be allowed to work here as she referenced the immigration policy that every application is treated individually.\n\nThe reply was not satisfactory. She clearly tried to confine the cases to the remit of Hong Kong's immigration policy that is supposed to form part of the SAR's high degree of autonomy.\n\nThat's all she could say.\n\nUnfortunately, this still falls short of addressing the concern that a local matter could readily become a foreign affairs matter. And when a line should have been defined with clarity, it became blurred instead.\n\nCan Lam answer that concern? Perhaps only those in the Foreign Ministry can.\n\nThe ministry has been rather dramatic these days with a bewildering array of incidents.\n\nIf Global Times' Hu Xijin was known for his often radical commentaries, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has proved he's more than a match for Hu because the latter - despite his combative mockery of the United States - has never been as successful as Zhao in creating a diplomatic storm.\n\nAngry that the world hasn't been thankful to Beijing amid the coronavirus pandemic, Zhao dropped the bombshell alleging sick US soldiers were cuplrits of the virus that began in Wuhan. His predecessor, Cui Tianhai - currently the Chinese ambassador to the United States - had to clear the mess saying Zhao's tweet didn't represent the central government's point of view.\n\nHu is no match for Zhao because, while Hu is a man of the media, Zhao is an official spokesman of the Foreign Ministry.\n\nIt appears that Zhao has since gone into hibernation. Is the ministry making an adjustment to its policy towards the United States? If so, should it also adjust its ill-conceived decision to involve Hong Kong in the Sino-US diplomatic row?", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["the real sick man of asia", "wall street journal", "american journalists", "diplomatic war", "foreign ministry", "global times", "zhao lijian"], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Standard"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A Wall Street Journal commentary calling China \"the real sick man of Asia\" outraged Beijing so much that it immediately kicked out...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thestandard.com.hk/images/webIcon.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "keywords": "the real sick man of asia, wall street journal, american journalists, diplomatic war, foreign ministry, global times, zhao lijian", "author": "The Standard", "publisher": "The Standard", "distribution": "global", "og": {"site_name": "The Standard", "url": "https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/17/217772/HK-in-middle-of-murky-media-move", "locale": "en_US", "title": "HK in middle of murky media move", "description": "A Wall Street Journal commentary calling China &quot;the real sick man of Asia&quot; outraged Beijing so much that it immediately kicked out three of its reporters out of the country after the newspap...", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.thestandard.com.hk/newsImage/20200401/50048976contentPhoto1.jpg?1585872971"}, "description": "A Wall Street Journal commentary calling China &quot;the real sick man of Asia&quot; outraged Beijing so much that it immediately kicked out...", "fb": {"article_style": "default"}, "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "HK in middle of murky media move", "description": "A Wall Street Journal commentary calling China &quot;the real sick man of Asia&quot; outraged Beijing so much that it immediately kicked out three of its reporters out of the country after the newspap...", "image": "https://www.thestandard.com.hk/newsImage/20200401/50048976contentPhoto1.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/17/217772/HK-in-middle-of-murky-media-move"}
