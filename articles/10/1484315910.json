Rather than suggest that people losing their homes, and even their lives, Morrison suggested that the biggest tragedy for Cobargo was dairy farmers having to pour milk down a hill due to blackouts shutting off refrigerated storage.\n\n\u201cIn particular, down in Cobargo and places like that, where dairies have been milking and they simply have to pour the milk down the hill because of the lack of power to those areas at this time. That is the tragedy of what is occurring as a result of these disasters.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE Scotty From Marketing Spent Yesterday Faffing About With Cricketers\n\nIn a remarkably defensive and at times visibly angry appearance, Morrison repeatedly passed the buck of immediate fire response onto the states \u2013 though he did assert Commonwealth assistance was being made available whenever it was needed.\n\nThe Prime Minister was repeatedly grilled on the links between climate change and the conditions that have severely exacerbated fire conditions, and it was on this issue that he became visibly annoyed.\n\nTersely, he snapped \u201cWhat we will do is make sure our policies remain sensible, that they don\u2019t move towards either extreme, and stay focused on what Australians need for a vibrant and viable economy, as well as a vibrant and sustainable environment. Getting the balance right is what Australia has always been able to achieve.\u201d\n\nShortly after that, he closed his response off with a curt \u201cthank you very much,\u201d before storming off and ending the press conference.\n\nThe Prime Minister did not field any question, nor did he provide comment on, his extraordinarily ill-timed Hawaii holiday, nor his reported past 24 hours spent entertaining a variety of guests at Kirribilli House.\n\nAll in a day\u2019s work for Scotty, folks.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 02:47:37 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Scott Morrison finally fronted media in an at-times testy press conference where he repeatedly placed the onus of bushfire response on the states.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2017/07/cropped-Pez-Circle-Black-RGB-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Scott Morrison finally fronted media in an at-times testy press conference where he repeatedly placed the onus of bushfire response on the states.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Scott Morrison Says The Real Tragedy Of The Fires Is Milk Being Poured Down A Hill", "description": "The PM repeatedly placed the onus of fire response onto the states.", "url": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/scott-morrison-milk-fires-press-conference/", "site_name": "Pedestrian TV", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2020/01/morrison-milk.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2020/01/morrison-milk.jpg", "width": 636, "height": 397}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pedestriandottv/", "tag": "Fires", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-01-02T02:47:37+11:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1445402502149319, "pages": 158215867416}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The PM repeatedly placed the onus of fire response onto the states.", "title": "Scott Morrison Said The Tragedy Of The Fires Is Milk Being Poured Out", "site": "@pedestriandaily", "image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2020/01/morrison-milk.jpg", "creator": "@camtyeson"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2017/07/cropped-Pez-Circle-Black-RGB-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/scott-morrison-milk-fires-press-conference/"}
