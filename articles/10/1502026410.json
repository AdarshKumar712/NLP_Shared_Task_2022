people were killed on Wednesday when suspected nomadic Misseriya herders from Sudan attacked a village in the disputed oil-rich region of Abyei along the border of South Sudan, a local official said.\n\nAbyei has been contested since South Sudan gained independence in 2011, while there have long been tensions between the South Sudanese Ngok Dinka community and the Misseriya herders who traverse the area looking for grazing.\n\nKuol Alor Kuol, the chief administrator of the Abyei area, told AFP that heavily armed Misseriya and allied militia attacked the village of Kolom early on Wednesday.\n\n\"Thirty-two people were killed among them children and women, and secondly about 24 people are wounded ... and about 15 people including children were abducted and 20 houses burned,\" Kuol said.\n\nHe said the wounded had been evacuated to a hospital in the town of Agok which is run by Doctors Without Borders (MSF).\n\nIn 2011, the UN Security Council deployed a peacekeeping force to the area after deadly clashes displaced some 100 000 people.\n\nThe United Nations Interim Security Force in Abyei (UNISFA) is made up entirely of Ethiopian troops, with some 4 500 soldiers on the ground.\n\nUNISFA could not be immediately reached for comment on the attack.\n\nThe UN Security Council in 2018 warned that the situation in Abyei and along the Sudan-South Sudan border \"continues to constitute a serious threat to international peace,\" and called on the two countries to show concrete progress on border demarcation and monitoring.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["south
