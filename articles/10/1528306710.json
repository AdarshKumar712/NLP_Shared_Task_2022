Three of the properties raided belonged to automotive supplier Continental, which is listed as a witness in the case.\n\nThe investigation is focusing on Mitsubishi diesel vehicles with 1.6- and 2.2-liter engines that adhere to Germany's highest Euro 5 and Euro 6 ratings, for meeting certain environmental standards.\n\nRead more: Stuttgart to introduce diesel driving ban in 2019\n\nProsecutors said in a statement that \"there is a suspicion that the engines are equipped with a so-called shutdown device\" that makes the emissions appear lower than they actually are.\n\nThe Japanese automobile manufacturer is also part of a business alliance with Renault and Nissan.\n\nRead more: Carlos Ghosn claims put a spotlight on Japan's legal system\n\nThe raids are the latest instance in an ongoing set of scandals \u2014 dubbed Dieselgate \u2014 over emissions cheating. In 2015, Volkswagen admitted to installing software in 11 million diesel-fuelled vehicles to pass emissions tests. The devices allowed the vehicles to emit up to 40 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxide.\n\nThe probe is a first for Mitsubishi with regard to emissions cheating. However, in 2016, the carmaker admitted to publishing exaggerated mileage ratings for car models that it sold in Japan.\n\nWatch video 01:35 Share Volkswagen appears in court in Germany Send Facebook google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3QVcM Volkswagen appears in court in Germany\n\nEvery evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.
