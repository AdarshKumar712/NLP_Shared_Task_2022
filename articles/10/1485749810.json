It was not a paper known to anyone, and its front page featured a smartly dressed man frozen in curvilinear form, having just flung himself from a second-story roof onto the cement sidewalk below. \u201cA man in space!\u201d the headline proclaimed, announcing the newcomer\u2019s victory over the heated international space race. \u201cThe painter of space leaps into the void!\u201d\n\nYves Klein Harry Shunk The man was avant-garde artist, and it was his own satirical publication featuring his now-famous image Leap into the Void (1960). It was easy, at the time, to take the photograph at face value\u2014that Klein was abandoning himself to gravity. In truth, Klein\u2019s wife and friends were holding a tarpaulin to catch his falling body. The magician\u2019s illusion was executed off the scene by photographersand Jean Kender. In a darkroom, they composited an image of the empty street with one of the artist\u2019s fall.\n\nRobert Frank Henri Cartier-Bresson Leap into the Void was unprecedented in photography. While photographers likeandused \u201cstraight\u201d photography to seek emotional truths, Klein harnessed the inherent malleability of the medium\u2019s veracity. Leap was a modern-day legend. For decades after his untimely death in 1962, the story behind the image was hotly disputed, and some accounts still differ today.\n\nKlein would have never admitted to trickery, though he was winking between every line of his newspaper. \u201cToday the painter of space must, in fact, go into space to paint, but he must go there without trickery or deception,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe must be capable of levitation.\u201d\n\nKlein\u2019s career only spanned about seven years, but he was a temerarious figure in the art world. He was best known for his monochromatic paintings with the ultramarine pigment he eventually registered, International Klein Blue (IKB), and his avant-garde high jinks. He published an art catalogue of non-existent paintings. He had nude models cover themselves in IKB and print their own bodies on paper. While they did so, an orchestra played a single note for 20 minutes, followed by 20 minutes of silence. For his last act, he had a series of heart attacks at age 34, the first during the screening of a film in which his role had been cut.\n\n\u201cKlein was clever and charismatic\u2014a mystic and a mythmaker who beguiled his admirers with the prospect of transcending the material limitations of earthly life,\u201d Mia Fineman wrote in the Metropolitan Museum of Art \u2019s exhibition catalogue for the 2012 show \u201cFaking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop,\u201d which included his famed image.\n\nKlein\u2019s Leap wasn\u2019t his first dally with the concept of the void. In 1958, in a show known as \u201cThe Void\u201d at Iris Clert Gallery in Paris, the only object in the gallery was a cabinet that Klein had emptied. As a parting gift, gallerygoers went home to discover that the IKB-hued cocktails they\u2019d been served came out blue on the other end, too.\n\nThe artist\u2019s fascination with the void came from his training in judo, which he studied fervorously to earn a fourth-degree black belt. He trained at Tokyo\u2019s Kodokan Judo Institute in 1953, and he became infatuated with the Japanese Buddhist idea of an infinite expanse of nothingness.\n\nKlein reportedly didn\u2019t take the leap into the void just once, but multiple times. Before photographers Shunk and Kender were present, Klein claimed to have tested it on his own with no one to break his fall. On the day of, he jumped many times in the Paris suburb of Fontenay-aux-Roses, practicing the arc of his body and testing different elements in the scene.\n\n\u201cThere were three versions in the end,\u201d Shunk relayed to the London Times at a later date. \u201cOne with a bike, one with Yves\u2019s car, and one with nothing. He immediately decided that the official version should be one with the bike, but then he also sent out the other one. But never the one with the car; he hated the car because it was cheap.\u201d\n\nThough the performance and newspaper were saturated in irony, Klein was serious about keeping the illusion in tact: Shunk said he was threatened with legal action if he ever pulled back the Ozian curtain. The mysteries of the photograph weren\u2019t fully revealed until two shows in 2010 delved into the making of the image. One of them, at the Menil Collection in Houston, even had the Holy Grail: a piece of slate purported to be from the roof from which Klein jumped.\n\nKlein\u2019s Leap reveals more than an illusionist\u2019s trick, but the very nature of photography that we often forget, no matter how many doctored images we see today. \u201cConvincing to the eye if not to the mind, Klein\u2019s Leap symbolically enacts the leap of faith we make in accepting the truth of any photograph,\u201d Fineman writes, \u201cacknowledging both the pleasures and the perils involved in the willing suspension of disbelief.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Photography", "Jacqui Palumbo"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jacqui Palumbo", "Elyssa Goodman", "Alina Cohen"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 19:30:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "It was easy, at the time, to take the photograph at face value\u2014that Klein was abandoning himself to gravity.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://d1s2w0upia4e9w.cloudfront.net/images/icon-152.png", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=703796080, app-argument=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-yves-klein-tricked-iconic-photograph", "msapplication-config": "https://d1s2w0upia4e9w.cloudfront.net/images/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 7961740, "app_id": 308278682573501, "pages": 342443413406}, "description": "It was easy, at the time, to take the photograph at face value\u2014that Klein was abandoning himself to gravity.", "og": {"site_name": "Artsy", "title": "How Yves Klein Tricked the World with This Iconic Photograph", "url": "https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-yves-klein-tricked-iconic-photograph", "type": "article", "published_time": "2020-01-02T19:30:00.000Z", "description": "It was easy, at the time, to take the photograph at face value\u2014that Klein was abandoning himself to gravity.", "image": "https://artsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/vmnsx8a-0BBA7UHCtpBjhw%2Fcustom-Custom_Size___yves-klein-saut-dans-le-vide-1960+%281%29.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-02T19:30:00.000Z", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/artsy/", "tag": "Photography, Jacqui Palumbo"}, "twitter": {"site": "@artsy", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-yves-klein-tricked-iconic-photograph", "description": "It was easy, at the time, to take the photograph at face value\u2014that Klein was abandoning himself to gravity.", "image": "https://artsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/vmnsx8a-0BBA7UHCtpBjhw%2Fcustom-Custom_Size___yves-klein-saut-dans-le-vide-1960+%281%29.jpg", "title": "How Yves Klein Tricked the World with This Iconic Photograph"}, "sailthru.date": "2020-01-02T19:30:00.000Z", "sailthru.title": "How Yves Klein Tricked the World with This Iconic Photograph", "sailthru.author": "Jacqui Palumbo", "sailthru.image.full": "https://d7hftxdivxxvm.cloudfront.net?resize_to=fill&src=https%3A%2F%2Fartsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2F_fchMHhEgAT6A7-4pwocVQ%252Fcustom-Custom_Size___yves-klein-saut-dans-le-vide-1960.jpg&width=1200&height=800&quality=95", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://d7hftxdivxxvm.cloudfront.net?resize_to=fill&src=https%3A%2F%2Fartsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2F_fchMHhEgAT6A7-4pwocVQ%252Fcustom-Custom_Size___yves-klein-saut-dans-le-vide-1960.jpg&width=600&height=400&quality=95", "sailthru.tags": "article, Photography, Jacqui Palumbo, magazine", "news_keywords": "Photography, Jacqui Palumbo", "keywords": "Photography, Jacqui Palumbo", "author": "Jacqui Palumbo"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-yves-klein-tricked-iconic-photograph"}
