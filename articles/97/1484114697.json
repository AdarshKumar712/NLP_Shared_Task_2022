(AP) \u2013 Police in North Carolina are urging owners of short-term rentals to register their properties so police can more quickly shut down parties that get out of hand.\n\nThe Charlotte Observer reported Wednesday that registrations will help police know who owns a property when they respond to a 911 call.\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Police said at a recent news conference that there have been \u201ca number\u201d of incidents where an AirBnB looks like \u201ca nightclub in a condo or an apartment or even a residence.\u201d\n\nThe department has compiled a list of 50 short-term rental properties where officers have responded to 911 calls.\n\nBut police say there are likely more.\n\n(Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
