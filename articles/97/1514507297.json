There are calls for fresh regional elections in Thuringia, but Chancellor Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU) are resisting that option.\n\nThe CDU and its coalition partner in the national government, the Social Democrats (SPD), will hold crisis talks at the weekend.\n\nIt is the first time in post-war Germany that a leader has been helped into office by the far right. Mainstream parties officially oppose any deals with the AfD, which has grown to become the main opposition party.\n\nMore on Germany\u2019s AfD\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Is Germany\u2019s AfD racist?\n\nRND reports that the Thuringia premier gets a base monthly salary of \u20ac16,617 gross, plus \u20ac766 in allowances.\n\nIn addition, as a married man Mr Kemmerich is entitled to a \u20ac153 family allowance, making a total of \u20ac17,537.\n\nUnder Thuringia law, one day in office is treated the same as a month, and Mr Kemmerich is also entitled to a six-month transitional allowance after stepping down.\n\nFor the first three months that allowance would be paid in full, and in half for the next three months.\n\nRND reports that his transitional allowance alone would total \u20ac75,468.\n\nOrdinary MPs in the Thuringia parliament get a monthly base salary of \u20ac5,803.
