The measure has outraged many. As a public health professional and uncle to 10- and 12-year-old nieces, it seems like a no-brainer.\n\nMany comments against the measure seem to be fueled by misinformation. As a sexual and reproductive health researcher, I\u2019d like to debunk common myths about HPV and the vaccine. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted disease. It affects about 1 in 4 Americans. It is usually transmitted through sex, but can pass from person to person through close skin-to-skin contact. About 70% to 80% of people with HPV clear the infection on their own and won\u2019t know they had it.\n\nWhile many people are concerned about the sexual transmission of HPV, the importance of the vaccine is as a cancer-fighting tool. There are more than 100 types of HPV. Some cause warts on hands, feet and genitals. Others cause cells to abnormally change, which may lead to cancer in the cervix, vagina and vulva in women, penis in men, and the anus and back of the throat in both women and men. These cancers can take years to develop which is why the vaccine is recommended for youth. Anyone age 9 to 45 is eligible.\n\nNow that it\u2019s clear what HPV is and how it is transmitted, let\u2019s examine a few myths.\n\nMyth 1: My children aren\u2019t having sex, why give them the vaccine?\n\nThe vaccine works best if it is given before someone becomes sexually active and is exposed to HPV. Research shows that adolescents and young teens create more antibodies to the vaccine than those in their late teens. Antibodies destroy the vaccine germs and then stay in the body, providing immunity. Because young people can produce a lot of antibodies, they only need two doses while those over 15 will need three doses of the vaccine.\n\nMyth 2: My child will have sex earlier if the vaccine is administered.\n\nThere is no research suggesting preteens and teens will have sex because they feel the protection from the vaccine. It is important, especially when young people don\u2019t receive comprehensive school-based sexual and reproductive health education, to educate them about sexual health because the vaccine protects against HPV and no other STDs. Research shows that those who get the vaccine are more aware of the risks of condomless sex and STDs.\n\nSign up for The Point Go inside New York politics.

It can cause major side effects and death.\n\nSide effects like pain, redness at the injection site, or a reaction if someone is allergic to a vaccine ingredient, are not unheard of and are possible with any vaccine. While death is possible, only two of the seven reported HPV vaccine deaths between 2014-2017 were medically verified (out of 28 million doses).\n\nMyth 4: It\u2019s unlikely one vaccine can protect against different cancers.\n\nThe HPV vaccines are noninfectious and contain \u201cvirus-like\u201d particles. There are three HPV vaccines: 2vHPV (for females only), 4vHPV, and 9vHPV, all of which target different types of HPV. The 4vHPV and 9vHPV are approved for males because they protect against genital warts, whereas the 2vHPV does not.\n\nThis might seem new and confusing in the United States, but other countries have done this for some time. The Australian government\u2019s school-based HPV vaccine program has seen substantial decreases in cervical disease and genital warts. If there was a lung-cancer- or brain-cancer-prevention vaccine, people would line up at the doctor\u2019s office to get it. Let\u2019s not make the HPV vaccine debate about sex. It\u2019s about disease prevention.\n\nAnthony J.
