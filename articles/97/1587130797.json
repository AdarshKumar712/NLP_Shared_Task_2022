She has always denied any wrongdoing.\n\nOn the heels of a Reuters report that Maxwell was the main focus of an investigation by the FBI into several \u201cpeople who facilitated\u201d the dead pedophile\u2019s alleged sexual abuse, a source tells Page Six: \u201cGhislaine is protected. She and Jeffrey were assets of sorts for multiple foreign governments. They would trade information about the powerful people caught in his net \u2014 caught at Epstein\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nThe source added of Ghislaine, who has homes in Manhattan and London, \u201cShe is not in the US, she moves around. She is sometimes in the UK, but most often in other countries, such as Israel, where her powerful contacts have provided her with safe houses and protection.\u201d\n\nThe source added that Britain\u2019s disgraced Prince Andrew had begged Maxwell to come forward and give an interview to protect him after he was accused of having sex with one of Epstein\u2019s most vocal accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, which he strongly denies. But Maxwell refused, forcing the prince to conduct his own disastrous interview. The source said: \u201cAndrew pleaded with Ghislaine to publicly defend him. She carefully considered it, but decided no good would come of it (if she came forward). It isn\u2019t in her best interests.\u201d Lawyers for Maxwell didn\u2019t get back to us.\n\nThe source also added, \u201cIf the US government was really interested in bringing in Ghislaine, the IRS would have looked at her tax returns and the income she may have got from Epstein and perhaps some of his powerful associates.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Page Six", "ghislaine maxwell", "jeffrey epstein"], "tags": ["ghislaine maxwell", "jeffrey epstein"], "authors": ["Emily Smith", "January"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Ghislaine Maxwell \u2014 the British socialite who\u2019s long been accused of serving as Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s madam \u2014 is hiding in a series of safe houses.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/nypost-2016/static/images/apple-icons/pagesix/apple-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
