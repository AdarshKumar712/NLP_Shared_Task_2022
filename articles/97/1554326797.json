And 42,000 respirator masks. More than 40,000 disposable exam gloves, and 6,000 isolation gowns.\n\nBut it might have to take what it can get, when it can get it.\n\nA single supplier responded to the bid for N95 respirator masks, offering to sell pallets \u2014 or 3,840 masks \u2014 for $1,171. But it can\u2019t guarantee delivery, said Bob Walla, the city\u2019s purchasing agent.\n\nAnd the same Illinois company was the one only to bite on the hand sanitizer bid, with a quote for more than $46,000. The city accepted the offer \u2014 and the mayor signed an executive order Tuesday \u2014 but the sanitizer won\u2019t come anytime soon.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["", "coronavirus", "city of lincoln", "lincoln-lancaster county health department", "personal protective equipment", "health-care", "medical", "local-government", "employee", "scott holmes", "commerce", "medicine", "gown", "delivery", "bob walla", "bryan", "glove"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Peter Salter Lincoln Journal Star", "Courtesy Photo"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The city of Lincoln tried to stock up on personal protection equipment last week, issuing a series of emergency bid requests seeking supplies to keep its employees safe.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://columbustelegram.com/content/tncms/site/icon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": ", coronavirus, city of lincoln, lincoln-lancaster county health department, personal protective equipment, health-care, medical, local-government, employee, scott holmes, commerce, medicine, gown, delivery, bob walla, bryan, glove", "news_keywords": ", coronavirus, city of lincoln, lincoln-lancaster county health department, personal protective equipment, health-care, medical, local-government, employee, scott holmes, commerce, medicine, gown, delivery, bob walla, bryan, glove", "description": "The city of Lincoln tried to stock up on personal protection equipment last week, issuing a series of emergency bid requests seeking supplies to keep its employees safe.", "author": "PETER SALTER Lincoln Journal Star", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=441521217", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.columbustelegram.news", "googlebot": "noarchive", "google-site-verification": "4uxVHG_Ooii5jP_bSGAZQEUX9qZzQfiJKNNt6M5aFio", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://columbustelegram.com/news/local/city-of-lincoln-seeking-to-stock-up-on-sanitizer-masks/article_b84092cf-1c65-59b0-a846-b2b532ec4b06.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/columbustelegram.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/2b/c2b02baa-9087-5727-9833-fe6c4c5a3008/5e75101c4e2d6.image.jpg?crop=720%2C405%2C0%2C277&resize=720%2C405&order=crop%2Cresize", "width": 720, "height": 405}, "title": "City of Lincoln seeking to stock up on sanitizer, masks, gowns and gloves", "description": "The city of Lincoln tried to stock up on personal protection equipment last week, issuing a series of emergency bid requests seeking supplies to keep its employees safe.", "site_name": "Columbus Telegram", "section": "Local"}, "fb": {"app_id": 108624452519241, "pages": 177157036976}, "parsely-title": "City of Lincoln seeking to stock up on sanitizer, masks, gowns and gloves", "parsely-link": "https://columbustelegram.com/news/local/city-of-lincoln-seeking-to-stock-up-on-sanitizer-masks/article_b84092cf-1c65-59b0-a846-b2b532ec4b06.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-03-19T08:00:00-0500", "parsely-post-id": "b84092cf-1c65-59b0-a846-b2b532ec4b06", "parsely-image-url": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/columbustelegram.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/2b/c2b02baa-9087-5727-9833-fe6c4c5a3008/5e75101c4e2d6.image.jpg?crop=720%2C405%2C0%2C277&resize=720%2C405&order=crop%2Cresize", "parsely-author": "PETER SALTER Lincoln Journal Star", "parsely-section": "Local", "parsely-tags": ", coronavirus, city of lincoln, lincoln-lancaster county health department, personal protective equipment, health-care, medical, local-government, employee, scott holmes, commerce, medicine, gown, delivery, bob walla, bryan, glove"}, "canonical_link": "https://journalstar.com/news/local/city-of-lincoln-seeking-to-stock-up-on-sanitizer-masks/article_fb2a46af-50c1-5dc0-838d-2421b36d08ea.html"}
