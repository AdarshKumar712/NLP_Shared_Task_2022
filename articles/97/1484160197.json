Maybe! Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott both attended The Weeknd\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve bash on Tuesday, December 31. While the former flames were not pictured together throughout the night, it\u2019s likely they hung out at the lavish affair. The 22-year-old shared photos from her night out with her bestie Yris Palmer on her Instagram Stories while Travis, 27, uploaded a photo of himself with The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) on the \u2018gram. \u201cDudey bro\u2019s [sic],\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe KUWTK starlet, 22, was photographed at the singer\u2019s house in Beverly Hills wearing a black jacket and appeared to be with a bunch of people. However, the rapper was nowhere in sight. Even though the celebrity couple called it quits in October \u2014 a source told In Touch it wasn\u2019t \u201ca full-on split\u201d \u2014 it seems like there\u2019s still a lot of love between them. So much so, the Grammy nominee couldn\u2019t help but gush over the makeup mogul and their 20-month-old daughter, Stormi Webster.\n\nCourtesy of Travis Scott/Instagram\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been spending time with my family and with my daughter, Stormi,\u201d the \u201cSICKO MODE\u201d singer told XXL Magazine in an interview published on Monday, December 30. \u201cBeing a dad is better than what I thought it would be. Stormi is one of the best human beings I know. She\u2019s like my best friend. She makes life a little bit easier. She just inspires me, and she surprises me every day with how she\u2019s thinking. It\u2019s so crazy.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cHer mom and I came up with the name Stormi together. I love her mommy, and I always will. The hard part about relationships is just trying to be in one without a million outside voices interfering.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Kylie \u201cwants to have a good relationship\u201d with Travis \u201cfor the sake\u201d of their daughter, a second source told In Touch. \u201cShe would never want Stormi to feel that she\u2019s not supported by both of her parents.\u201d\n\nRecently, the TV personality even raved about her ex\u2019s new album, Jackboys, on social media. \u201cSTORMI\u2019S DAD,\u201d she captioned a screenshot of the new tunes after it was released on December 27. For his part, Travis seemingly responded to the brunette beauty\u2019s two new sexy snaps on Instagram. \u201cJust didn\u2019t feel right going into 2020 without one last thirst trap,\u201d she wrote on the \u2018gram. \u201cLOL,\u201d Travis replied on his Instagram Stories.\n\nMEGA\n\nNot only are fans rooting for the couple to get back together but so is the Kardashian family. \u201cEveryone is hoping that it\u2019s just temporary,\u201d a third insider explained.\n\nMaybe 2020 is the year #Kyvis makes their return.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Travis Scott", "New Year's Eve", "Kylie Jenner"], "authors": ["Jaclyn Roth"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 20:11:12 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Kylie Jenner and her baby daddy, Travis Scott, were both spotted at The Weeknd's New Year's Eve party on December 31 in Beverly Hills.
