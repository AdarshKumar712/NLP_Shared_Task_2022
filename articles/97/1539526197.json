(REUTERS) Last week, the Turkish president had severely criticised India for the communal clashes in Delhi and even went on to call them \u201cmassacres of Muslims\u201d. (REUTERS)\n\nDays after Turkish president criticised Delhi riots, India Thursday hit out at Recep Tayyip Erdogan saying his comments were \u201cfactually inaccurate\u201d and driven by \u201cpolitical agenda\u201d. External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, while addressing a press conference in the national capital Thursday, said India had made a strong demarche on the matter with the Turkish Ambassador in Delhi on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe do not expect such irresponsible statements from a Head of State,\u201d Kumar was quoted as saying by PTI.\n\nLast week, the Turkish president had severely criticised India for the communal clashes in Delhi and even went on to call them \u201cmassacres of Muslims\u201d.\n\nOn being asked UK\u2019s junior foreign minister Nigel Adams\u2019 comment on Delhi violence, Raveesh Kumar said the situation in the capital is fast returning to normal and that law enforcement agencies are doing their best to restore confidence and ensure that law and order is maintained.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister has appealed for peace and brotherhood. Senior officials have visited the place of violence, peace committees have been formed and other steps have been taken in this direction,\u201d he added.\n\nIn response to an urgent question on \u201cRecent Violence in India\u201d tabled by Pakistani-origin Opposition Labour Party MP Khalid Mahmood in the House of Commons on Tuesday, UK\u2019s Minister of State in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Nigel Adams had said, \u201cThe UK government also have concerns about the potential impact of the legislation (CAA).\u201d\n\nEarlier today, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei also said that the Indian government should confront extremist Hindus and stop the \u2018massacre\u2019 of Muslims.\n\n\u201cThe hearts of Muslims all over the world are grieving over the massacre of Muslims in India. The govt of India should confront extremist Hindus & their parties & stop the massacre of Muslims in order to prevent India\u2019s isolation from the world of Islam,\u201d Khamenei tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, the death toll in communal violence that broke out in northeast Delhi last month, which was sparked by protests over the amended Citizenship Act, climbed to 53 on Thursday. So far, GTB hospital has confirmed 44 deaths while three deaths have been confirmed at Lok Nayak hospital and five at RML and one at Jag Pravesh.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
