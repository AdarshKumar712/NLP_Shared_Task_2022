The attacks left about twenty-five militiamen dead and more than fifty wounded. The targets were KH storage facilities and command posts; Washington asserted that the command posts had masterminded a series of eleven rocket attacks that had culminated with the December 27 KH strike on the K-1 base.\n\nTehran did not waste much time responding to the American strike. One day later, led by its Iraqi puppets\u2014notably Iraqi National Security Advisor Faleh al Fayyad, and Hadi al Ameri, leader of the Shia Badr organization\u2014rioters charged the American embassy compound, used makeshift battering rams to break down its outer doors and ransacked the facility\u2019s entrance lobby.\n\nTrump responded by issuing what he called \u201cnot a warning but a threat\u201d that Tehran would be held accountable\u2014and presumably be the target of American military retaliation\u2014if American property were damaged or its citizens harmed. Tehran\u2019s response was to encourage a second day of rioting. When Washington deployed the 82nd airborne rapid response unit even as Marines were tear-gassing the rioters inside the embassy, the demonstrations abated, at least for the moment.\n\nIraqi military units did not intervene throughout the two days of riots. Though some officers evinced concern for the safety of the American diplomats, it was clear that the Iraqi government simply was unwilling, or fearful, of confronting Tehran\u2019s minions head-on. It was the most graphic evidence of what has long been recognized throughout the region, if not in Washington: It is Iran, not America, that calls the shots in Baghdad.\n\nThe man behind Tehran\u2019s strategy in Iraq, as he has been in Syria, is almost surely Major General Qasem Soleimani, commander of Iran\u2019s Quds force, Tehran\u2019s shock troops. Soleimani has had free reign in Iraq for some time. It is likely that the leaders of the Iranian-dominated militias, the Hashd al Shabi (Popular Mobilization Units)\u2014of which the KH is a component force\u2014answer to him. He surely wants Trump to respond with more than threats, or even tear gas.\n\nRead the original article.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Dov S.
