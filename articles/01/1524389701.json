(AP) \u2014 Pay raises are in the future for an Alabama town's council and mayor as long as they attend the council's monthly meetings.\n\nThe South Vinemont Town Council passed an ordinance to raise members' pay this November. The raise is the first for the council since February 2008, said Mayor Radginal Dodson.\n\nThe town\u2019s five council members previously received $300 per month with the mayor being paid $1,000 per month, The Cullman Times reported. The new ordinance keeps council members\u2019 pay at $300 per month but with an additional $100 per month if the members attend the council\u2019s meetings, and raises the mayor\u2019s pay to $1,400 per month with an additional $100 per month if he, too, attends the council\u2019s meetings, the newspaper reported.\n\nThe vice-mayor\u2019s pay would stay at $550 per month with the additional $100 per month if he attends the meetings, the newspaper said.\n\nThe changes will take effect after the town\u2019s municipal elections are held and new terms begin in November.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Associated Press", "Alabama", "Alabama News"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Feb 18 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "VINEMONT, Ala.
