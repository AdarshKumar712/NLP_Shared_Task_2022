For an estimate on how much you will receive, the Quebec government has set up a calculator tool.\n\nNo more sliding-scale daycare fees\n\nThe CAQ's promised return to a single-fee system for public daycare will be retroactive to the beginning of 2019.\n\nThe amount of money back will depend on the income of the parents. The rebate only applies to tax credits for subsidized daycares.\n\nIt will mean an average savings of $1,100 for 140,000 families.\n\nFamilies of children with disabilities who require special care will also receive an additional $652 per month.\n\nYou'll be paying less in school taxes\n\nThe CAQ government has committed to harmonizing school-tax rates across the province. The goal is to have a single rate by July 2021.\n\nBy then, homeowners across the province will be paying a tax rate that equals the lowest effective rate in the province from 2018-2019.\n\nThe savings will depend on where you live. For instance, the owner of a home valued at $270,000 in Montreal will save $179 a year by 2021, while an owner of a home of the same value in Saguenay\u2013Lac-Saint-Jean will save $500.\n\nMinimum wage going up\n\nQuebec's minimum wage will climb to $13.10 an hour on May 1 \u2014 an increase of 60 cents, Labour Minister Jean Boulet announced Wednesday.\n\nService industry workers who work for tips, such as bartenders and restaurant servers, will see their salaries rise by 40 cents per hour, to $10.45.\n\nThe CAQ campaigned on a promise to increase the minimum wage year over year, working toward $15 per hour by 2023.\n\nHydro-Qu\u00e9bec rebate\n\nHydro rates will be frozen as of April 1, 2020, and the increases for the four following years will be limited to the rate of inflation.\n\nYou will also receive money if you were a Hydro account holder in 2018 or 2019.\n\nResidential customers will receive an average of about $60, though the exact amount issued to each customer will be known in January.\n\nHospital parking capped\n\nStarting in the spring of 2020, hospital parking fees will be capped at around $7 to $10, depending on the region. The first two hours will be free.\n\nRight now, in some places parking fees cost more than $20.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cbc News"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Armed with a hefty surplus, the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec government offered up a number of goodies for the coming year.
