The $1,000 drop from $6,670 to $5,670 is sure to have shocked investors as it is slightly below analyst\u2019s price correction estimates but at the time of writing it appears that traders are buying into the dip.\n\nCrypto market daily performance. Source: Coin360\n\nThe price has bounced at $5,700 and currently bulls are pushing it back above $6,200. After this week\u2019s stellar 82.4% recovery from $3,775, Bitcoin was somewhat overdue for a pullback and as discussed in previous analysis the price was expected to retest underlying support at either $5,900, $5,500 or $5,380.\n\nBTC USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nDespite the $1,000 drop to $5,670, the RSI on the 4-hour timeframe remains in an uptrend, above the ascending trendline in bullish territory with a reading of 62.\n\nThe MACD has begun to curve down from the overbought region but the momentum on the histogram remains steady and buy volume is on par with the sell volume that preceded the pullback.\n\nIf bulls can reclaim the $6,400 level and close here that would be a victory for Bitcoin price.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nOver the next 4 to 6 hours, traders should keep an eye on trading volume on the shorter time frames and also watch to see if the RSI dips below the rising trendline on the 4-hour timeframe.\n\nThere is also a Dragonfly Doji candle on the 4-hour chart suggesting that even though bulls absorbed the selling by buying into the pullback there is still the possibility of a short-term trend reversal, as hinted by the MACD, RSI and ailing purchasing volume.\n\nBTC USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIn the event of a short-term trend reversal, traders will look for a bounce at the $5,450 support where a high volume node of the volume profile visible range resides. Ultimately, after a strong upsurge from the weekly low, Bitcoin needed to retest underlying support anyhow, hence the reason bulls have strongly bought into the current dip.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.
