threatened a demonstration of a \"new strategic weapon\" soon.\n\nWashington was swift to respond, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging Kim to \"take a different course\" and stressing that the United States wanted \"peace not confrontation\" with the North, while President Donald Trump played down the development, AFP reported.\n\nPyongyang has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland, and has carried out six nuclear tests, the last of them 16 times more powerful than the Hiroshima blast, according to the highest estimates.\n\nA self-imposed ban on such tests \u2013 Kim declared they were no longer needed \u2013 has been a centerpiece of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the past two years, which has seen three meetings between Kim and Trump, but little tangible progress.\n\nAny actual test is likely to anger Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kim's \"promise\" to him not to carry them out, and has downplayed launches of shorter-range weapons.\n\nNegotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February, and the North set the US an end-of-year deadline for it to offer fresh concessions on sanctions relief, or it would adopt a \"new way\".\n\n\"There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer,\" the official KCNA news agency cited Kim as telling top ruling party officials.\n\n\"The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,\" he added, referring to the North by its official name.\n\nThe full meeting of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party was an indication of a major policy shift.\n\nState television showed veteran newsreader Ri Chun Hee reading out the KCNA dispatch over footage of Kim addressing the officials and general imagery of the country.\n\nThe broadcast appeared to stand in place of Kim's usual New Year speech \u2013 normally a key moment in the North Korean political calendar.\n\nKim acknowledged the impact of international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its weapons programs, but made clear that the North was willing to pay the price to preserve its nuclear capability.\n\n\"The US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude,\" KCNA cited him as saying.\n\nWashington had \"conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop\" and sent high-tech military equipment to the South, he said.\n\nFor months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, while Washington has insisted it takes more tangible steps towards giving them up.\n\nThe US has already indicated that it will react if the North carries out a long-range missile test.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News and CBS after Kim's announcement, Pompeo said a resumption of nuclear and missile tests would be \"deeply disappointing\".\n\n\"We hope that Chairman Kim will take a different course... that he'll choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war,\" Pompeo said.\n\n\"We want peace, not confrontation,\" he added, with Seoul's Unification Ministry adding that a strategic weapon test \"would not help denuclearization negotiations\".\n\nTrump himself was emollient, saying that he thought Kim was \"a man of his word\" and that at their Singapore summit, \"We did sign a contract, talking about denuclearization\".\n\nAn ICBM launch would likely frustrate China, the North's key diplomatic backer and provider of trade and aid, which always stresses stability in a region it regards as its own backyard.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords":
