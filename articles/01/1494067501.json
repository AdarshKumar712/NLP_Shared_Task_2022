Acklin\u2019s wife, addressed Brannon while delivering her victim impact statement.\n\n\u201cMy anger towards you lasted a very long time,\u201d Josee Acklin said. \u201cOvernight I went from being a wife and a mom to working full time to missing two months of work to become my husband\u2019s nurse and caregiver.\u201d\n\nBrannon blamed his lengthy criminal history on drugs, alcohol and relationship troubles.\n\nHe said he was in a drug-induced state when he lit Jim Acklin on fire and that he was attempting to commit suicide during the incident.\n\nBrannon added he hoped an officer would shoot him.\n\n\u201cNo officer that night was meant to be hurt,\u201d Brannon said, \u201cMy plan was to remove myself from the pain and the embarrassment I was living in.\u201d\n\nJudge Becky Doherty was not phased by Brannon\u2019s emotional remarks.\n\n\u201cMr. Brannon, you\u2019re a coward,\u201d Doherty said, \u201cYou\u2019re a coward and I want you to look around this room and see bravery.\u201d\n\nShe noted Brannon\u2019s lengthy criminal history and told him he had multiple chances to clean up his act before critically injuring Acklin.\n\n\u201cSo standing here telling me this was a suicide attempt after you had just recently gone to a gas station, gone to Giant Eagle, had been running around that day without a care in the world until police showed up,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cI\u2019m not buying it.\u201d\n\nAcklin said he\u2019s looking forward to moving on with his life after suffering second and third-degree burns over more than 20% of his body.\n\n\u201cI was trying to think about what was going to be said,\u201d Acklin said, \u201cAnd you know, everything being brought back up again.\u201d\n\nBrannon will receive 333 days of time served that will be subtracted from his 16-year sentence.\n\nHe will also be required to register as an arson offender and a violent offender when he\u2019s released.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["aggravated
