The home team ended a run of five straight defeats with a commanding 107-run victory in the first test in Pretoria as the winds of change through their camp, on and off the pitch, brought immediate success. Coach Mark Boucher appears to have brought some steel back to the squad as they subdued an England side battling with illness and which has recently struggled to pick up wins on the road.\n\nSouth African opener Aiden Markram is definitely out with a finger injury and that should mean a debut for Pieter Malan, 30, at his home ground in what is an iconic test on the fixture list which could see as many as 10,000 England fans in attendance. South Africa must also decide whether to accommodate a fit-again Temba Bavuma in the middle-order, with his replacement Rassie van der Dussen scoring a second-innings half-century on debut in Pretoria. England have not won at Newlands since 1957, though their last two visits in 2010 and 2016 ended in draws.\n\nIt is a traditional stronghold for South Africa, who have lost only one of their previous 18 Tests at the venue, picking up 13 wins in that time. The illness that spread through the tourist\u2019s squad in the build-up to, and during, the first test appears to have eased, providing them with more options. Fit-again middle-order batsman Ollie Pope is likely to replace Jonny Bairstow in what should be the only change in the top seven, but the make-up of the bowling attack is far from certain. The wicket in Cape Town is expected to be less seamer-friendly than the first Test, which could mean the introduction of a specialist spin option, with Dominic Bess or Matt Parkinson in contention. Left-arm spinner Jack Leach still has a fitness question-mark hanging over him, which could mean Bess gets a run having not been part of the original touring party. The question would then be who to leave out, with one of the four-prong seam attack of James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Jofra Archer or Sam Curran to miss out.\n\nTough decisions: Anderson and Broad have 1053 Test wickets between them, but England coach Chris Silverwood concedes that their places will be up for discussion. \u201cIn Jimmy and Stu we have a wealth of experience and we\u2019d be really stupid not to take that into consideration every game,\u201d Silverwood told reporters after the first Test. \u201cBut, equally, you want your youngsters to come through and if we\u2019re going to make room for a spinner we\u2019ve got to have a look at which seamers are right for this pitch. \u201cIf there\u2019s a big decision we\u2019re not afraid to make it.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Sports"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 19:44:03 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A buoyant South Africa will seek to drive home their advantage at a favourite venue as they host an England side facing a big selection", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/wp-content/plugins/pwa-for-wp/images/logo.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A buoyant South Africa will seek to drive home their advantage at a favourite venue as they host an England side facing a big selection", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "South Africa seek to subdue England at favourite Newlands venue", "description": "A buoyant South Africa will seek to drive home their advantage at a favourite venue as they host an England side facing a big selection", "url": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/531117/south-africa-seek-to-subdue-england-at-favourite-newlands-venue/", "site_name": "Daily Times", "updated_time": "2020-01-01T19:44:05+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2020/01/01/South-Africa-seek-to-subdue-England-at-favourite-Newlands-venue.jpg", "secure_url": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2020/01/01/South-Africa-seek-to-subdue-England-at-favourite-Newlands-venue.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 450}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailytimespak", "section": "Sports", "published_time": "2020-01-01T19:44:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T19:44:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A buoyant South Africa will seek to drive home their advantage at a favourite venue as they host an England side facing a big selection", "title": "South Africa seek to subdue England at favourite Newlands venue", "site": "@dailytimespak", "image": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2020/01/01/South-Africa-seek-to-subdue-England-at-favourite-Newlands-venue.jpg", "creator": "@dailytimespak"}, "pwaforwp": "wordpress-plugin", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Times", "application-name": "Daily Times", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "generator": "AMP for WP 0.9.98", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/ms-icon-144x144.png", "google-site-verification": "OCRTS754JMxwghEzzchZDigcFsr1BA1g4gztRRYiCjs", "msvalidate.01": "7F7A94B66284996C319B6CD24FB6241E", "fb": {"pages": 710854355609434, "app_id": 330115364124091}}, "canonical_link": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/531117/south-africa-seek-to-subdue-england-at-favourite-newlands-venue/"}
