(Photo by Markus Schreiber / POOL / AFP) (Photo by MARKUS SCHREIBER/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) - MARKUS SCHREIBER/AFP\n\nAngela Merkel has been largely sidelined from discussions on ending the coronavirus lockdown in Germany after regional governments vowed to go their own way.\n\nSince the beginning of the crisis Mrs Merkel, the German chancellor, has worked to build a national consensus on tackling the virus.\n\nBut under Germany\u2019s federal constitution it is the 16 regional state governments who have the final say on lockdown measures, and this week they moved to reassert their control.\n\nThey effectively tore up a plan put forward by Mrs Merkel for gradual further loosening in June, instead announcing they would each implement their own measures.\n\n\u201cThe responsibility now lies with the regional prime ministers and district councils,\u201d Winfried Kretschmann, the regional leader of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, said. \u201cNo further discussions are planned with the chancellor.\u201d\n\nThere is still no sign of a second wave more than six weeks after Germany began loosening its lockdown, and many regional leaders have grown impatient with Mrs Merkel\u2019s cautious approach.\n\nAuthorities in the eastern state of Thuringia have gone so far as to suggest they could end lockdown completely when the current rules expire next week \u2014 though the regional government has since backtracked.\n\nMrs Merkel opened the way for this week\u2019s move when she chose not to hold her regular video conference with regional leaders.\n\nShe has used previous rounds of talks to persuade and cajole the state governments into signing up to a national lockdown regime.\n\nBut the discussions have been fraught and Mrs Merkel appears to have tired of the endless bickering, reportedly telling aides she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to put herself through that again\u201d.\n\nMandatory Credit: Photo by ANDREAS GORA/POOL/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock (10652504aj) Helge Braun, head of the Federal Chancellery, attends a Cabinet Meeting in Berlin, Germany, 20 May 2020.

Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg said it will allow public events for up to 100 people.\n\nIn the eastern state of Brandenburg, private parties of up to 50 people will be permitted provided social distancing is observed.\n\nGermany now faces a patchwork of different regional regulations, and there are already signs of discord between the state governments.\n\nBavaria threatened unspecified \u201cmeasures\u201d after the neighbouring state of Thuringia said it would consider ending all lockdown measures next week.\n\n\"Anyone who thinks corona is slowly disappearing is at best naive,\" Markus S\u00f6der, the Bavarian regional prime minister, said. \"Corona remains deadly.\"\n\nThe Thuringian authorities have since backtracked, suggesting social distancing and a facemask requirement on public transport and while shopping could remain in force.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Justin Huggler"], "publish_date": "Wed May 27 14:54:53 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Angela Merkel has been largely sidelined from discussions on ending the coronavirus lockdown in Germany after regional governments vowed to go their own way.
