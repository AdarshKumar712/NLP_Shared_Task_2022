Duties include: greeting clients, taking their orders, and filling grocery bags both for walk-in clients and for those who are homebound. Clerks also stock shelves, receive deliveries, break down bulk items, wash windows, sweep floors and pitch in for any task at hand.\n\nFOOD DRIVE VOLUNTEERS\n\nThis is a great opportunity for those who work during the week but want to help once a month for a few hours! Three times a month, on Saturdays, volunteers conduct food drives outside the doors of local markets. Food drive volunteers offer flyers to shoppers as they enter the door, asking them to buy extra items while they shop and then receive the donations in bins as the shoppers exit. View upcoming food drive dates.\n\nPICK-UP AND DELIVERY DRIVERS\n\nDeliver groceries to clients who are homebound due to illness or lack of transportation. Pick up groceries in Forestville in your own car. We provide maps and directions. Usually four to eight stops on a route. Volunteers report an average of two hours of time per route.\n\nGARDENERS\n\nUnder the direction of master gardeners, volunteers work to help maintain and harvest our organic vegetable, herb and flower gardens and orchard. The garden volunteers generally enjoy a lunch break together, often with fresh greens from the garden. A fine opportunity to learn more about organic gardening as well as touching the earth and connecting with nature.\n\nLOVING SPOONFUL\n\nVolunteers in the Loving Spoonful Program assist our chef to prep, prepare, and package healthy and delicious soups, salads, and other items for our clients.
