Minimum Wage Increase: For the first time in nearly a decade, Illinois is raising its minimum wage. It increases from $8.25 to $9.25 on January 1, and to $15 by Jan. 1, 2025.\n\n2. Legal Recreational Marijuana: On January 1, adults will be able to buy cannabis legally from a well-regulated market.\n\n3. Gratuity Not Included: Starting January 1, the law says all tips must go to the employee \u2013 not their employer.\n\n4. Defending DNA: Your genes are your business. Companies like Ancestry.com and 23andMe won\u2019t be able to share your ancestry test results with health or life insurance companies without consent.\n\n5. Safety First: Staring Jan. 1, 2020, you\u2019ll pay more for reckless driving. The maximum penalty for hitting a construction worker increases to $25,000. The fine for illegally passing a school bus doubles on January 1. Drivers who violate Scott\u2019s Law may be fined up to $10,000.\n\n6. Drop It and Drive: Illinois residents will no longer be able to watch streaming video while driving.\n\n7. Pet Project: Dog and cat kennels must be equipped with a fire sprinkler or alarm system if the kennel is not staffed at all times.\n\n8. You\u2019re In!: Starting in 2020, Illinois high schoolers in the top 10% of their class are guaranteed acceptance into NIU, EIU, SIU and WIU.\n\n9. Families First: Illinois police and firefighters risk their lives to keep us safe. That\u2019s why the burial benefit for a first responder killed in the line of duty doubles Jan. 1.\n\n10. Helping Heroes: Police will have access to better mental health resources in 2020 with training focused on wellness and suicide prevention.\n\nCheck out the full list here.\n\nMORE HEADLINES:\n\nFor more local news, download the MyStateline app (iOS) or (Android) and subscribe with Alexa.\n\n\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram!\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Hannah Zettl"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 18:39:18 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "ILLINOIS (WTVO) \u2014 Over 200 new laws are taking effect on January 1, 2020.
