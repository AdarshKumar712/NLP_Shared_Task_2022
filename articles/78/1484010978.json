Kennedy proposed in the 1960s catalysed new technology such as the MRI scanner and satellite dishes, the Earthshots aim to launch their own tidal wave of ambition and innovation.\n\nCrucially, the Earthshots aim to reward progress across all sectors of industry and society, not just technology. The Prize could be awarded to a wide range of individuals, teams or collaborations \u2013 scientists, activists, economists, leaders, governments, banks, businesses, cities, and countries \u2013 anyone who is making a substantial development or outstanding contribution to solving these environmental challenges.\n\nIn addition to a significant financial award, winners will receive large-scale public recognition for their work that will aim to inspire business and government collaboration and scaling.\n\nWith plans to formally launch the project later this year, intense work is already underway on this multi-million pound project.\n\nThe Earthshot challenges will be announced in special events around the globe and an annual awards ceremony will take place in different cities across the world each year between 2021 and 2030.\n\nPrince William said: \u201cThe earth is at a tipping point and we face a stark choice: either we continue as we are and irreparably damage our planet or we remember our unique power as human beings and our continual ability to lead, innovate and problem-solve. Remember the awe inspiring civilisations that we have built, the life-saving technology we have created, the fact that we have put a man on the moon. People can achieve great things. The next ten years present us with one of our greatest tests \u2013 a decade of action to repair the Earth.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Barbados Today"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cropped-logo-150x150.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1386333611", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.luovalabs.barbadostodaymobile", "google-site-verification": "tv6HaZJva6u6f8lwfpLqmQ5hBqYUg7fqvhonjYsxXzo", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Prince William announces most prestigious environmental prize in history - Barbados Today", "description": "Prince William is kick-starting 2020 with a new drive to dispel the current pessimism around the environment, and replace it with fresh optimism and action.
