Cathy O’Neil’s bestselling 2016 book, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/27/cathy-oneil-weapons-of-math-destruction-algorithms-big-data" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/27/cathy-oneil-weapons-of-math-destruction-algorithms-big-data" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Weapons of Math Destruction</em></a>, describes how biases in algorithms used in hiring or evaluation can cost people jobs, and how opaque and possibly illegal criteria may lead an automated risk-assessment system to unfairly deny some people access to bank loans.</p><p name="7382" id="7382" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet U.S. law has significant shortcomings when it comes to discrimination, because it tends to focus on individual “bad actors” that act in discriminatory ways while failing to account for the structural conditions that maintain inequalities. The law is also only equipped to handle discriminatory acts <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">after</em> they’ve occurred, rather than intervening in proactive or progressive ways.</p><p name="12d5" id="12d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And in the real world, discrimination is more often the result, not the cause of stubborn stereotypes and pernicious social biases that permeate everything, underwriting our senses of self and others. Lost opportunities — that job or that bank loan — are the end result of larger social and cultural processes that U.S. anti-discrimination law isn’t really designed to address or prevent.</p></div></div></section><section name="5603" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="4c5e" id="4c5e" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">This Is What Institutional Prejudice Looks Like in the Digital Age</h3><p name="bd6a" id="bd6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">At the turn of the millennium, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration deployed an automated system to detect fraud in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a federal aid program that provides food-buying assistance to people on low incomes. In 2002, that algorithm inadvertently <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020410&amp;slug=somalis10m" data-href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020410&amp;slug=somalis10m" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">banned multiple Somali markets</a> from accepting benefits.</p><p name="7032" id="7032" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The system apparently had not been designed to culturally accommodate the food-buying patterns of this particular immigrant community. It flagged consecutive bulk purchases as fraudulent, rather than acknowledging the local practice of negotiating bulk orders of things like rice and meat in advance, and then sharing rides to the store with other families to pick up the prepaid orders.</p><p name="f656" id="f656" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the shop owners, struggling to keep his market open as a result of this seemingly faceless decision, remarked at the time, “People keep coming in here and saying, ‘What should I do now?’”</p><p name="86b8" id="86b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Beyond the obvious harm of some Somali communities being denied access to their local food markets, the ban also reinforced harmful cultural stereotypes about immigrants, the welfare system, and fraud. It did so whether the system or its designers meant to or not.</p><p name="565d" id="565d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The term “cultural violence” was first developed by the veteran sociologist Johan Galtung. “Cultural violence makes direct and structural violence look, even feel, right — at least not wrong,” he wrote in 1990.</p><p name="fa99" id="fa99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Neither distributional nor representative forms of harm can survive without a cultural backdrop that enables them. Pernicious racist or ethnocentric ideas — that entire countries or regions are “shitholes,” for example — perpetuate violence by justifying extant inequalities, supporting destructive policy or rationalizing physical harm.</p><p name="aa59" id="aa59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And that is the crime we commit when, as researchers and engineers and data scientists, we fail to think not only about the consequences of our work, but also our assumptions, our categories, and our position relative to the subjects of the data we work with.</p></div></div></section><section name="55b7" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="c0fd" id="c0fd" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Reinforcing Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric</h3><p name="275a" id="275a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Less than a month before that Harvard computer scientist awkwardly defended his work on an automated gang crime system, President Donald Trump delivered his first State of the Union address.</p><p name="f847" id="f847" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During the address, Trump fixated, as he had done many times during his campaign, on “gang crimes” committed by MS-13, a youth gang that operates in the United States and Central America. He asked Congress to “close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country.”</p><p name="7a47" id="7a47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But while MS-13 is a significant problem in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, the group’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/01/31/trump-is-wrong-about-ms-13-and-his-rhetoric-will-make-it-worse/" data-href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/01/31/trump-is-wrong-about-ms-13-and-his-rhetoric-will-make-it-worse/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">U.S. presence is small</a>, and it isn’t clear that its U.S.-based members are <a href="https://nacla.org/news/2017/10/06/distorting-ms-13-threat" data-href="https://nacla.org/news/2017/10/06/distorting-ms-13-threat" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">primarily immigrants</a>.</p><p name="6a33" id="6a33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Trump has repeatedly used the group to incite fear among his audience, exploiting a small number of gruesome crimes to drum up support for his sweeping anti-immigration policies. These policies have already produced chaotic travel bans, led to increased raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, and left DREAMers in legislative limbo.</p><p name="1a0a" id="1a0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By comparison, the 2020 U.S. decennial census seems far less sensational and an unlikely target for anti-immigrant sentiment.</p><p name="64e2" id="64e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A vital tool for government and democracy, the census determines how seats in the House of Representatives are distributed and how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds will be allocated to key public services.</p><p name="8feb" id="8feb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet the census has always been a lightning rod for political interests, wrote the distinguished history professor Margo Anderson in her 1988 book, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The American Census</em>. “Issues of race and region, growth and decline, equity and justice, have been fought out in census politics over the centuries.”</p><p name="4ed4" id="4ed4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The 2020 census is no exception. In late 2017, Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department wrote to the Census Bureau pushing for an additional <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-justice-department-pushes-for-citizenship-question-on-census-alarming-experts" data-href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-justice-department-pushes-for-citizenship-question-on-census-alarming-experts" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">question regarding citizenship</a>, claiming it wants to aid in the enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. Numerous stakeholders, from civil rights groups to state attorneys general, have decried the request, rightfully pointing out that a citizenship question is likely to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/census-rushes-to-respond-to-request-to-add-citizenship-question" data-href="https://www.propublica.org/article/census-rushes-to-respond-to-request-to-add-citizenship-question" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">depress response rates among Latinx</a> and other groups — especially given the current administration’s rhetoric and policies.</p><p name="69f3" id="69f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Despite the pushback — and despite the fact that adding a question to a survey instrument without thoroughly studying its possible impact is just plain bad science — Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/wilbur-ross-overruled-career-officials-at-census-bureau-to-add-citizenship-question" data-href="https://www.propublica.org/article/wilbur-ross-overruled-career-officials-at-census-bureau-to-add-citizenship-question" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">overruled Census Bureau officials</a> in late March and confirmed that the citizenship question will be added. As a result, stakeholders fear the 2020 census will have fewer responses and therefore less representation from an already politically vulnerable group.</p><p name="f2a1" id="f2a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And this was the backdrop against which the Harvard researchers chose to present their work: fearmongering rhetoric, anti-immigrant policy, and increased targeting of marginalized communities by immigration and law enforcement. Through their choice of data, and framing the question in the way they did, they inadvertently lent support to the kind of harmful, anti-immigrant representations already damaging Latinx communities across the country.</p><blockquote name="4e82" id="4e82" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Those choices are built on assumptions and prejudices about people, intimately weaving them into processes and results that reinforce biases and, worse, make them seem natural or given.</blockquote><p name="2b35" id="2b35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing">They might not actively endorse the current administration’s policies personally, but they’ve still made those ideas feel, as Galtung put it, “not wrong.”</p></div></div></section><section name="56e7" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="fe80" id="fe80" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">How We Can Fix This</h3><p name="faf1" id="faf1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Where should we start repairing these systems and the culture that produces them?</p><p name="c878" id="c878" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As scholar Virginia Eubanks, author of the book <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/automatinginequality/virginiaeubanks/9781250074317/" data-href="https://us.macmillan.com/automatinginequality/virginiaeubanks/9781250074317/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Automating Inequality</em></a>, <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2018/01/the-digital-poorhouse/" data-href="https://harpers.org/archive/2018/01/the-digital-poorhouse/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">captures it</a>, “If there is to be an alternative, we must build it purposefully, brick by brick and byte by byte.”</p><p name="5ec6" id="5ec6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some researchers and technologists are understandably calling for more holistic thinking about the kinds of systems and tools that are being built. The academic Kate Crawford, who specializes in the social impact of data systems, asks audiences, “What kind of world do we want to live in?” Princeton computer scientist Arvind Narayanan argues, “It’s not enough to ask if code executes correctly. We also need to ask if it makes society better or worse.”</p><blockquote name="2e94" id="2e94" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Neither distributional nor representative forms of harm can survive without a cultural backdrop that enables them.</blockquote><p name="74de" id="74de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">The sentiment is a good one — we should certainly work to make the world better for lots of people and not just a few. But this kind of call to action risks hollowness if it doesn’t focus on those people being hurt by discriminatory systems. As author Mandy Henk <a href="https://twitter.com/mandyhenk/status/966438578577326080" data-href="https://twitter.com/mandyhenk/status/966438578577326080" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">noted</a>, our subjects aren’t some amorphous “they.” Instead, our discussions need to be grounded in the political and cultural contexts that make these people vulnerable or marginalized in the first place.</p><p name="2019" id="2019" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Others have suggested that both the collection of data and the design of data-driven systems must become more transparent, which will help ensure that everything is fair and representative. There are certainly cases where <a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/90165544/why-designing-ai-should-be-more-like-building-hardware" data-href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/90165544/why-designing-ai-should-be-more-like-building-hardware" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">datasheets for AI</a> or <a href="https://acm-fca.org/2018/03/29/negativeimpacts/" data-href="https://acm-fca.org/2018/03/29/negativeimpacts/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">more robust peer review</a> might be a good idea, but imagining ethical paths forward for research, big data, and algorithms means going beyond technocratic solutions. We have to work much harder to exercise patience, empathy, and humility in how we conceive of the lives and experiences of our data subjects.</p><p name="daf7" id="daf7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To begin, engineers and data scientists are far more likely to create balanced and representational products if they themselves are from a diverse range of backgrounds. “If we don’t have diversity in our set of researchers, we are not going to address problems that are faced by the majority of people in the world,” said Microsoft research scientist <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610192/were-in-a-diversity-crisis-black-in-ais-founder-on-whats-poisoning-the-algorithms-in-our/?ref=InventNewsletterMar1418&amp;utm_source=invent-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-mgb&amp;utm_campaign=invent-031418&amp;utm_content=link" data-href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610192/were-in-a-diversity-crisis-black-in-ais-founder-on-whats-poisoning-the-algorithms-in-our/?ref=InventNewsletterMar1418&amp;utm_source=invent-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-mgb&amp;utm_campaign=invent-031418&amp;utm_content=link" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Timnit Gebru</a>. “When problems don’t affect us, we don’t think they’re that important, and we might not even know what these problems are because we’re not interacting with the people who are experiencing them.”</p><p name="1c5f" id="1c5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Engaging with <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/04/hey-computer-scientists-stop-hating-humanities/" data-href="https://www.wired.com/2017/04/hey-computer-scientists-stop-hating-humanities/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">humanities and social science</a> projects can also help.
