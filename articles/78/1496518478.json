The hurdles and barriers for me are when I\u2019m trying to do my work and people want to talk about him.\n\nCressida is aware she\u2019ll probably always be asked about her ex (Picture: Jenny Brough/ES Magazine)\n\nCressida wants to be known for her acting (Picture: Jenny Brough/ES Magazine)\n\n\u2018I work very hard and love what I do\u2014I just want to continue. But it is still something I have to contend with. It is what it is. People will perhaps always ask me about it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCressida was introduced to Harry by Princess Eugenie, and they dated from 2012 until 2014.\n\nNow, Bonas is preparing to marry Harry Wentworth-Stanley after announcing their engagement last May \u2013 the same month that her ex Harry tied the knot with Meghan Markle, with Cressida attending the wedding.\n\nAnd Cressida refused to \u2018take a position\u2019 on Meghan \u2018out of respect\u2019 for Harry and the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nThe actress said: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t take a position on that because it would be a headline. I want to talk about my work. And also out of respect.\n\nCressida attended Harry and Meghan\u2019s wedding (Picture: IAN WEST/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe full interview is in the new issue of ES Magazine\n\n\u2018What\u2019s the expression? How would I feel if the shoe was on the other foot and it was an ex talking about me?\n\n\u2018It feels like a long time ago, so when it comes up it feels strange because I\u2019m in a very different place now \u2014 I\u2019m getting married, I\u2019ve learned a lot.\u2019\n\nCressida has been receiving rave reviews for her performance in White House Farm, which is based on the infamous White House Farm murders in 1985.\n\nSheila, who suffered from mental health issues, was framed for killing her mother, father and two young sons before allegedly taking her own life.\n\nCressida wouldn\u2019t take a position on Meghan (Picture: BEN STANSALL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCressida stars as Sheila Caffell in White House Farm (Picture: ITV)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, her brother Jeremy Bamber was found guilty of the murders and was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nPreviously, Cressida admitted she felt a \u2018huge responsibility\u2019 going into the role, telling the Mirror: \u2018I wanted to make it as honest as I could. Looking at how mental health was treated then, it\u2019s so different tot now. The way she was labelled I thought was so shocking. She was a very vulnerable person.\u2019\n\nThe full interview appears in this week\u2019s issue of ES Magazine, Thursday 16 January 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
