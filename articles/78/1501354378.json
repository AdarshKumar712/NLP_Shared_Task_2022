These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These include, without limitation, risks that: the company and Cloud Sherpas will not be able to close the transaction in the time period anticipated, or at all, which is dependent on the parties\u2019 ability to satisfy certain closing conditions; the transaction might not achieve the anticipated benefits for the company; the company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on the company\u2019s clients\u2019 businesses and levels of business activity; the company\u2019s business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for the company\u2019s services and solutions, and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect the company\u2019s results of operations; if the company is unable to keep its supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, the company\u2019s business, the utilization rate of the company\u2019s professionals and the company\u2019s results of operations may be materially adversely affected; the markets in which the company competes are highly competitive, and the company might not be able to compete effectively; the company could have liability or the company\u2019s reputation could be damaged if the company fails to protect client and/or company data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if the company\u2019s information systems are breached; the company\u2019s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if the company cannot adapt and expand its services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants; the company\u2019s results of operations could materially suffer if the company is not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable it to meet its profitability expectations; if the company does not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing its work or if the third parties upon whom it relies do not meet their commitments, then the company\u2019s contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable; the company\u2019s results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the company\u2019s profitability could suffer if its cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and the company may not be able to improve its profitability through improvements to cost-management to the degree it has done in the past; the company\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected if the company incurs legal liability; the company\u2019s work with government clients exposes the company to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment; the company might not be successful at identifying, acquiring or integrating businesses or entering into joint ventures; the company\u2019s Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose it to operational risks; changes in the company\u2019s level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in the company\u2019s treatment as an Irish company, could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition; as a result of the company\u2019s geographically diverse operations and its growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, the company is more susceptible to certain risks; adverse changes to the company\u2019s relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of its key alliance partners could adversely affect the company\u2019s results of operations; the company\u2019s services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or the company might lose its ability to utilize the intellectual property of others; if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, its business could be adversely affected; the company\u2019s ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on its reputation in the marketplace; many of the company\u2019s contracts include payments that link some of its fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require the company to meet specific service levels, which could increase the variability of the company\u2019s revenues and impact its margins; if the company is unable to collect its receivables or unbilled services, the company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected; if the company is unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with its size, the company might be unable to achieve its business objectives; the company\u2019s share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict; the company\u2019s results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain effective internal controls; any changes to the estimates and assumptions that the company makes in connection with the preparation of its consolidated financial statements could adversely affect its financial results; the company may be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to its incorporation in Ireland;
