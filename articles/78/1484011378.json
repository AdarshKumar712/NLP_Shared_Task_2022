Long anticipated by the sort of runner who devotes his free time to scouring Facebook groups, Instagram pages, and online message boards for news about foams, colorways, heel-toe offsets, and inventory restocks (and who is willing to part with hundreds of dollars to gain a competitive edge), the Next%, which was unveiled this week, is the successor to Nike's Vaporfly 4%\u2014a shoe the company claims can make runners four percent more efficient on their feet, translating to precious minutes over the course of a race like the marathon. Since their debut in 2017, Vaporflys have become a race-day favorite among professional athletes and hobby joggers alike. (Observe the sea of red Vaporflys among the elite field at last year's London Marathon.) They have so far avoided being banned from competitive events by the International Association of Athletics Federations, the governing body of the running world. But the Next% could change that: Nike claims the shoe saves runners even more energy than its predecessors. This week, I confirmed those claims with the researchers who performed external validation of Nike's internal tests: The shoes, they say, provided a significant advantage over the 4%s in a controlled study. The new Vaporfly's superior energy-savings could translate to even faster times. But how much of an advantage will the Next%s actually provide\u2014and will it be enough to compel the IAAF to act?\n\nThe story so far goes like this: In 2016, Nike unveiled the first version of the Vaporfly, appending \"4%\" to the name in reference to the energy savings they were purported to provide. The shoes represented the technological component of a three-year, multi-pronged effort to engineer a perfect marathon and break the 26.2-mile race's elusive two-hour barrier at a race track in Monza, Italy. Eliud Kipchoge, widely regarded as the greatest marathoner of all time, headlined the attempt. He came just 25 seconds short\u2014closer than most people thought he would. Granted, the conditions of the race were optimized for speed\u2014Kipchoge had a phalanx of pacers blocking the wind for the majority of the race, and he ran on a loop with zero time-sapping 90-degree turns\u2014so it didn't count as an official record. What's more, it was far from clear that the shoes were the key to Kipchoge's brush with the two-hour barrier. Yet he and many other runners, professional and otherwise, have worn some version of the shoes in each of their races since. After Monza, Vaporflys quickly became a controversial talking point among the running set. Do they really make you faster, or are they part of a carefully orchestrated marketing stunt? Are they designed for elite runners, or can casual competitors benefit from them, as well? The answer to all these questions appears to be yes. Peer-reviewed research has confirmed that the shoes make runners more efficient. WIRED's in-house analysis found that runners of the 2017 New York Marathon finished faster if they were wearing Vaporflys. Last year, the New York Times analyzed nearly half a million marathon and half-marathon times logged between 2014 and 2018, and found that, even after accounting for confounding variables, runners shod in Vaporflys ran between 3 and 4 percent faster than similar runners wearing other shoes. As for the marketing bit: The $250 shoes sold so well that, for months, the only reliable way to land a pair was to buy them at a premium on the secondary shoe market. So firmly has the Vaporfly effect anchored itself in the running community's consciousness that last year, when the Boston Marathon subtracted five minutes from the times that athletes must run to qualify for the race, conspiratorially minded runners speculated that all the Vaporflys had something to do with it. As for Kipchoge, he managed to clinch an official record a year after his unofficial attempt in Monza. At the 2018 Berlin Marathon, he traversed the course's 26.2 miles in 2:01:39. It was a precedent-shattering performance. For more than half a century, improvements to the marathon world record had come in increments measured in seconds. Kipchoge crushed the previous record by a colossal one minute and 18 seconds. And he did it wearing Vaporflys.\n\nThe question you're probably wondering: How do these shoes work? \"Our research suggests that the energy savings of the first Vaporfly came from two things, the foam in the midsole and the carbon fiber plate sandwiched inside,\" says Wouter Hoogkamer, a biomechanist in the Locomotion Laboratory at the University of Colorado Boulder. An expert in the energetics of running, Hoogkamer was the first author on the peer-reviewed study Nike used to claim the OG Vaporfly could improve running economy by four percent. What that study couldn't tell him and his colleagues was where the energy savings came from. So they designed a followup study to begin teasing apart where those precious percentage points originate. Nike Their results showed that the foam in the midsole (Nike calls it ZoomX, but foam nerds know it as Pebax) is uncommonly compliant and resilient. Translation: It's squishy and springy, respectively. Those properties enable the foam to absorb the energy a runner applies when their feet meet pavement and return a portion of it to their stride\u2026 somehow. How it works, exactly, remains unclear. The researchers originally hypothesized the foam would save runners energy by reducing bending at their knees, but that turned out not to be the case. \"But the foam, mechanically speaking, is a big player in whatever's going on,\" Hoogkamer says. Their results also showed that the carbon fiber plate plays a role\u2014but not in the way many people think. When the Vaporfly was first unveiled, critics of the shoe speculated that the plate acted like a spring. But Hoogkamer's findings suggest the plate's spring function is negligible. What the plate does do is improves runners' ankle mechanics by stabilizing the joint and reducing the load on the calves. At the same time, its stiffness helps keep runners' toes nice and straight, allowing them to preserve the energy they would otherwise spend flexing them. If keeping your toes straight sounds to you like it would provide pretty meager energy benefits, Hoogkamer agrees. \"Physiologically speaking, I have a hard time believing that eliminating toe flexion saves you much,\" he says. \"My current thinking is that the foam and plate are working in concert, but that the foam is doing more work than the plate.\" And reader, you won't believe this, but the Next%'s midsole contains 15 percent more foam than its predecessor.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Sports", "running", "marathon", "Nike Two Hour Marathon", "running shoes", "shoes"], "tags": ["#Nike Two Hour Marathon", "#Sports", "#shoes", "#marathon", "#running", "#running shoes"], "authors": ["Robbie Gonzalez", "Jonathan Lambert", "Adam Rogers", "Emily Dreyfuss", "Matt Simon", "Arielle Pardes", "Douglas Preston", "Wired Staff", "Mara Hvistendahl"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "At Sunday's London Marathon, Eliud Kipchoge will wear the ZoomX Vaporfly Next%, the latest installment in Nike's performance-boosting Vaporfly line of shoes.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "content-type": "article", "theme-color": "#000000", "id": "5cc320bec6a1822e416ba408", "keywords": "Sports,running,marathon,Nike Two Hour Marathon,running shoes,shoes", "news_keywords": "science,Sports,running,marathon,Nike Two Hour Marathon,running shoes,shoes", "description": "At Sunday's London Marathon, Eliud Kipchoge will wear the ZoomX Vaporfly Next%, the latest installment in Nike's performance-boosting Vaporfly line of shoes.", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The Science Behind Nike's New, Even Faster Marathon Shoe", "description": "At Sunday's London Marathon, Eliud Kipchoge will wear the ZoomX Vaporfly Next%, the latest installment in Nike's performance-boosting Vaporfly line of shoes.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.wired.com/photos/5cc3a3e166ece94420b10a7b/191:100/pass/Nike-ZoomX-Vaporfly-NEXTpercent.jpg", "width": 1528, "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-science-behind-nikes-new-vaporfly-next-marathon-shoe/", "site_name": "WIRED"}, "fb": {"page_id": 19440638720}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Science Behind Nike's New, Even Faster Marathon Shoe", "description": "At Sunday's London Marathon, Eliud Kipchoge will wear the ZoomX Vaporfly Next%, the latest installment in Nike's performance-boosting Vaporfly line of shoes.", "image": {"src": "https://media.wired.com/photos/5cc3a3e166ece94420b10a7b/2:1/w_2500,c_limit/Nike-ZoomX-Vaporfly-NEXTpercent.jpg"}, "site": "@wired", "domain": "WIRED", "creator": "@wired"}, "parsely-title": "The Science Behind Nike's New ZoomX Vaporfly Next% Marathon Shoe", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-post-id": "5cc320bec6a1822e416ba408", "parsely-image-url": "https://media.wired.com/photos/5cc3a3e166ece94420b10a7b/master/pass/Nike-ZoomX-Vaporfly-NEXTpercent.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2019-04-27T13:00:00.000Z", "parsely-section": "science", "parsely-author": "Robbie Gonzalez", "parsely-tags": "Sports,running,marathon,Nike Two Hour Marathon,running shoes,shoes,default,top-image,related-video", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"At Sunday's London Marathon, Eliud Kipchoge will wear the ZoomX Vaporfly Next%, the latest installment in Nike's performance-boosting Vaporfly line of shoes.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.wired.com/photos/5cc3a3e166ece94420b10a7b/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Nike-ZoomX-Vaporfly-NEXTpercent.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.wired.com/photos/5cc3a3e166ece94420b10a7b/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Nike-ZoomX-Vaporfly-NEXTpercent.jpg\"}"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-science-behind-nikes-new-vaporfly-next-marathon-shoe/"}
