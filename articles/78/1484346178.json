The academic Kate Crawford, who specializes in the social impact of data systems, asks audiences, \u201cWhat kind of world do we want to live in?\u201d Princeton computer scientist Arvind Narayanan argues, \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to ask if code executes correctly. We also need to ask if it makes society better or worse.\u201d\n\nNeither distributional nor representative forms of harm can survive without a cultural backdrop that enables them.\n\nThe sentiment is a good one \u2014 we should certainly work to make the world better for lots of people and not just a few. But this kind of call to action risks hollowness if it doesn\u2019t focus on those people being hurt by discriminatory systems. As author Mandy Henk noted, our subjects aren\u2019t some amorphous \u201cthey.\u201d Instead, our discussions need to be grounded in the political and cultural contexts that make these people vulnerable or marginalized in the first place.\n\nOthers have suggested that both the collection of data and the design of data-driven systems must become more transparent, which will help ensure that everything is fair and representative. There are certainly cases where datasheets for AI or more robust peer review might be a good idea, but imagining ethical paths forward for research, big data, and algorithms means going beyond technocratic solutions. We have to work much harder to exercise patience, empathy, and humility in how we conceive of the lives and experiences of our data subjects.\n\nTo begin, engineers and data scientists are far more likely to create balanced and representational products if they themselves are from a diverse range of backgrounds. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have diversity in our set of researchers, we are not going to address problems that are faced by the majority of people in the world,\u201d said Microsoft research scientist Timnit Gebru. \u201cWhen problems don\u2019t affect us, we don\u2019t think they\u2019re that important, and we might not even know what these problems are because we\u2019re not interacting with the people who are experiencing them.\u201d\n\nEngaging with humanities and social science projects can also help. To that end, it is welcome news that the Social Science Research Council recently announced that it\u2019s partnering with Facebook to give independent researchers access to the company\u2019s data. It\u2019s a potentially huge step toward gaining a better understanding of how data-intensive social platforms like Facebook shape our world \u2014 and the lives of people in it.\n\nYet engaging other kinds of research isn\u2019t enough. Social scientists have had their own share of high-profile controversies, from failing to secure the privacy of research subjects to experimenting with people\u2019s emotions without their consent. But many others have succeeded in meaningfully focusing on the lives and experiences of their subjects, from indigenous and border communities\u2019 use of fitness trackers and the impact of data collection on marginalized groups in major U.S. cities to online privacy and intimate partner abuse. Our engagement, then, must be well-considered and put the needs and vulnerabilities of specific groups first.\n\nIt is important to ask who might be damaged by a certain set of assumptions and a certain algorithmic solution. We should also ask: Who does this protect? Who cannot be a target of this set of data? I am shielding someone \u2014 what does that say about my system?\n\nMost important, engineers and data scientists need to listen to and engage with affected communities.\n\nThey should understand the struggles and histories of vulnerable communities and be ready to challenge their own assumptions.\n\nThey should offer support and resources \u2014 not opinions.\n\nThey should support legislation, causes, and organizations that improve lives without making them increasingly dependent on data-intensive systems of tracking and control.\n\nThey should not draw on the lives and experiences of their subjects without contributing something in return.\n\nUltimately, we need empathy and thoughtfulness in the design of algorithms and data science if we are to change the damaging cultural narratives that reinforce injustice and inequality for vulnerable people.\n\nBecause it\u2019s never \u201cjust\u201d an algorithm. And there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cjust\u201d an engineer.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Anna Lauren Hoffmann"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "It\u2019s February 2018, and a small group of Harvard researchers are standing on a stage in New Orleans unveiling a system that automates the detection of so-called gang crimes.
