The market may turn much more optimistic about China's growth prospects, similar to early 2019, but we recommend caution on the economic impact of the RRR cut,\" he wrote.\n\nCooling domestic demand and a bruising trade war with the United States have contributed to the economic slowdown.\n\nWashington and Beijing last month announced a \"Phase One\" trade deal, de-escalating their nearly two-year trade war as President Donald Trump reduced or cancelled some tariffs while Beijing promised to adopt trade reforms and buy more US farm exports.\n\nThe partial trade agreement will be signed in the middle of January, Trump said Tuesday, announcing that he will also travel to China for continued talks.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["China", "Economy"], "authors": ["Afp .
