It wouldn\u2019t last very long,\u201d he bluntly said when asked by reporters about a potential war with Iran.\n\nThe remarks were made only hours after Iranian-backed militiamen stormed the U.S. Embassy in Iraq\u2019s capital of Baghdad and nearly triggered another Benghazi.\n\nDuring a roughly 10-minute-long presser before the new year began, he also addressed his predictions for the U.S. economy, as well as his thoughts on North Korea\u2019s recent antics and the Democrats\u2019 flailing impeachment drive.\n\nListen:\n\nThe rest of the evening was far less somber at Mar-a-Lago\u2019s annual black-tie New Year\u2019s Eve gala, which Politico notes is \u201ca $1,000-a-head event that starts with cocktails by the main pool before moving to a decadent dinner in the estate\u2019s massive ballroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the past, the shindig has attracted celebrities like Sylvester Stallone, Woody Allen, Rod Stewart, Serena Williams, Martha Stewart and Robert Kraft.\u201d\n\nThis year noted guests included \u2026\n\nThe president\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani, who held his own mini-press conference of sorts.\n\nRudy Giuliani pictured at Mar-a-Lago this NYE. pic.twitter.com/CcAdlYqYtW \u2014 Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) January 1, 2020\n\nWatch:\n\nHousing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs and notably pro-life My Pillow founder Michael Lindell:\n\nGuests include Ben Carson, Lou Dobbs and the My Pillow guy. pic.twitter.com/Bbr2N4FU95 \u2014 Josh Wingrove (@josh_wingrove) January 1, 2020\n\nThe president\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner:\n\nThe president\u2019s son Eric and his wife, Lara:\n\nEric and Lara Trump. pic.twitter.com/xWYpuoGVS7 \u2014 Josh Wingrove (@josh_wingrove) January 1, 2020\n\nThe president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and his girlfriend, former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle:\n\nThe president\u2019s other daughter, Tiffany Trump, and her boyfriend, Michael Boulos:\n\nTurning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk:\n\nConservative radio show host Howie Carr:\n\nHappy New Year from Mar a Lago! #KAG pic.twitter.com/gmE6ckF5Rt \u2014 Howie Carr (@HowieCarrShow) January 1, 2020\n\nWhite House principal deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley:\n\nThe president\u2019s youngest son, Barron:\n\nOh man, Barron Trump.

He said he hopes Kim Jong Un\u2019s Christmas gift to him is a beautiful vase; he said a partial vaping flavor ban is coming soon (but expressed hope the flavors will be deemed safe and put back on the market soon); he said the China deal likely only needs two phases. pic.twitter.com/5HJ3PkRUPF \u2014 Josh Wingrove (@josh_wingrove) January 1, 2020\n\nThe president reportedly began the day driving to the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach but quickly switched plans and left only 49 minutes after his arrival.\n\nThough he received some criticism from the left over the perceived Obama-like optics of showing up at the resort, he himself took to Twitter later to dispute media reports that he\u2019d actually gone on to play golf; and to note the difference between the Baghdad attack and Obama\u2019s infamous Benghazi attack: His decision to take quick, immediate action.\n\nUnlike other people \u2026\n\nLook:\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Iraq is, & has been for hours, SAFE! Many of our great Warfighters, together with the most lethal military equipment in the world, was immediately rushed to the site. Thank you to the President & Prime Minister of Iraq for their rapid response upon request\u2026. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2019\n\n\u2026.Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2019\n\nThe Fake News said I played golf today, and I did NOT! I had meeting in various locations, while closely monitoring the U.S. Embassy situation in Iraq, which I am still doing. The Corrupt Lamestream Media knew this but, not surprisingly, failed to report or correct! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2019\n\nHours later, around reportedly 8:30 pm, and after the situation at the embassy in Baghdad had calmed down, the party at Mar-a-Lago officially began:\n\nSee more photos from the party below:\n\nMelania Trump turns heads in glamorous black gown for New Year celebrations with Donald https://t.co/H5xPxBYMsD pic.twitter.com/wRVfyHXFMc \u2014 The 24 Hours News (@The24HoursNews1) January 1, 2020\n\nHappy New Year America!
