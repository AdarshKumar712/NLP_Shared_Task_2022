Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar began the New Year by saying so. While he may have gladdened the hearts of ardent party supporters by saying so, the PTI government in Islamabad belied his contention by an across-the-board tariff hike that both made prices certain to rise, and ensured that jobs would continue to be shed. While gas and electricity tariffs and fuel prices have all gone up, tax targets have been missed yet again, making it all the more difficult to meet the targets set by the IMF for the year.\n\nThe PTI claims just on jobs will not be met by its recent steps. It might be true that the tariff hike in electricity, and the rise in fuel prices, are because of increases in world oil prices, but the jobs it promised to create will remain uncreated. Perhaps most damaging for the government, these price rises will mean that food prices will go up. Fuel price rises mean that tubewell irrigation will cost farmers more, while the cost of transporting food crops to markets will also increase. This is apart from the gas tariff increase, which will mean more expensive fertiliser, and thus more expensive crops. While workers having to pay more for food demand higher wages, manufacturers will also have to contend with these tariff hikes, which will directly impact manufacturing. As if these input costs are not enough of a burden, they also have to deal with high interest rates.\n\nA major problem in tax administration, which has led FBR to have a shortfall of Rs 118 billion on its half-yearly revised target of Rs 2198 billion, is said to have been the resistance to removing certain members, who have been posted because of closeness to senior political figures. Whether promises about 2020 are to do with the financial year, which ends on June 30, or the calendar year, ending December 31, it is unlikely they will be met, no mtter how much senior figures clamour.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/wp-content/themes/focus/assets/img/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 149267971770920}, "google-site-verification": "cecV0Kp7fVbQqEyyglHMAQ9kYCmnv_xp8GwshXyhU2s", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@", "site": "@"}, "og": {"title": "The year of living dangerously", "description": "2020 has started inauspiciously The PTI has of late seemed to deflect criticism of its economic stewardship in 2019 by claims that 2020 is the year of economic progress, of the fulfilment<a href=\"https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2020/01/01/the-year-of-living-dangerously-4/\" title=\"Read more\" >...</a>", "url": "https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2020/01/01/the-year-of-living-dangerously-4/"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "generator": "WordPress 4.9.5"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2020/01/01/the-year-of-living-dangerously-4/"}
