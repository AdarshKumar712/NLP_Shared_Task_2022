From DC, a Yuletide-themed serial killer is stalking the streets of Gotham City in an all-new Batman story arc, and Martian Manhunter faces off against formidable foe in order to save a town in the penultimate issue of an outstanding maxi-series.\n\nMarvel Comics kicks off anew ongoing series taking place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\u2026. We also get a new series featuring the lamest Avenger (who is actually one of the coolest), and Jonathan Hickman and Leinil Francis Yu\u2019s flagship title in the \u201cDawn of X\u2019 initiative focuses on diplomacy and all the rough business that comes with it.\n\n5 Detective Comics #1018\n\nBy: Peter J. Tomasi, Scott Godlewski, David Baron, Rob Leigh, Rafael Sandoval, Jordi Tarragona, and John Kalisz\n\nCOMIXOLOGY\n\nThere\u2019s a killer on the loose in Gotham City, but what else is new? Bruce Wayne\u2019s home town has no shortage of madmen and monsters terrorizing its streets, but after a string of \u201cfestive\u201d murders, The Dark Knight finds himself on the trail of a criminal who bases his crimes on Christmas tradition.\n\nWriter Peter J. Tomasi and artist Scott Godlewski kick off a new story arc appropriately titled \u201cDeath of Winter,\u201d in which the most wonderful time of the year turns deadly and the person behind the carnage has their eyes set Gotham\u2019s favorite son.\n\n4 Martian Manhunter #11\n\nBy: Steve Orlando, Riley Rossmo, Ivan Plascencia, and Deron Bennett\n\nCOMIXOLOGY\n\nDespite their respective powers and fortitude, the duo of J\u2019onn J\u2019onzz and Diane Meade have the deck stacked against them in this penultimate issue of DC Comics\u2019 wild, science fiction 12-issue maxi-series. The only thing standing between Char\u2019rnn O\u2019zzm, the charming red fellow with the winning smile, and the town of Midleton\u2019s destruction is our titular green hero.\n\nMartian Manhunter #11 is a reminder of why this series is so engaging. Its script is propulsive and sharp. And the artwork is kinetic and exaggerated to Tex Avery levels of insanity. This series has been so much fun for the past year, and we\u2019re happy to see it moving toward the epic ending it deserves.\n\n3 Hawkeye: Freefall #1\n\nBy: Matthew Rosenberg, Otto Schmidt, VC\u2019s Joe Sabino, Kim Jacinto, and Tamra Bonvillain\n\nCOMIXOLOGY\n\nThere is a certain level of joy one gets from seeing the character of The Hood pop up in a comic book. That joy stems from the knowledge that you\u2019re going to see a rather obnoxious villain, who everyone sells short too often, get pounded on by Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes. Of course, when that doesn\u2019t exactly happen, things get interesting.\n\nDiving deep into the lore of Clint Barton, such as it is, Hawkeye: Freefall #1 is a fast funny story that echoes the iconic run by Matt Fraction and David Aja, but widens its net for weird and mystic elements. Writer Matthew Rosenberg and artist Otto Schmidt are clearly having a blast here and it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone who picks this book up wouldn\u2019t as well.\n\n2 Star Wars #1\n\nBy: Charles Soule, Jesus Saiz, Arif Prianto, VC\u2019s Clayton Cowles, R.B. Silva, and GURU-eFX\n\nCOMIXOLOGY\n\nTaking place immediately after the events of The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars #1 follows Luke, Leia, Lando, and Chewie after taking nearly escaping with their lives and losing Han Solo\u2026 of course, you already knew all of that. What you may not know is that once free from the Empire-controlled Cloud City, more dangers await.\n\nWith a strong script filled with wonderful characterizations of iconic Star Wars heroes, gorgeous art, and all new villain, this debut issue is a great way to kick the New Year for pop culture\u2019s most celebrated and debated space opera.\n\n1 X-Men #4\n\nBy: Jonathan Hickman, Leinil Francis Yu, Gerry Alanguilan, Sunny Gho, VC\u2019s Clayton Cowles, and Tom Muller\n\nCOMIXOLOGY\n\nJonathan Hickman and Leinil Francis Yu\u2019s flagship title in the \u201cDawn of X\u201d fleet speeds ahead in X-Men #4. The leaders of Krakoa attend the World Economic Forum, which, on the surface, sounds like yawner of a plot. Thankfully, where the X-Men go, trouble tends to follow.\n\nBrokering peace is no easy task, especially when one nation in that discussion is populated with characters who could potentially annihilate an entire country with their abilities. Hickman and Yu explore the idea of a country birthed in a contentious position, wherein their mere existence frightens other world leaders. Complex, well-written, and wonderfully illustrated X-Men #4 is another winner for the new state of Marvel\u2019s mutant roster.\n\nNEXT: X-Men: 10 Things You Didn't Know About Charles Xavier\n\nWe hope you like the items we recommend!
