Fr. Ejike Mbaka, the Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry in Enugu, southeast Nigeria, has prophecies for the year 2020.\n\nNaija News reports that Rev. Mbaka released the prophecies during his Adoration Ministry in Enugu when he was addressing his congregation last week Thursday.\n\nRev. Mbaka, who predicted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s reelection, was quoted to have said during his 2019 Passover ministration that there would be more hard times for Nigerians in 2020.\n\nThe Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry said Senator Hope Uzodinma, the 2019 APC governorship candidate for Imo State, Southeast Nigeria, would take over the governance of Imo State from the Incumbent governor, Chief Emeka Ihedioha.\n\nWhile maintaining that all the prophecy in Adoration ground has come to pass, Rev. Mbaka revealed that he did not know how the revelation would manifest.\n\nThe controversial clergyman warned those who would not be satisfied with the message not to come after him, stressing that such action would attract the wrath of the Holy Spirit upon such individuals or groups, referencing the Holy Bible in the process.\n\nBelow are Rev. Mbaka\u2019s 2020 prophecies\u2026\n\n\u201cMany things are going to happen in Nigeria this 2020 that will shock countrymen and countrywomen, but all would be to God\u2019s glory.\n\n\u201cIn spite of all the hard time that would happen this 2020, there is hope.\n\n\u201cIn Imo State, there is hope. Hope, hope, hope \u2026 hope in Imo State!\n\n\u201cImo people have suffered but God is raising a new hope that would be an agent of salvation for them.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming with a new flag to restore the dignity of that noble land. A new leadership that will break barriers and there would be joy in the land of Imo.\n\n\u201cLift your candles as I bless Hope Uzodinma; and I empower him to, spiritually, to take over. How I do not know.\n\n\u201cPlease, if you heard that there would be a new government in Imo and you don\u2019t like the message; if I say, Hope, you can say hopeless but do not fight me.\n\n\u201cI am saying this in respect of those who may want to come after me because of the message. If you do that, the God of Moses, Elijah and Elisha will deal with you. I am only a messenger of God\u201d.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Philips Sunday"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Rev.
