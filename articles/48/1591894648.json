designation for the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo but said the sharp decline in cases was \u201cextremely positive\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs long as there is a single case of Ebola in an area as insecure and unstable as eastern DRC, the potential remains for a much larger epidemic,\u201d WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told journalists in Geneva on Wednesday.\n\nTedros expressed hope that the emergency could be lifted within the next three months on the advice of the WHO\u2019s emergency committee of international experts.\n\nThe WHO last July declared the Ebola outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d \u2013 a designation that gives the UN health agency greater powers to restrict travel and boost funding.\n\nTedros on Tuesday said only three cases had been reported in the past week in the DRC.\n\nBut for the epidemic to be declared over, there have to be no new cases reported for 42 days \u2013 double the incubation period.\n\nThe health emergency designation last year came a few days after a patient was diagnosed with the virus in the provincial capital Goma, the first case in a major urban hub.\n\nMore than a month before that, the WHO reported that the virus had spread to Uganda for the first time.\n\nThe recent outbreak was first identified in August 2018 and has since killed more than 2,300 people in eastern DRC \u2013 an area where several militia groups are operating.\n\nThis is the second-worst outbreak of the disease since 2014, when it killed about 11,000 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\nEfforts to contain the current outbreak have been hindered by attacks on health workers and conflicts in the east.\n\n", "keywords": [],
