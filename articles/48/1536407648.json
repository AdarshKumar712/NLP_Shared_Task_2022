He\u2019s a democratic socialist, and that\u2019s different.\n\nBut it\u2019s not, because democratic socialism doesn\u2019t exist. That\u2019s because it can\u2019t exist, because socialism can\u2019t take hold in a truly democratic system.\n\nIn order for socialism to \u201cwork,\u201d the state has to take control of major industries like health care, energy and manufacturing. It has to confiscate massive amounts of private wealth. It has to control the means of production and distribution. It has to control wages and prices. It has to monopolize things like higher education.\n\nThat can\u2019t work in a democratic environment because people might run for office who think these things should be controlled by the private sector. Or they might think taxes should be cut. Or they might think the power of the federal government should be limited to what the Constitution says.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople like this might get elected, and they might do what they believe should be done. They might privatize the industries, cut the taxes, limit the government. They might make people go out and earn what they need rather than just giving it to them.\n\nCandidates like this will be called \u201cdemagogues\u201d by socialist overlords and their media cheerleaders, but they are only advocating for the system that made America the world\u2019s most prosperous nation over the course of more than two decades. Many voters will find their message appealing. They might actually gain power.\n\nAnd if they do, socialism is history. In fact, given the inevitable failure that socialism produces, this scenario is inevitable in any country that tries socialism and maintains democratic institutions. As soon as the voters have the opportunity to elect new leaders who will get rid of socialist laws and institutions, they will do it.\n\nThat is why socialists always establish systems in which their socialism can\u2019t be taken down. They either put an end to free elections or they write the laws in such a way that they\u2019re impossible to repeal even when new leadership comes to power.\n\nConsider the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created through a law written by Elizabeth Warren . The CFPB has unprecedented power to sue and investigate banks and private companies. During the Obama administration, it was allowed to run wild. But Warren wrote the enabling law in such a way that Congress can\u2019t cut its funding, which comes directly from the Federal Reserve.\n\nShe also wrote it to make it almost impossible for a president to fire the director. Indeed, when Obama-appointed director Richard Cordray stepped down several months into the Trump administration , he actually tried to name his own replacement.\n\nThat didn\u2019t work, but it took a court battle to stop it.\n\nThis is the sort of thing socialists do all the time to make sure they don\u2019t lose power, no matter what happens in elections, assuming elections are even allowed to happen. They will burrow into the bureaucracy. They will find friendly judges to overrule duly elected officials or the people.\n\nSocialists never give up an inch of power once they attain it, which makes \u201cdemocracy\u201d meaningless in a socialist system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are no democratic socialists. You are either democratic, or you\u2019re a socialist.\n\nBernie Sanders is a socialist, and if he\u2019s given power, he and his socialist allies will never give it up.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["YOUR KEYWORDS HERE"], "tags": ["News"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "http://www.yourdestinationnow.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "generator": "blogger", "og": {"url": "http://www.yourdestinationnow.com/2020/02/herman-cain-theres-no-such-thing-as.html", "title": "Herman Cain: There's No Such Thing as \"Democratic\" Socialism", "description": "Your Destination Of pure Entertainment", "type": "article", "site_name": "YourDestinationNow"}, "keywords": "YOUR KEYWORDS HERE", "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.yourdestinationnow.com/", "title": "Herman Cain: There's No Such Thing as \"Democratic\" Socialism", "card": "summary", "site": "@username", "creator": "@username", "description": "Bernie Sanders would have you believe that he is not like the socialists who have ruined Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba and \u2013 going back a few..."}, "fb": {"app_id": "Facebook App ID here", "admins": "Facebook Admin ID here"}}, "canonical_link": "http://www.yourdestinationnow.com/2020/02/herman-cain-theres-no-such-thing-as.html"}
