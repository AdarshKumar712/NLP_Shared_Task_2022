In Punjab, Vedanta-owned TSPL units were producing power, as were state-run plants at Ropar and Bhatinda.\n\nMohammed Shayin, managing director at northern Haryana state-run power generator HPGCL said all units other than ones under scheduled maintenance were operational, adding that the utility was \"pleading\" with federal authorities to extend the emissions deadline.\n\nPrivate producers such as Vedanta and Larsen & Toubro Ltd argued for yet another extension to the deadline.\n\nL&T-owned Nabha Power Ltd said it was \"constrained to shut down both its units due to a delay in extension of timelines by the CPCB\".\n\nVedanta said it was \"confident\" that authorities \"would take a considerate stand\".\n\n\"We shall shut the plant in case we get the directions from the CPCB or the environment ministry,\" the company said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES", "INDIA", "POWER PLANTS", "AIR POLLUTION"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 23:06:09 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "NEW DELHI (REUTERS) - Coal-fired utilities around New Delhi were still operating on Wednesday (Jan 1) despite threats from the Indian authorities to close them down if they had not installed equipment to cut emissions of sulphur oxides by the end of the year..
