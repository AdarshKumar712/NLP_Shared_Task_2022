Employees performed mock rehearsals Tuesday night to check ID\u2019s and take orders.\n\n\u201cWe just expect a lot of people,\u201d Dillman said. \u201cWe have processes in place so hopefully nobody will wait for too long.\u201d\n\nWisconsin will become an island where both medical and recreational marijuana remain illegal and likely will for some time.\n\n\u201cPeople are demanding this,\u201d Gov. Tony Evers said in a recent interview with affiliate WISN 12 News.\n\nEvers is pushing for a vote on medical marijuana legislation that has received bipartisan support, but Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald has indicated its likely sudden death in the state Senate.\n\n\u201cThe idea that somehow there\u2019s a handful of people in the Senate that don\u2019t want it or the Assembly,\u201d Evers said. \u201cLet\u2019s vote and see.\u201d\n\nStore managers said they will remind Wisconsin residents of current state law, making it illegal to transport any amount of marijuana over the state line.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Chris Watkins"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://quincy-network.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/cropped-cropped-waow-e1526504132358-1-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "People begin camping out ahead of legal marijuana in Illinois - WAOW", "description": "Two people showed up just before 5 p.m. Tuesday, 13 hours before the Rise Mundelein dispensary would open and sell recreational marijuana for the first time, foreshadowing the potential onslaught of interest in the weeks to come.", "url": "https://waow.com/2020/01/01/people-begin-camping-out-ahead-of-legal-marijuana-in-illinois/", "site_name": "WAOW", "updated_time": "2020-01-01T14:14:43+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://quincy-network.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/campout.jpg", "secure_url": "https://quincy-network.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/campout.jpg", "width": 781, "height": 422}}, "article": {"section": "Top Stories", "published_time": "2020-01-01T14:14:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T14:14:43+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Two people showed up just before 5 p.m. Tuesday, 13 hours before the Rise Mundelein dispensary would open and sell recreational marijuana for the first time, foreshadowing the potential onslaught of interest in the weeks to come.", "title": "People begin camping out ahead of legal marijuana in Illinois - WAOW", "image": "https://quincy-network.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/campout.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://quincy-network.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/cropped-cropped-waow-e1526504132358-1-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://waow.com/2020/01/01/people-begin-camping-out-ahead-of-legal-marijuana-in-illinois/"}
