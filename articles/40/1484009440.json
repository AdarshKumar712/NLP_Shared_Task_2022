Few years have as much riding on them as 2020. Either we will get rid of Trump and start repairing the damage he\u2019s wrought, or we will be stuck with an unfettered orange man for another four years.\n\nThe stakes are high, so the resolutions should match them. Here\u2019s are some things that we\u2019re promise to keep in mind as the months go by.\n\nRelated: Meet the lesbian chef creating gourmet meals & delivering them to sex workers\n\nDon\u2019t freak out when the Senate acquits Trump.\n\nAs sure as the sun rises in the east, the Republican-controlled Senate will vote to acquit the president of the impeachment charges against him. GOP Senators have already signaled that their minds are made up.\n\nIn the words of Trump-lover Lindsey Graham, \u201cThis thing will come to the Senate, and it will die quickly, and I will do everything I can to make it die quickly.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that the process was in vain. But just like the Mueller Report, impeachment was never going to be the mechanism for removing Trump from office. That opportunity happens on November 3. So don\u2019t get dejected when Trump gets to stay in office. With any luck, it will just be for a few more months.\n\nSend Ruth Bader Ginsburg lots and lots of vitamins.\n\nThe Supreme Court is already tilted toward conservatives. But if another justice decides to leave the bench voluntarily or otherwise, the results would be a solid right-wing block that would do everything to erase LGBTQ progress. The justice whose health is most open to speculation is Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a reliable liberal vote.\n\nLast year, Ginsburg was hospitalized for a stomach bug; more seriously, in 2018 she underwent treatment for lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. At 85, the Justice is remarkably resilient, and she\u2019s indicated she intends to stay on the bench as long as she can.\n\nBut if she falters, Republicans will ram through another right-wing nominee, disregarding the supposed respect for voters they used to block Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination. We need Ginsburg to stay healthy, at least until a Democrat can choose her replacement. If you can\u2019t send vitamins, send chicken soup.\n\nResolve not to talk smack about Democrats.\n\nEveryone\u2019s favorite pastime is trashing Democrats. It\u2019s even the Democrats\u2019 favorite pastime. But with the stakes so high, grousing about policy differences that are a matter of degree is counterproductive.\n\nYes, Medicare for All versus Medicare for All Who Want It is a significant difference. But compared to the Republicans\u2019 desire to repeal Obamacare altogether, the differences are small potatoes.\n\n2020 is the year to keep the focus on the real goal: dumping Trump.\n\nEnjoy the good news.\n\nThe new year isn\u2019t going to be all doom and gloom. Sure, politics will be overwhelming because of what\u2019s at stake. But there will be some fun too.\n\nThe Summer Olympics is bound to highlight some new out athletes who will capture our imagination. The arts are guaranteed to deliver some joy. Just one example: the movie version of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s In the Heights, complete with a new lesbian plot, will hit screens during Pride Month.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Pride Month itself\u2014thirty days of celebration that no political dark clouds can ever dim.\n\nGet Pete to wear a colored shirt.\n\nDoes Pete Buttigieg wear a white oxford shirt to bed? He certainly wears it virtually every place else. Just about every photo of the presidential candidate shows him in a white shirt, with no sports jacket.\n\nWe\u2019d like to resolve to have Pete get a little more colorful. How about (gasp!) a blue shirt? Or maybe even a pattern, as long as it\u2019s not argyle? We get that the white shirt with rolled-up sleeves shows that Pete is serious, but he doesn\u2019t need a sartorial crutch to prove that point.\n\nHow about a little style? After all, he is the first major gay presidential candidate.\n\nVote.\n\nThis is the easiest resolution of all.\n\nDon\u2019t take the election results for granted. Even if the polls show Trump losing by a landslide, cast your ballot. The lesson of 2016 is not to take the results for granted.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget about the Senate. A Democratic president won\u2019t get much done if the GOP still calls the shots in the Senate.\n\nWith any luck, when 2021 rolls around, our resolutions will all be about getting back on the road to justice.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "Pete Buttigieg", "Impeachment", "Lin-Manuel Miranda", "2020 election", "Donald Trump"], "authors": ["John Gallagher"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 09:00:05 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "With any luck, when 2021 rolls around, our resolutions will all be about getting back on the road to justice...", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "LGBTQ Nation", "description": "With any luck, when 2021 rolls around, our resolutions will all be about getting back on the road to justice...", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/01/new-year-resolutions-lgbtq-people-can-share/", "title": "Here are New Year resolutions that all LGBTQ people can share", "image": {"identifier": "https://lgbtqnation-assets.imgix.net/2020/01/happy-new-year-2020-scaled.jpg?fit=crop&auto=format&auto=compress&crop=faces", "width": 2560, "height": 1619}}, "description": "With any luck, when 2021 rolls around, our resolutions will all be about getting back on the road to justice...", "twitter": {"image": {"identifier": "https://lgbtqnation-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/2020/01/happy-new-year-2020-scaled.jpg", "alt": "Happy New Year 2020!
