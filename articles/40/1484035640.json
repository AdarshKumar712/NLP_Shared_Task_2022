He says the suspect stabbed him in the chest so many times with a screwdriver, it punctured a hole in his jacket.\n\nIt happened around 7:35 p.m. Saturday inside an apartment building near Briggs Avenue and East Kingsbridge Road in Fordham Manor.\n\n\u201cHe threw me to the floor under the table. He kept attacking me, trying to find my wallet,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nGomez says he was unlocking the front door to his apartment on Briggs Avenue Saturday evening when the attacker captured on surveillance video snuck up behind him.\n\nThe suspect then allegedly pulled out the screwdriver and told the man to hand over money.\n\n\u201cHe told me he was going to kill me, but he never imagined that I was going to fight back. I myself didn\u2019t think I was going to fight back,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nGomez says he managed to kick and even grabbed a bottle to smash against the suspect\u2019s head. The intruder eventually ran away, dropping the victim\u2019s wallet during his escape.\n\nPolice say the victim suffered cuts to his hands and was taken to a local hospital for treatment.\n\nGomez\u2019s roommate was also home and heard the minutes-long scuffle, but was too scared to intervene. He told CBS2 he was also the victim of a robbery years ago inside that same apartment.\n\n\u201cI watch the news, they kill for one dollar. It\u2019s terrible,\u201d Leo Barbecho said.\n\nGomez and his roommate say the experience has taught them to always watch out for who they let into the building.\n\nAnyone who has information regarding this incident is asked to call the NYPD\u2019s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-8477 or for Spanish, 1-888-577-4782.
