The catch is that Google services aren't include in the devices.\n\nThe Huawei devices won't be available in the US, but the Mate lineup highlights how Huawei is using stock Android, its latest Kirin processors, 5G connectivity and perks that may appeal in Europe and elsewhere. CNET outlined the devices including the MatePad Pro, a 10.8-inch tablet that rhymes with Apple's iPad Pro and an update to Huawei's Mate X foldable device.\n\nGoogle outlined how Huawei is prohibited from using Gmail, Maps, YouTube, Play Store and other apps for preload or download on the devices. Huawei and Google can only work together to support Huawei devices available to the public on or before May 16, 2019.\n\nWith the launch begins a grand experiment on whether a lack of Google services is a gating factor for Huawei. Wedbush technology strategist Brad Gastwirth noted that Huawei's fortunes will ride primarily on demand in China going forward.\n\nHuawei's laptop, a refreshed MateBook X Pro, runs on Windows 10 and has a 13.9-inch screen and the latest Intel processors.\n\nMore:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Hardware", "Security", "Cloud", "Topics", "Huawei", "AI", "Executive Guides", "See All Topics", "5G", "Windows 10", "Innovation", "5G: What it means for IoT", "Enterprise Software"], "authors": ["Larry Dignan"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Huawei outlined updates to its Mate lineup, but they won't have Google services included.
