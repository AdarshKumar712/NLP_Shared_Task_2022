Rowling. The Hogwarts Headmaster was originally played by Irish actor Richard Harris. After his untimely death following the second film, the studio was tasked with recasting the role. Michael Gambon was chosen as the replacement, portraying the character for the remainder of the films; however, there were other names on the list throughout both stages of casting the prominent role.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore served as Harry Potter's primary mentor during the young wizard's time at Hogwarts. Over time, Harry and his friends started to understand just how much influence Dumbledore had on the wizarding world. He was a half-blood wizard with immense powers and strength for leading through the toughest of times. Dumbledore founded the Order of the Phoenix and stood as a symbol of resistance following Lord Voldemort's second uprising. Even after the wizard's tragic death, Dumbledore's legacy lived on.\n\nContinue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view.\n\nRelated: Why The Harry Potter Movies Cut Professor Binns\n\nNot only did Warner Bros. and the team behind the film adaptations have a difficult task in casting a major role, but they had to do it multiple times. Dumbledore was just one of a small handful of characters to appear in every Harry Potter movie. Whoever was chosen for the role had to be available and dedicated to the role for the long-term. A few actors were considered before Harris acquired the role ahead of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Actor Patrick McGoohan reportedly had an interest in the role but stepped away from acting due to health reasons in the early 2000s. Sean Connery was also targeted but the actor was against the idea of committing to a children's movie about wizards. The list of \"could have been\" Dumbledore actors would grow in just a few years.\n\nThe Actors Considered When Dumbledore Was Recast\n\nFollowing the actor's tragic passing in 2002, an even larger list of actors was rumored to be in line for his replacement. Christopher Lee was the producers' top choice in replacing Harris but he was forced to decline the offer due to scheduling conflicts. Harris' fellow Lord of the Rings veteran Ian McKellen was also considered. McKellen, however, expressed discomfort at the prospect of taking over the role of Dumbledore because Harris had previously criticized McKellen's acting style.\n\nIn addition, Peter O'Toole was reportedly considered but the studio worried that his age would become troublesome down the line. Acclaimed Indian actor, Naseeruddin Shah, has shared that his agent urged him to audition but he declined the opportunity. In the end, Gambon took over as Dumbledore which ended up becoming one of his best-known roles. It's always a tough task to replace an actor due to illness or death, but the studio successfully honored the original actor while giving the next stage of the role to an appreciative person. There's no doubt that some of the names mentioned above would have knocked the role out of the park in Harry Potter, but Gambon never took the chance of playing Dumbledore for granted.\n\nNext: Harry Potter\u2019s Bizarre \u201cDumbledore Is Time-Traveling Ron\u201d Theory Explained\n\nShare Tweet Email\n\nStar Trek Picard: How The New Series Can Avoid Voyager\u2019s Mistakes", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Harry Potter", "harry potter", "Lord of the Rings"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 07:01:03 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Harry Potter film series features Albus Dumbledore, played by Richard Harris and Michael Gambon; Ian McKellen and others were also considered.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/public/build/images/favicon-32x32.3fd37a19.png", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "description": "The Harry Potter film series features Albus Dumbledore, played by Richard Harris and Michael Gambon; Ian McKellen and others were also considered.", "og": {"title": "Harry Potter: Here Are The Actors Who Almost Played Dumbledore", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Richard-Harris-and-Michael-Gambon-in-Harry-Potter1.jpg", "width": 1400, "height": 700}, "url": "https://screenrant.com/harry-potter-dumbledore-actors-mcgoohan-connery-lee-mckellen/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The role of Albus Dumbledore had to be cast multiple times for the Harry Potter film series, and a number of actors were considered for the part.", "site_name": "ScreenRant"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T07:01:03Z", "section": "SR Originals"}, "fb": {"app_id": 822150531210883}}, "canonical_link": "https://screenrant.com/harry-potter-dumbledore-actors-mcgoohan-connery-lee-mckellen/"}
