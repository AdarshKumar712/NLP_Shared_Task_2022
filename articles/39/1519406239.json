Early elections would become a distinct possibility.\n\nMerz has never forgiven Merkel for driving him out as head of the party\u2019s group of MPs in the Bundestag in 2002.\n\nHe was narrowly beaten in the vote for party leader by Merkel\u2019s preferred successor Kramp-Karrenbauer in December 2018, and has been waiting in the wings ever since.\n\nReturn to full-time politics\n\nHe announced this month he was quitting his job on the supervisory board of the German arm of investment firm BlackRock to dedicate himself to politics and to helping the CDU \u201crenew itself\u201d.\n\nIn recent months Merz has attacked Merkel and her \u201cfailed\u201d leadership. Favoured by the CDU\u2019s most conservative members, Merz wants to shift the party to the right to woo back voters lost to the anti-Islam, anti-immigrant AfD.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer opted out of the race after barely a year in the post \u2014 a period marked by internal battles over whether to cooperate with the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD).AKK, as Kramp-Karrenbauer is popularly known, said she had had \u201ca difficult time\u201d as party leader.\n\nWhile the CDU party has a policy of no cooperation with either the far left or far right at a national level, regional CDU lawmakers last week nevertheless voted with MPs from the AfD to oust a far-left state premier in Thuringia.\n\nThe breach in the political firewall against the AfD prompted Merkel\u2019s junior partners in the national government, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), to call urgent talks at the weekend about the partnership\u2019s future.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Friedrich Merz", "Angela Merkel", "German Chancellor"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Feb 12 20:05:08 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Friedrich Merz, a longtime rival of Angela Merkel within the ruling CDU party, is hoping to replace her as German chancellor, local media", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 176502461635, "app_id": 1056657517707298}, "description": "Friedrich Merz, a longtime rival of Angela Merkel within the ruling CDU party, is hoping to replace her as German chancellor, local media reported Wednesday.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Merkel rival Merz in bid to succeed her as German Chancellor", "description": "Friedrich Merz, a longtime rival of Angela Merkel within the ruling CDU party, is hoping to replace her as German chancellor, local media reported Wednesday.", "url": "https://guardian.ng/news/world/merkel-rival-merz-in-bid-to-succeed-her-as-german-chancellor/", "site_name": "The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News", "image": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Friedrich-Merz-640x360.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ngrguardian", "tag": "German Chancellor", "section": "World", "published_time": "2020-02-12T20:05:08+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Friedrich Merz, a longtime rival of Angela Merkel within the ruling CDU party, is hoping to replace her as German chancellor, local media reported Wednesday.", "title": "Merkel rival Merz in bid to succeed her as German Chancellor", "site": "@GuardianNigeria", "image": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Friedrich-Merz-640x360.jpg", "creator": "@NGRGUARDIANNEWS"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.9.5", "news_keywords": "Angela Merkel, Friedrich Merz, German Chancellor"}, "canonical_link": "https://guardian.ng/news/world/merkel-rival-merz-in-bid-to-succeed-her-as-german-chancellor/"}
