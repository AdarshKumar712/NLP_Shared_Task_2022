Frank Lampard spent the majority of a scrappy contest bemoaning his young team\u2019s lack of conviction in the final third and they ended up learning a harsh lesson, conceding a late equaliser when Alireza Jahanbakhsh came off the bench to rescue a draw for Brighton & Hove Albion with an astonishing bicycle kick.\n\nChelsea were ragged in the end and Brighton could even have snatched an unlikely win, only for Kepa Arrizabalaga to make a vital save from Neal Maupay\u2019s low drive. Lampard could only watch with a concerned expression on his face as Brighton\u2019s spirited comeback gathered pace. It was poor from Chelsea given their earlier dominance and another bland attacking display will surely convince the Stamford Bridge club to take advantage of their transfer ban being lifted this month.\n\nNewcastle United v Leicester City: Premier League \u2013 live! Read more\n\nIt had all looked so promising during the first 20 minutes. Chelsea were back to 4-2-3-1 after ditching their 3-4-3 system 34 minutes into their victory over Arsenal and they took control from the start, bossing possession and threatening down the flanks. It was an attacking line-up from Lampard, with Mason Mount\u2019s movement in the No 10 role causing problems for Brighton, and the inclusion of Reece James at right-back gave Chelsea an extra option in attacking positions. There is an adventurousness to James and the opening goal arrived when the 19-year-old, who had made a surprisingly quick recovery from an ankle injury, charged forward to win a corner.\n\nWillian\u2019s delivery was lifted high to the far post, where Kurt Zouma was able to rise unchallenged and head back into the middle for Tammy Abraham to shoot from close range. Aaron Mooy blocked on the line and the ball broke to C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, onside and free to turn in his third goal of the season.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta taps in from close range to give Chelsea an early lead at Brighton.

But perhaps it was too easy. Complacency set in and there were flashes of frustration from Lampard as the dynamic started to shift. He wanted his forwards to show more conviction and he grew irritable on the touchline, turning away in disgust when Tammy Abraham wasted a decent opportunity in the 28th minute.\n\nAbraham shot when he could have released Willian, who was unmarked to his right, and it is precisely that kind of raw decision-making that Lampard will take into consideration when he devises his transfer plans this month.\n\nToo many of Chelsea\u2019s attacks were breaking down in careless fashion and Brighton almost made them pay shortly before half-time, Neal Maupay scurrying down the left and teeing up Leandro Trossard to test Kepa with a curling effort. Kepa saved and Martin Montoya blazed the rebound wide.\n\nJack Grealish inspires Villa to victory at Burnley after latest VAR controversy Read more\n\nBrighton, who lost Dan Burn when the left-back suffered a shoulder injury during an aerial collision with James, were gaining belief. Graham Potter had tweaked his side\u2019s approach midway through the first half, jettisoning the diamond and matching Chelsea\u2019s system, and he made another alteration during the interval, removing Yves Bissouma and bolstering his attack with the introduction of Aaron Connolly. The change meant Brighton were using a 4-4-2 and the game became frantic.\n\nPotter had thrown caution to the wind, a risky move bearing in mind Chelsea\u2019s speed on the counterattack, but the visitors were unable to capitalise. Christian Pulisic\u2019s incursions from the left ended in disappointment and Lampard opted for a more conservative approach in the closing stages, replacing Mount with Mateo Kovacic.\n\nBrighton were pressing hard, almost equalising when Connolly brought the best out of Kepa, and they finally made the breakthrough when Lewis Dunk\u2019s header looped to Jahanbakhsh. The Iranian winger, surprisingly named on the bench after ending ended his long wait for a goal for the club against Bournemouth last weekend, leapt through the air and sent the ball soaring into the net with an incredible exhibiton of technique and athleticism.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Premier League", "Brighton & Hove Albion", "Chelsea", "Football", "Sport"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jacob Steinberg"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh hit a superb equaliser six minutes from time to earn Brighton a 1-1 draw after C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta had given Chelsea an early lead", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/fee5e2d638d1c35f6d501fa397e53329/152x152.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh hit a superb equaliser six minutes from time to earn Brighton a 1-1 draw after C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta had given Chelsea an early lead", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Jacob Steinberg", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6821484be2a7367f5dc8a95b6062ca366a0a0251/127_88_3373_2024/master/3373.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e425bf819638221228ea9c9c7fc59995", "keywords": "Premier League,Brighton & Hove Albion,Chelsea,Football,Sport", "news_keywords": "Premier League,Brighton & Hove Albion,Chelsea,Football,Sport", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/01/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6821484be2a7367f5dc8a95b6062ca366a0a0251/127_88_3373_2024/master/3373.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5fffc7a2db28d6fefd1422438de07525", "description": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh hit a superb equaliser six minutes from time to earn Brighton a 1-1 draw after C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta had given Chelsea an early lead", "type": "article", "title": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh\u2019s overhead stunner for Brighton denies Chelsea", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jacob-steinberg", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Football", "published_time": "2020-01-01T14:49:27.000Z", "tag": "Premier League,Brighton & Hove Albion,Chelsea,Football,Sport", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T14:57:45.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://football/2020/jan/01/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://football/2020/jan/01/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/01/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report", "iphone": "gnmguardian://football/2020/jan/01/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6821484be2a7367f5dc8a95b6062ca366a0a0251/127_88_3373_2024/master/3373.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f79950865aa2386af552ce0c1752e168", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JacobSteinberg", "dnt": "on"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/01/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report"}
