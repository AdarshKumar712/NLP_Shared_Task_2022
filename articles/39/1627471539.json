Madeleine was a sweet little girl and my son was a small, sweet boy, and he was also the same age. A whole lot about the two cases fits together.\n\n\"For me, it would be enough to learn that my son sunk in the Atlantic. But when I think that he maybe fell into the hands of a paedophile, I think \u2018god, what did he do with my child?\u2019 Then it's much worse, I believe.\n\n\"I found that what Madeleine's parents did, working with the British press to constantly remind everyone about it all the time, was good.\n\n\"It wasn\u2019t like that with my son in Germany. The authorities were not so active. For us we got nothing, zero - it was a tragic game.\"\n\nThe new development in Ren\u00e9's case comes after prosecutors re-opened the probe into the disappearance of German five-year-old Inga Gehricke, who vanished during a family outing in Saxony-Anhalt on May 2, 2015.\n\nPolice in Germany and the Metropolitan Police have declined to comment on whether Ren\u00e9's case is being linked to the investigation into Madeleine's disappearance.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Madeleine McCann", "News", "Standard", "UK News"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Phoebe Southworth", "Daniel Wighton", "Danny Boyle", "Emma Gatten", "Our Foreign Staff", "Press Association"], "publish_date": "Sat Jun  6 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Six-year-old Ren\u00e9 Hasee was on holiday with his family in Aljezur, 25 miles from Praia da Luz, when he vanished on June 21, 1996", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2c769d", "msapplication-TileImage": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "The Telegraph", "msapplication-config": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-70x70.png", "description": "Six-year-old Ren\u00e9 Hasee was on holiday with his family in Aljezur, 25 miles from Praia da Luz, when he vanished on June 21, 1996", "keywords": "Madeleine McCann,News,Standard,UK News", "tmgads.channel": "news", "tmgads.section": "news-2020", "tmgads.zone": "news.2020.06.06", "tmgads.articleid": "AvbjPQ0LwtRS", "tmgads.pagetype": "story", "tmgads.level": 5, "tmgads.geo": "US", "tmgads.keywords": "Madeleine McCann,News,Standard,UK News", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.Category": 2020, "DCSext.Genre": 6, "DCSext.MLC": "/news/2020/06/06", "DCSext.articleId": "AvbjPQ0LwtRS", "DCSext.Content_Type": "story", "DCSext.Level": 5, "DCSext.author": "Phoebe Southworth; Daniel Wighton", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2020-06-06 11:46", "DCSext.cf": 0, "DCSext.cd": 0, "DCSext.cn": 0, "DCSext.pd": 1, "og": {"title": "Father of boy who disappeared in Algarve in 1996 claims police are re-opening his son's case", "description": "Six-year-old Ren\u00e9 Hasee was on holiday with his family in Aljezur, 25 miles from Praia da Luz, when he vanished on June 21, 1996", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Telegraph", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/06/father-boy-disappeared-algarve-1996-claims-police-re-opening/", "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/06/06/TELEMMGLPICT000232557120-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOLSIyYLmkFq7W-G_CKMXcSX9nveTY1voWeMadern8Zk.jpeg?imwidth=1200"}, "twitter": {"title": "Father of boy who disappeared in Algarve in 1996 claims police are re-opening his son's case", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/06/father-boy-disappeared-algarve-1996-claims-police-re-opening/", "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/06/06/TELEMMGLPICT000232557120-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOLSIyYLmkFq7W-G_CKMXcSX9nveTY1voWeMadern8Zk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "site": "@TelegraphNews", "description": "Six-year-old Ren\u00e9 Hasee was on holiday with his family in Aljezur, 25 miles from Praia da Luz, when he vanished on June 21, 1996", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "tmgads.businessSegment": "news", "tmg.premium.override": "true", "tmg.premium.state": "false", "premiumContentOnFirstPublish": "false", "article": {"content_tier": "free"}, "fb": {"pages": 122346694516955}, "theme-color": "#072A3A", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#072A3A", "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:standard,max-video-preview:-1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/06/father-boy-disappeared-algarve-1996-claims-police-re-opening/"}
