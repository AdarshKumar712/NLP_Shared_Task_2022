Angela Merkel has been noticed during the last few days, to not shake hands with anyone. People are being advised to keep their physical contact to a minimum to contain the outbreak of the coronavirus and to stay at least one meter away from each other, if possible.\n\nA tweet, with a new greeting called \u201cThe Wuhan Shake\u201d has recently been spread over the internet. In the video, people are seen avoiding shaking hands and instead greet each other with their feet! What do you say? Will it catch on in Spain? Is the cheek-kissing tradition about to get competition?\n\n-- Advertisement --\n\n\n\nPeople in China found another way to greet since they can't shake hands. The Wuhan Shake. I love how people can adapt and keep a sense of humor about stressful situations. pic.twitter.com/P8MSfOdJ2H \u2014 \u2022*\u00a8*\u2022.\u00b8\u00b8\u272f*\uff65\ud83c\udf43\u13c9\ud83c\udf43\u2022*\u00a8*\u2022.\u00b8\u00b8\u272f*\u00a8 (@V_actually) February 29, 2020\n\n(Source: Twitter)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": "Wed Mar  4 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "People in Italy have been advised to stop greeting each other with kisses.
