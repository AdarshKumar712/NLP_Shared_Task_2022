He said: \"As the New Year approaches, I am filled with excitement at the possibilities of what lies ahead, but unsettled at the same time by the awesomeness of it all.\n\n\"The New Year chimes will scarcely have subsided when we find ourselves confronted by harsh reality.\n\n\"Brexit looms in all its complexity.\n\n\"There will be renewed efforts to cut the Gordian knot at Stormont and to restore political institutions.\n\n\"Also in Northern Ireland the less well-off are threatened by impending changes to the welfare system, while in the Republic various crises - homelessness, a shortage of social housing and rent costs - defy solution.\n\n\"Globally the damage we are doing to our planet is becoming more obvious and more frightening.\n\n\"In the face of such challenges it would be easy, indeed entirely understandable, to become dispirited. But as Christians we are people of faith and hope.\"\n\nBelfast Telegraph", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["belfasttelegraph"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A New Year message from the main church leaders has called for \"courageous decision-making\" in order to make political progress in 2020.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn-02.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/static/65878e062b4890b48f61c325264e809c8a5eee53/img/favicon-belfasttelegraph.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "belfasttelegraph", "description": "A New Year message from the main church leaders has called for \"courageous decision-making\" in order to make political progress in 2020.", "news_keywords": "Church leaders call on Northern Ireland politicians to make 'courageous' decisions in 2020 - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk", "og": {"title": "Church leaders call on Northern Ireland politicians to make 'courageous' decisions in 2020 - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk", "site_name": "BelfastTelegraph.co.uk", "description": "A New Year message from the main church leaders has called for \"courageous decision-making\" in order to make political progress in 2020.", "url": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/church-leaders-call-on-northern-ireland-politicians-to-make-courageous-decisions-in-2020-38825298.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/republic-of-ireland/e9059/38825765.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/priest.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 607, "height": 342}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@BelTel", "url": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/church-leaders-call-on-northern-ireland-politicians-to-make-courageous-decisions-in-2020-38825298.html", "title": "Church leaders call on Northern Ireland politicians to make 'courageous' decisions in 2020", "description": "A New Year message from the main church leaders has called for \"courageous decision-making\" in order to make political progress in 2020.", "image": {"src": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/republic-of-ireland/e9059/38825765.ece/ALTERNATES/w135square/priest.jpg"}, "domain": "BelfastTelegraph.co.uk"}, "published-date": "Wed, 01 Jan 2020 07:00:00 GMT", "fb": {"app_id": 321217294648139}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1229633020, app-argument=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/church-leaders-call-on-northern-ireland-politicians-to-make-courageous-decisions-in-2020-38825298.html"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/church-leaders-call-on-northern-ireland-politicians-to-make-courageous-decisions-in-2020-38825298.html"}
