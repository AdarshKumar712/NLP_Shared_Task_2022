political editor Annika Smethurst\u2019s home over spy story.\n\nThe ABC says a chilling Federal Court decision gives police the right to \u201center a newsroom and fossick around for confidential files\u201d.\n\nThe public broadcaster has failed in its legal bid to block federal police poring over documents collected in a controversial raid on the public broadcaster last year.\n\nABC News director Gaven Morris said the decision is a blow to democracy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the way public-interest journalism is able to be undertaken in this country is a mess,\u201d he told reporters outside the court in Sydney on Monday.\n\n\u201cI think fundamentally the court has ruled the AFP has the right to enter a newsroom and fossick around in confidential files.\n\n\u201cThis should send a chill down all our citizens\u2019 spines.\u201d\n\nThe Australian Federal Police raided the ABC\u2019s central Sydney offices last year following news reports in 2017 revealing Australian soldiers may have committed war crimes in Afghanistan.\n\nDubbed the \u201cAfghan Files\u201d, the stories were based on leaked Defence Department papers.\n\nThe broadcaster argued it was \u201clegally unreasonable\u201d for federal police to seek a warrant to search its head office and for a registrar to grant it.\n\nThe case was dismissed by Judge Wendy Abraham in Sydney on Monday morning, with the ABC also ordered to pay costs.\n\nIn her published judgment, she said the ABC had failed to prove the police search warrant was invalid.\n\n\u201cIn the event I am wrong and had I decided otherwise, I would not have ordered the material seized be returned to the (ABC),\u201d she wrote.\n\nABC managing director David Anderson said the AFP raid was an attempt to intimidate journalists.\n\n\u201cThis ruling highlights the serious problem with Australia\u2019s secrecy laws,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe ABC calls on the AFP to resolve this issue as a matter of urgency and drop its threat against our journalists.\u201d\n\nThe home of Herald Sun journalist Annika Smethurst was raided by federal police last year in relation to a 2018 story detailing a government proposal to spy on Australians.\n\n\u2013 With AAP", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["legal fight", "federal police", "legal bid", "Australian defence personnel", "AFP officers", "head
