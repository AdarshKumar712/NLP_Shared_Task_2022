If the divorce is dismissed, it would pave the way for one judge to rule on custody issues instead of the three who have been overseeing the probate, criminal and divorce cases.\n\nThe custody battle will be the subject of a hearing in Stamford juvenile court on Jan. 9 \u2014 the same day Fotis Dulos is scheduled to appear at the courthouse for his next pretrial hearing on the criminal charges related to his estranged wife\u2019s disappearance.\n\nRochlin said his client plans to seek access to the children when his appeal of the guardianship is heard next week.\n\nA Stamford family court judge had limited Fotis Dulos\u2019 access to his children prior to the May 24 disappearance. Fotis Dulos was allowed supervised visits with his children, the last of which occurred at his estranged wife\u2019s New Canaan home two days before she vanished.\n\nFotis Dulos has since been banned from all contact with his children as part of the conditions of his release on bail for charges of tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution in the disappearance.\n\nIn November, a New Canaan Probate Court judge granted Jennifer Dulos\u2019 mother, Gloria Farber, guardianship of the couple\u2019s five children. Farber, who has been granted the right to intervene in the divorce, has been caring for the children since the disappearance and is seeking permanent custody of them.\n\nIn his appeal motion, Rochlin accused Farber of violating state law by denying Fotis Dulos access to his children\u2019s medical and school records.\n\nRochlin said Farber has also denied Fotis Dulos\u2019 family members access to the children, \u201cdespite a long and positive history with these individuals.\u201d Fotis Dulos\u2019 sister and his niece recently sought to spend time with the children, but were denied, Rochlin said.\n\nFotis Dulos is also fighting his mother-in-law in civil court, where Farber has filed a $2.5 million lawsuit for business loans she said were not repaid to her family. Fotis Dulos has countered that the Farber family owes him $1 million. A two-day trial was held last month in Hartford and a Superior Court judge is expected to issue a ruling soon.\n\nFarber is also foreclosing on the Farmington home Fotis Dulos built in 2011. Jennifer and Fotis Dulos lived there until 2017 when she moved with the children to New Canaan and filed for divorce.\n\nJennifer Dulos was last seen on a neighbor\u2019s security camera returning to the Welles Lane home she had been renting around 8:05 a.m. May 24. According to arrest warrants, police believe Fotis Dulos was \u201clying in wait\u201d when she arrived home from dropping off their children at a nearby school.\n\nPolice said two people resembling Fotis Dulos and his former girlfriend Michelle Troconis were captured on video in Hartford later that night around the time Jennifer Dulos was reported missing. The man police contend is Fotis Dulos was seen on the videos dumping bags that were later determined to contain his wife\u2019s blood and clothing, the warrants said.\n\nA separate arrest warrant said Fotis Dulos and Troconis \u2014 who faces the same charges \u2014 also took a red Toyota Tacoma pickup truck belonging to a Fore Group employee to a car wash in the days after the disappearance. Police said in the warrant that they believe Fotis Dulos drove the truck to New Canaan the morning of the disappearance.\n\nFotis Dulos also urged the employee to remove the seats, which testing later revealed contained Jennifer Dulos\u2019 blood, according to the warrant.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["David Borges", "Emilie Munson", "Jeff Jacobs", "Jim Cameron", "Lisa Backus"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "ispremium": 0, "dc.date": "2020-01-01T05:00:00Z", "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T05:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T15:15:56Z", "opinion": "false"}, "SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "news_keywords": "Fotis Dulos, Jennifer Dulos, Richard Rochlin, Ruben Midler, Gloria Farber, Michelle Troconis, New Canaan, STAMFORD, Greece, Farber, Hartford, Welles Lane, Farmington, New Canaan Advertiser, New Canaan Probate Court, Superior Court, Fore Group, Toyota, Tacoma", "nlpOrganization": "New Canaan Advertiser, Farber, New Canaan Probate Court, Superior Court, Fore Group, Toyota", "nlpPerson": "Fotis Dulos, Jennifer Dulos, Richard Rochlin, Ruben Midler, Gloria Farber, Michelle Troconis", "nlpLocation": "New Canaan, STAMFORD, Greece, Farber, Hartford, Welles Lane, Farmington", "nlpCategories": "%2FLaw+%26+Government%2FLegal%2FLegal+Services", "og": {"title": "Jennifer Dulos\u2019 attorney wants Fotis to pay his legal fees", "description": "The missing New Canaan mother's lawyer responds to a motion to dismiss the contentious two-year divorce.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Jennifer-Dulos-attorney-wants-Fotis-to-pay-his-14943233.php", "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/07/51/77/18784238/33/rawImage.jpg", "site_name": "GreenwichTime"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@GreenwichTime"}, "fb": {"admins": 100006394927810, "app_id": 666270996736144, "pages": "105702905593,307851324523,12852567813,480760515417232,288240529145,316774245761,984197758297116,7457442370,207033189701,207346283795,222959748728,207042068180,72983690774,339413234035,343689323559,345828366626,234821559861394,335699426867,10150105039485602,338983127562,364516539001,337922332042,115637335153191,372011535931,333376634908,127590790608884,141923885872653,655037391286291,320774811368833,1740489152861748,469700473093040,386754203367,556449374478585,340999853450,350771491032,1120648627959218,342017778245,338463361591,138772706196968,1641688532739111,326312697536,353120110016,343366744658,335009494554,347261603104,350924013892,257724773860,361203926417,367174215398,284154645394,334501182354,350279743224,154340691263654,147848678611852,361381078011,362831597677,10150095255780118"}, "msvalidate.01": "9451CA04ABC9D1D5C6419C73B4C4F7B7"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Jennifer-Dulos-attorney-wants-Fotis-to-pay-his-14943233.php"}
