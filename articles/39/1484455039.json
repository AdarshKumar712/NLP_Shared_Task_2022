The air quality index (AQI) of Muzaffarpur remained \u2018severe\u2019 on Wednesday, whereas that of Patna was in \u2018very poor\u2019 category.According to the figures released by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI of Muzaffarpur was recorded at 465 on Wednesday, which was the worst in the country. Patna\u2019s AQI, on the other hand, was recorded at 365. Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) officials stated that the overall AQI of 365 for Patna was the average of AQI level at planetarium (439), BIT-Mesra, Patna (372), Eco Park (312) and SK Memorial Hall (321).BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh told this newspaper on Wednesday that the air quality of Patna and Muzaffarpur deteriorated because of three weather conditions \u2014 low wind velocity, increase in moisture level and decline in temperature. \u201cVehicle movement even at night on December 31 was another factor for the increase in AQI level at Patna and Muzaffarpur,\u201d he said.\u201cThe overall AQI level of the city has increased drastically. If we had only one air quality monitoring station at the planetarium, then Patna\u2019s AQI level could also have been in severe category,\u201d he added.The BSPCB chairman further said one more air quality station would soon come up at Muzaffarpur and another at Gaya. \u201cThe data of one monitoring station in a city is not sufficient at all. I personally think that at least four stations are needed in any city to get a broader scenario with regard to air pollution, but for bigger cities like Patna, 10 air monitoring stations are must,\u201d Ghosh said.BSPCB is, in fact, in the process of installing two more air quality monitoring stations near DRM office at Danapur and Government Boy\u2019s High School in Patna City by January 15.Pradhan Parth Sarthi, professor at Department of Environmental Science of Central University of South Bihar (CUSB), said weather factors like low wind velocity, foggy conditions and low temperature have led to thermal inversion phenomenon in the atmosphere, which, in turn, has trapped the suspended particulate matter in the lower level of atmosphere. \u201cThe conditions can improve only with northwesterly wind and rainfall,\u201d he added.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Patna news", "Patna latest news", "Patna news live", "Patna news today", "Today news Patna", "Patna air quality", "patna", "Muzaffarpur", "Gaya district", "danapur", "Bihar", "Air Quality Index"], "tags": ["Bangalore Temperature", "Delhi Smog", "Patna", "air quality index", "Mumbai Rains", "Hyderabad Rain", "GHMC Elections 2020", "Chennai Weather", "Srinagar encounter", "Fire in Mumbai", "Muzaffarpur", "Delhi Temperature", "Delhi Air Pollution", "Danapur"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The state capital and Muzaffarpur ushered in the New Year with very poor air quality.
