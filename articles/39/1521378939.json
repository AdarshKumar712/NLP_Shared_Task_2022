Azar, on behalf of himself and two of his colleagues on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, is significant in its own right. But it is also significant because it suggests that the Trump administration will have a tough time defending its conduct if this case is heard by the Supreme Court. Sentelle is one of archconservative Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s early mentors \u2014 Gorsuch clerked for Sentelle shortly after he graduated from law school. And Sentelle\u2019s views are well to the right of the median Supreme Court justice.\n\nSentelle is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the late Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC), a segregationist who thought so highly of Sentelle that he once said that he \u201cwould do whatever I could to make sure that this young man\u2019s integrity and talent, principles and courage, would be used by this country.\u201d As a judge, Sentelle joined an opinion complaining that the Supreme Court abandoned doctrines it once used to strike down labor protections such as the minimum wage.\n\nThe case involves an effort by the state of Arkansas to impose a work requirement on many Medicaid beneficiaries. Arkansas could not implement this policy on its own; it had to obtain permission from the federal government. And the Trump administration gave Arkansas the permission it sought.\n\nThe consequence of that decision, Sentelle writes, was that \u201cmore than 18,000 people (about 25 percent of those subject to the work requirement) lost coverage as a result of the project in just five months.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration cannot push Medicaid policies that run counter to Congress\u2019s stated objectives\n\nGresham turns on the scope of the federal government\u2019s power to approve experimental state programs that depart from the way Medicaid normally operates. The law permits the Department of Health and Human Services to approve \u201cany experimental, pilot, or demonstration project which, in the judgment of the Secretary, is likely to assist in promoting the objectives\u201d of Medicaid.\n\nBut those objectives were also defined by Congress. Among other things, the Medicaid statute states that the purpose of the program is to \u201cto furnish ... medical assistance on behalf of families with dependent children and of aged, blind, or disabled individuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.\u201d\n\nThe thrust of Sentelle\u2019s opinion in Gresham is that the Trump administration ignored this purpose, and tried to replace it with different objectives.\n\nTrump officials approved Arkansas\u2019s work requirements because it thought that these requirements would \u201caddress behavioral and social factors that influence health outcomes\u201d and encourage Medicaid beneficiaries to find work \u2014 something the Trump administration believes is \u201ccorrelated with improved health and wellness.\u201d\n\nBut even if the Trump administration is right that a work requirement will, in the long run, lead to better health outcomes, the law does not permit them to substitute their own opinions about how to improve poor people\u2019s health. As Sentelle writes, \u201cthe Supreme Court and this court have consistently reminded agencies that they are \u2018bound, not only by the ultimate purposes Congress has selected, but by the means it has deemed appropriate, and prescribed, for the pursuit of those purposes.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn this case, Congress decided that \u201cthe principal objective of Medicaid is providing health care coverage,\u201d not to encourage people to find jobs by making their health coverage contingent upon securing work.\n\nUnder Sentelle\u2019s opinion, the Trump administration could conceivably revive Arkansas\u2019s work requirement if it provided an adequate explanation of how that requirement would foster Medicaid\u2019s goal of expanding coverage to poor people. But given the fact that the requirement caused thousands of people to lose health coverage, it seems unlikely that the administration will clear that hurdle.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ian Millhiser", "Julia Belluz", "Nicole Narea", "Jen Kirby", "Allegra Frank", "Shirin Ghaffary", "Brian Resnick", "Feb"], "publish_date": "Fri Feb 14 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "When you\u2019ve lost David Sentelle ...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/community_logos/52517/voxv.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vox", "published_time": "2020-02-14T13:20:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-14T13:20:00-05:00"}, "author": "Ian Millhiser", "style-tools": "https://www.vox.com/style/community/441/b63260246bf960416d819324b64be21a/tools.css", "p": {"domain_verify": "d4410485bd6277c2bf2ce0f277819dc6"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "When you\u2019ve lost David Sentelle ...", "og": {"description": "When you\u2019ve lost David Sentelle ...", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OXr6ovYb-YVsnf-tJowMAeJ_4NY=/0x82:2650x1469/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19720359/74912280.jpg.jpg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Vox", "title": "Trump just got bad news from Neil Gorsuch\u2019s mentor in a big Medicaid case", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vox.com/2020/2/14/21137865/trump-medicaid-work-requirement-arkansas-david-sentelle-neil-gorsuch"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.vox.com/2020/2/14/21137865/trump-medicaid-work-requirement-arkansas-david-sentelle-neil-gorsuch", "title": "Trump just got bad news from Neil Gorsuch\u2019s mentor in a big Medicaid case", "description": "When you\u2019ve lost David Sentelle ...", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C5L6PcNsJCJR6SJp6qmy4584M_s=/0x113:2650x1438/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19720359/74912280.jpg.jpg", "site": "voxdotcom"}, "sailthru.title": "Trump just got bad news from Neil Gorsuch\u2019s mentor in a big Medicaid case", "sailthru.tags": "general,vox,front-page,health-care,policy-and-politics,scotus,category-commentary,category-news", "sailthru.description": "When you\u2019ve lost David Sentelle ...", "sailthru.date": "2020-02-14T13:20:00-05:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XhoBTS6-NGQBXBIkiYSfcMmWNX8=/0x30:2650x1521/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66314624/74912280.jpg.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fUWHbZjuYR8m4_pK3Q4go9NoII0=/247x0:2167x1920/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66314624/74912280.jpg.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/hub/sbnu_logo_minimal/441/touch_icon_ipad_retina_1000_yellow.755.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#4f7177", "outbrainsection": "category-commentary"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/2020/2/14/21137865/trump-medicaid-work-requirement-arkansas-david-sentelle-neil-gorsuch"}
