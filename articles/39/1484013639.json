(Touch the Sky with Glory!) and the air warrior 'flies like an eagle', the video states.\n\nThe clip contains footage of operations undertaken by the IAF in the past, and the background score heightens the patriotic content.\n\n'An IAF warrior dreams to born the same in the next life,' the narrator says at the end of the video, as an airman salutes a flying jet.\n\n'Indian Air Force wishes all a very Happy New Year 2020,' the IAF tweeted with the video.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["India News", "columns", "interviews", "news India", "breaking news"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "WATCH: IAF showcases past ops in New Year video.
