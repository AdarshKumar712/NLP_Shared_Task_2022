In the United States, only one radiologist reads the results and the tests are done every one to two years. In Britain, the tests are done every three years, and each is read by two radiologists. When they disagree, a third is consulted.\n\n'Subtle cues'\n\nIn a separate test, the group pitted the AI system against six radiologists and found it outperformed them at accurately detecting breast cancers.\n\nConnie Lehman, chief of the breast imaging department at Harvard's Massachusetts General Hospital, said the results are in line with findings from several groups using AI to improve cancer detection in mammograms, including her own work.\n\nThe notion of using computers to improve cancer diagnostics is decades old, and computer-aided detection (CAD) systems are commonplace in mammography clinics, yet CAD programs have not improved performance in clinical practice.\n\nThe issue, Lehman said, is that current CAD programmes were trained to identify things human radiologists can see, whereas with AI, computers learn to spot cancers based on the actual results of thousands of mammograms.\n\nThis has the potential to \u201cexceed human capacity to identify subtle cues that the human eye and brain aren't able to perceive,\u201d Lehman added.\n\nAlthough computers have not been \u201csuper helpful\u201d so far, \u201cwhat we've shown at least in tens of thousands of mammograms is the tool can actually make a very well-informed decision,\u201d Etemadi said.\n\nThe study has some limitations. Most of the tests were done using the same type of imaging equipment, and the US group contained a lot of patients with confirmed breast cancers.\n\nCrucially, the team has yet to show the tool improves patient care, said Dr Lisa Watanabe, chief medical officer of CureMetrix, whose AI mammogram program won US approval last year.\n\n\u201cAI software is only helpful if it actually moves the dial for the radiologist,\u201d she said.\n\nEtemadi agreed that those studies are needed, as is regulatory approval, a process that could take several years. \u2014 Reuters", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["breast cancer detection", "artificial intelligence helpful", "google system", "shows promise"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "CHICAGO, Jan 2 \u2014 A Google artificial intelligence system proved as good as expert radiologists at detecting which women had breast cancer based on screening mammograms and showed promise at reducing errors, researchers in the United States and Britain reported.
