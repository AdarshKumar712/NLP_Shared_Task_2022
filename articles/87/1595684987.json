Cabello said it was carried out by neighboring Colombia with United States backing in a plot to overthrow President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Both countries have repeatedly denied earlier Venezuelan allegations of backing for military plots against the socialist government.\n\n\u201cThose who assume they can attack the institutional framework in Venezuela will have to assume the consequences of their action,\" said Cabello, adding that one of the detained claimed to be an agent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nAuthorities said they found Peruvian documents, high-caliber weapons, satellite phones, uniforms and helmets adorned with the U.S. flag.\n\nInterior Minister Nestor Reverol described the attackers as \u201cmercenary terrorists\u201d bent on destabilizing Venezuela's institutions and creating \"chaos.\" Officials said the attack took place on a beach in La Guaira, about 20 miles from Caracas and home to the nation's largest airport.\n\nAuthorities say the attackers had vehicles and heavy arms waiting for them in the port city.\n\nVenezuela has been in a deepening political and economic crisis in recent years under Maduro's rule. Crumbling public services such as running water, electricity and medical care has driven nearly 5 million to migrate.\n\nA coalition of nearly 60 nations back opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader, saying Maduro's 2018 election was a sham because the most popular opposition candidates were banned from running.\n\nThe United States has led a campaign to oust Maduro, increasing pressure in recent weeks by indicting the socialist leader as a narcotrafficker and offering a $15 million reward for his arrest. The U.S. also has increased stiff sanctions, cutting off Venezuela's oil sector to choke Maduro from a key source of hard cash.\n\nIn addition to that pressure, Maduro\u2019s government has faced several small-scale military threats, including an attempt to assassinate Maduro with a drone and Guaid\u00f3\u2019s call for a military uprising, which was joined by few soldiers.\n\nMaduro and his allies say the Trump administration is determined to end Venezuela\u2019s socialist government to exploit the South American nation\u2019s vast underground oil reserves.\n\nThe Associated Press reported on Friday that an apparently ill-funded attempt to amass an invasion force of 300 men in Colombia involving a former Venezuelan military officer and an ex-Green Beret, suffered setbacks in March when a main organizer was arrested, an arms cache was seized and some participants abandoned its camps.\n\nCabello linked Sunday's attack to key players in that alleged plot.\n\nMeanwhile, Cesar Omana, a businessman who participated in an unsuccessful plot against Maduro a year ago, said some 30 armed commandos from the Sebin intelligence police raided his Caracas home early Sunday. Omana is not in the country.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Joshua Goodman contributed to this report from Miami, Florida.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Scott Smith", "Associlated Press"], "publish_date": "Sun May  3 09:27:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "ispremium": 0, "dc.date": "2020-05-03T16:26:18Z", "article": {"published_time": "2020-05-03T16:26:18Z", "modified_time": "2020-05-03T16:27:04Z", "opinion": "false"}, "SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "news_keywords": "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Diosdado Cabello, Nestor Reverol, Juan Guaid\u00f3, Caribbean Colombia Caracas, Joshua Goodman, Cesar Omana, Trump, Venezuela, United States, Colombia, North America Venezuela South America Latin America, Latin America, CARACAS, Peruvian, La Guaira, South American, Miami, Florida, AP, MC Complete - State & National, Caribbean News, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Socialist, ___ Associated Press, Sebin, A Wire, News - International - Stories, Top News, Choice Plus, ex-Green Beret", "nlpOrganization": "AP, MC Complete - State & National, Caribbean News, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Socialist, ___ Associated Press, Sebin", "nlpPerson": "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Diosdado Cabello, Nestor Reverol, Juan Guaid\u00f3, Caribbean Colombia Caracas, Joshua Goodman, Cesar Omana, Trump", "nlpLocation": "Venezuela, United States, Colombia, North America Venezuela South America Latin America, Latin America, CARACAS, Peruvian, La Guaira, South American, Miami, Florida", "nlpWorkOfArt": "A Wire, News - International - Stories", "nlpOther": "Choice Plus, ex-Green Beret", "nlpCategories": "%2FNews,%2FBusiness+%26+Industrial", "sailthru.title": "Venezuela says it foiled attack by boat on main port city", "sailthru.date": "2020-05-03 9:27:00 -0700", "sailthru.author": "By SCOTT SMITH, Associlated Press", "sailthru_uid": 15243261, "sailthru_pubname": "associated-press", "sailthru_siteid": 19, "sailthru.tags": "nicol-s-maduro,diosdado-cabello,nestor-reverol,juan-guaid,caribbean-colombia-caracas,joshua-goodman,cesar-omana,trump,venezuela,united-states,colombia,north-america-venezuela-south-america-latin-america,latin-america,caracas,peruvian,la-guaira,south-american,miami,florida,ap,mc-complete-state-national,caribbean-news,u-s-drug-enforcement-administration,socialist,associated-press,sebin,a-wire,news-international-stories,top-news,choice-plus,ex-green-beret,ap,mc-complete-state-national,caribbean-news,u-s-drug-enforcement-administration,socialist,associated-press,sebin,nicol-s-maduro,diosdado-cabello,nestor-reverol,juan-guaid,caribbean-colombia-caracas,joshua-goodman,cesar-omana,trump,venezuela,united-states,colombia,north-america-venezuela-south-america-latin-america,latin-america,caracas,peruvian,la-guaira,south-american,miami,florida,a-wire,news-international-stories,choice-plus,ex-green-beret,2fnews,2fbusiness-26-industrial", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/11/70/70/19369527/7/sailthruImage.jpg", "og": {"title": "Venezuela says it foiled attack by boat on main port city", "description": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) - Venezuelan officials said they foiled an early morning attempt by a group of armed men to invade the country by boat on Sunday, killing eight attackers and arresting two more. \n Socialist party chief Diosdado Cabello said that two of the attackers were being interrogated by authorities.
