The Macalope\u2019s not going to weigh in on whether or not a decade runs from 0 to 9 or 1 to 10. This is a technology column, he doesn\u2019t get into religion.\n\nRegardless, a lot of people are looking back on the decade of Apple news and taking stock of what were the big events and products of the last ten years that are at least an elapsed decade whether or not they are a canonical decade.\n\nWhich, if The Macalope knows his terminology, is a decade that you can fire out of a cannon. Just checking his notes and\u2026 yes, it can be any cannon. Military, shirt, confetti, what have you.\n\nWhat were we talking about?\n\nOh, right. The last decade of Apple.\n\nWe sure got into a lot of dumb arguments, didn\u2019t we? Is market share the most important thing ever or is it of some kind of uber-importance that cannot be measured by our universe\u2019s science? Is the iPad a computer or just a sandwich? How big of a flop is the Apple Watch? And how devastating are those yearly iPhone production cuts that happen every year after the big launch but, ZOMG, this year they\u2019re cutting production?!\n\nBy the way, that is the last time The Macalope is legally allowed to use \u201cZOMG\u201d. Yep, it\u2019s been deprecated as of 2020. Some would say as of 2012. Anyway, it had a good run.\n\nHere\u2019s a question from the last 10 years that no one followed up on: did anyone ever get wrist cancer from the Apple Watch? That\u2019s one The Macalope thinks about from time to time. At least Apple eventually shipped the cancer-causing Apple Watch after \u201cdisappearing\u201d for a while in mid-2014 by failing to ship something in the wearables category that was vastly important in the mid-2010s but now that Apple owns it, no one talks about it anymore.\n\nThe Macalope could go on and on about this. Seriously, he even has an interpretive dance about all the dumb things people said about Apple in the 2010s. It was very well reviewed in Dumb Dance Quarterly.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t want to leave the year and the decade on such a sour note. Instead, in the spirit of reaching across the aisle, he\u2019d like to point to this piece by Antonio Villas-Boas at none other than Business Insider where Villas-Boas lays out his reasons for using Android and Windows without committing the crimes of claiming that it must be so for everyone if it is so for him and that Apple can do no good.\n\nSure, he drops a soup\u00e7on of \u201cwalled garden\u201d-style references, but it\u2019s not like The Macalope doesn\u2019t use a garbage truck of \u201ccess pool of malware\u201d references when talking about Android.\n\n(The cess pool really is the worst kind of pool, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s not even a contest.)\n\nThe Macalope doesn\u2019t care what platform people choose. Choose the right one for you. There are very good reasons to use Android over iOS and Windows over the Mac. Villas-Boas values hardware choice, and that\u2019s a completely valid reason to not use Apple products. Just stop trying to tell us Apple platforms suck and the company is going out of business any day. Despite the company\u2019s ridiculous level of success in the 2010s, that didn\u2019t happen. Something to aspire to in the 2020s.\n\nNot that The Macalope is saying that\u2019s a canonical decade.\n\nJust to be clear. The horny one\u2019s not in the pocket of Big Decade.
