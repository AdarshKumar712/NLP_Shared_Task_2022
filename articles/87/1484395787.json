I practised daily both in the morning as well as evening in my farm for months together. I clinched the top spot throwing a five and a half kg iron ball in the Khel Mahakumbh,\" gushed Rambhi, a resident of Parawada village, some 35 km from Porbandar Apart from shot put, Rambhi also learned discus throwing again from the videos. While she had won the second prize in discus throw in 2017 Khel Mahakumbh, she stood third in the game in 2018 and also bagged the first and second prize at the university-level competitions in the same sports.\"I am proud of my daughter. She has been interested in sports, especially, discus throw and shot put, since her childhood. I have always encouraged her in sports. I am glad that an event like Khel Mahakumbh has recognized her achievements,\" said Rambhi's father, Devsi Seeda.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Rajkot news", "Rajkot latest news", "Rajkot news live", "Rajkot news today", "Today news Rajkot", "rakjkot news", "porbandar girl", "Porbandar", "newsof gujarat", "news of rajkot", "Gujarat news"], "tags": ["Mumbai Rains", "Chennai Rains", "Delhi Pollution", "Mumbai Floods", "Srinagar encounter", "Bangalore Rains", "Porbandar", "Delhi Earthquake", "Madras High Court"], "authors": ["Tnn", "Updated", "Jan"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "She has proven that Ekalavya is not merely a mythical character defining exemplary discipleship - 21-year-old Rambhi Seeda has shown it in her own li", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "She has proven that Ekalavya is not merely a mythical character defining exemplary discipleship - 21-year-old Rambhi Seeda has shown it in her own li", "keywords": "Rajkot news, Rajkot latest news, Rajkot news live, Rajkot news today, Today news Rajkot,rakjkot news,porbandar girl,Porbandar,newsof gujarat,news of rajkot,Gujarat news", "og": {"title": "Gujarat: Self-taught Porbandar girl wins first prize in shot put | Rajkot News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/gujarat-self-taught-porbandar-girl-wins-first-prize-in-shot-put/articleshow/73063875.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063934,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-184378,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "She has proven that Ekalavya is not merely a mythical character defining exemplary discipleship - 21-year-old Rambhi Seeda has shown it in her own li", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/gujarat-self-taught-porbandar-girl-wins-first-prize-in-shot-put/articleshow/73063875.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063934,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-184378,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "Gujarat: Self-taught Porbandar girl wins first prize in shot put | Rajkot News - Times of India", "description": "She has proven that Ekalavya is not merely a mythical character defining exemplary discipleship - 21-year-old Rambhi Seeda has shown it in her own li", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/gujarat-self-taught-porbandar-girl-wins-first-prize-in-shot-put/articleshow/73063875.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 26781952138, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0", "robots": "NOODP"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/gujarat-self-taught-porbandar-girl-wins-first-prize-in-shot-put/articleshow/73063875.cms"}
