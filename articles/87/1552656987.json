Next key support for the aussie is seen around the 0.54 level.\n\n\n\nThe aussie fell to an 11-year low of 59.87 against the yen from Wednesday's closing value of 62.33. The aussie is seen finding support around the 58.00 mark.\n\n\n\nData from the ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications showed that overall nationwide consumer prices in Japan were up 0.4 percent on year in February.\n\n\n\nThat was shy of expectations for an increase of 0.5 percent and was down from 0.7 percent in January.\n\n\n\nThe aussie depreciated to an 11-year low of 1.9799 against the euro from yesterday's closing quote of 1.8900. The aussie is likely to challenge support around the 2.00 region, if it drops again.\n\n\n\nThe aussie retreated to 1.0021 against the kiwi, from a 3-day high of 1.0160 seen at 8:45 pm ET. The next possible support for the aussie is seen around the 0.99 level.\n\n\n\nData from Statistics New Zealand showed that New Zealand's gross domestic product expanded a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\n\n\nThat matched expectations and was down from the upwardly revised 0.8 percent gain in the three months prior.\n\n\n\nThe aussie slipped to an 11-year low of 0.8066 against the loonie, compared to 0.8378 hit late New York Wednesday. Further decline may see the aussie facing support around the 0.81 level.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, at 3:00 am ET, Swiss trade data for February will be out.\n\n\n\nThe Swiss National Bank's interest rate decision is due at 4:30 am ET. Economists expect the policy rate to remain unchanged at -0.75 percent.\n\n\n\nEurozone construction output for January is scheduled for release in the European session.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. weekly jobless claims for the week ended March 14 and leading index for February will be featured in the New York session.\n\n\n\nCopyright RTT News/dpa-AFX", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Australian", "Dollar", "Drops", "Amid", "Risk", "Aversion", "Growing", "Coronavirus", "Fears"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Afx News"], "publish_date": "Wed Mar  4 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "CANBERA (dpa-AFX) - The Australian dollar lost ground against its key counterparts during the Asian session on Thursday, as Asian stock markets slipped into negative territory despite the European", "meta_lang": "de", "meta_favicon": "https://fns1.de/g/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Australian, Dollar, Drops, Amid, Risk, Aversion, Growing, Coronavirus, Fears", "description": "CANBERA (dpa-AFX) - The Australian dollar lost ground against its key counterparts during the Asian session on Thursday, as Asian stock markets slipped into negative territory despite the European", "robots": "noodp,index,follow", "og": {"title": "Australian Dollar Drops Amid Risk Aversion On Growing Coronavirus Fears", "url": "https://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2020-03/49146012-australian-dollar-drops-amid-risk-aversion-on-growing-coronavirus-fears-020.htm", "site_name": "FinanzNachrichten.de", "image": "https://fns1.de/g/fb.png", "type": "article", "description": "CANBERA (dpa-AFX) - The Australian dollar lost ground against its key counterparts during the Asian session on Thursday, as Asian stock markets slipped into negative territory despite the European"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001851463444}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=576714727", "google-play-app": "app-id=de.finanznachrichten.app", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2020-03/49146012-australian-dollar-drops-amid-risk-aversion-on-growing-coronavirus-fears-020.htm"}
