Post the discovery of the alleged fraud, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the depositories and exchanges have placed a ban on Karvy.\n\nTheir reactionary action has managed to somewhat stem the agony of the firm\u2019s retail clients. But still, the whole episode has raised several questions on the failure of these institutions to spot the malaise early. How did Karvy manage to hoodwink all of them to carry on a clandestine activity?\n\nNot surprisingly, these shenanigans have raised the pitch for refreshing the regulatory framework, especially relating to stockbroking and depository participants.\n\nMuch water has flown under the bridge since India\u2019s regional stock exchanges passed into the pages of history and the National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchanges became the de facto kings. Member-brokers of the regional exchanges have either turned members of the NSE and BSE or have become sub-brokers or authorised persons of existing members.\n\nWatch: Karvy Broking Scandal Explained: Unethical Pledging of Client Securities?\n\nThe broking business also has undergone a major metamorphosis. Today, it has problems aplenty. An uncertain market, discount practices, online trading and a maze of rules and the like have all posed a challenge of their own. In the bargain, it has given rise to avoidable practices. All these have combined to put the present regulatory framework at a risk.\n\nThe current framework, it is argued, is under increasing stress, what with one too many players in the field. Given this, a view is gaining increasing ground that the existing regulatory and supervision mechanism needs to be revisited sooner than later. If consolidation is seen as the cure for many ills in the banking industry, why not this course be adopted in the broking arena as well? After all, consolidation gives a player the required bandwidth to absorb rising costs in an increasingly compliance-driven era.\n\nThe Karvy case indeed reiterates the need to conduct a \u2018fit and proper test\u2019 on all broking houses. Like non-banking finance companies, brokerage houses too be categorised based on their membership with exchanges and ranked according to their service offer. If the discounting in the automobile industry is bad, nil brokerage in the stock business too is undesirable and must be banned as it has the potential to trigger not-so-healthy practices.\n\nSince the Karvy episode is allegedly caused by promoter-induced shenanigans, it is time the responsibility was fixed by forcing them to have a minimum holding in the company. At the same time, the management and owners should be kept at a distance by having a majority of directors who aren\u2019t loyal to the promoters on the board of the company. Simultaneously, adequate financial barrier in terms of a minimum net worth could help keep the non-serious players out of the field. From a client-protection angle, it will be well served if only public limited companies are allowed in the business.\n\nWhile enforcing strict restrictions on off-market deals, the authorities will do well to encourage via suitable mechanism to force institutional business through the members of the stock exchanges. Market is extremely dynamic. And, it requires a proactive regulatory and supervisory regime. Karvy has indeed exposed an inadequate and under-equipped system.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["broking regulation", "BSE", "karvy", "karvy broking scandal", "Karvy Stock Broking", "karvy stockbroking", "Latest headlines", "latest news", "News", "NSE", "stock broking", "stock broking scandal", "stockbroking", "stockbroking regulation", "top headlines", "Top News", "top stories", "what is karvy scandal"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The sordid episode makes us wonder whether there is a need to conduct a 'fit and proper test' on all broking houses", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/13013510/fav-icon.gif", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The sordid episode makes us wonder whether there is a need to conduct a 'fit and proper test' on all broking houses", "keywords": "broking regulation,BSE,karvy,karvy broking scandal,Karvy Stock Broking,karvy stockbroking,Latest headlines,latest news,News,NSE,stock broking,stock broking scandal,stockbroking,stockbroking regulation,top headlines,Top News,top stories,what is karvy scandal", "twitter": {"url": "https://thewire.in/business/karvy-fraud-stockbroking-rules", "title": "Karvy Fall-Out Demands That We Re-Write the Rules of the Game", "image": "https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/01123603/karvy-800x400.jpg", "description": "The sordid episode makes us wonder whether there is a need to conduct a 'fit and proper test' on all broking houses", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thewire_in"}, "og": {"title": "Karvy Fall-Out Demands That We Re-Write the Rules of the Game", "url": "https://thewire.in/business/karvy-fraud-stockbroking-rules", "image": "https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/01123603/karvy-800x400.jpg", "description": "The sordid episode makes us wonder whether there is a need to conduct a 'fit and proper test' on all broking houses", "site_name": "The Wire"}, "fb": {"pages": 796133113794354, "page_id": 796133113794354, "app_id": 148755725703053}, "google-site-verification": "qmA_axOzAzHlhojAFfRJ6mwdIts2MMXkrZXHy5VnnvU"}, "canonical_link": "https://thewire.in/business/karvy-fraud-stockbroking-rules"}
