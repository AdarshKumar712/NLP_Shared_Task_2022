He isn\u2019t the franchise star like Blake Griffin once was in Los Angeles, but he is a solid piece that helped lead the Pistons to playoff appearances in 2016 and 2019.\n\nAcquiring Reggie Jackson was a key element for both playoff runs as he was healthy for the full season. Trading for Griffin essentially willed the Pistons to the 2019 playoffs, battling through a torn meniscus late in the season and grinding through the final three weeks and two playoff games.\n\nBut bad draft pick after bad draft pick led to an underwhelming decade for the Pistons, which their fans hope to have success like the 2000s when the Goin\u2019 to Work Pistons captured a new generation of fans\u2019 hearts.\n\nFortunately the draft is turning at the right time. Luke Kennard was a solid selection and Bruce Brown has proven to be a gem found in the second round. The 2019 selection of Sekou Doumbouya provides hope for a better decade in the 2020s.\n\nDwane Casey, Ed Stefanski and Co. are in their second year in Detroit, looking to build and develop young talent. The Pistons enter 2020 with an average age of 22.2, including the two-way players of Jordan Bone and Louis King. Looking on a macro level, there\u2019s plenty to look forward to.\n\nBut let\u2019s take one last look back at the 2010s. Here\u2019s what our staff compiled to review.\n\nWe look forward to the 2020s and are grateful that you are a part of what makes Piston Powered a great community.
