The construction of the said State Secretariat Phase II was actually commenced and it was at superstructure level before same was abandoned,\u201d Director General of the Bureau of Land Ibrahim Salman said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe entire land was later redesigned in the 1980s for the construction of a Civil Service Clinic, State Secretariat, and a parking lot for both the Clinic and the State Secretariat.\n\n\u201cThe Clinic was subsequently constructed in 1982, while the remaining plots of land were conceived for the expansion of the Clinic into a full-fledged Hospital.\n\n\u201cThe dream of the State Government was stalled when part of the land slated for the parking lot was spuriously allocated in principle to one Asa Investment for commercial purpose.\n\n\u201cFrom available records, the allocation was not based on a formal application, nor application forms filled; there was no evidence of payment for the said allocation as stipulated in the letter of allocation in principle and consequently, no right of occupancy was ever issued to the Company.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in flagrant abuse of the allocation terms, the company took possession of the land and constructed what is today known as \u2018Ile Arugbo\u2019 on part of the land that was designed as parking lot and later conceived to host the expansion of the Civil Service Clinic into a full-fledged Hospital.\n\nSalman added: \u201cFollowing a resolution of the Kwara State House of Assembly mandating him to revoke/withdraw the spurious allocation, Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq recently signed an instrument to reclaim the land on the ground that same was unlawfully allocated to a private Company contrary to the public purpose of its acquisition and occupied in breach of the terms of allocation.\n\n\u201cThis (press) release is intended to state the facts on the land recently revoked/withdrawn by the state government as contained in our records.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Ibrahim Salman", "Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq", "Kwara State Bureau of Lands", "Abubakar Olusola Saraki", "Ile Arugbo", "Abubakar Bukola Saraki", "Kwara State Government"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 14:39:08 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/TEO-icon-55x55.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "theme-color": "#cc0000", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#cc0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "#cc0000", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kwara gives more details on Saraki\u2019s seized land amid protest by old women + Videos", "site_name": "The Eagle Online", "description": "The Kwara State\u2019s Bureau of Lands on Wednesday revealed further details surrounding the Civil Service Clinic land and its adjourning", "url": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/kwara-gives-more-details-on-sarakis-seized-land-amid-protest-by-old-women-videos/", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Kwara-State-Government-e1540629560677.png", "height": 323, "width": 600}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T14:39:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T14:39:08+00:00", "section": "Featured", "tag": "Kwara State Government"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kwara gives more details on Saraki\u2019s seized land amid protest by old women + Videos", "description": "The Kwara State\u2019s Bureau of Lands on Wednesday revealed further details surrounding the Civil Service Clinic land and its adjourning", "url": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/kwara-gives-more-details-on-sarakis-seized-land-amid-protest-by-old-women-videos/", "image": {"src": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Kwara-State-Government-e1540629560677.png", "width": 600, "height": 323}}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "fb": {"pages": 245777418823519}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/TEO-icon.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng"}
