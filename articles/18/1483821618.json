Eight people were taken hostage and one person was injured during the strike.\n\nArmed men seized a Greek oil tanker just outside the Cameroonian port of Limbe, Greek authorities said on Tuesday.\n\nEight people were abducted and one person -- a Greek national -- was injured.\n\nThe five Greeks, two Filipinos and a Ukrainian were part of a 28-member crew aboard the Happy Lady.\n\nThe vessel was 2 nautical miles (3.7 kilometers) off Limbe port when it was raided overnight into Tuesday.\n\nGreece's state-run AMNA news agency said the government was closely monitoring the situation.\n\nAttacks on ships and kidnappings for ransom are relatively frequent along the West African coast.\n\nPirates hijack ships sometimes for several days as they pillage their cargo while demanding hefty ransoms in return for the release of the crew.\n\nArmed men raided another Greek oil tanker, the Elka Aristote, in November around 10 nautical miles off the Togolese capital Lome, capturing four sailors.\n\nThey released three of the men on December 13, but one died in captivity.\n\nmm/aw (AFP, Reuters)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Africa", "news", "politics", "economy", "trade", "business", "sports", "current events", "travel", "Cameroon", "West Africa", "Economy", "Business and Finance", "Legal and Judicial Affairs", "External Relations", "Transport and Shipping", "Petroleum", "Europe and Africa", "Central Africa"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 08:24:08 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A Greek registered tanker has been attacked by armed men close to a port in Cameroon.
