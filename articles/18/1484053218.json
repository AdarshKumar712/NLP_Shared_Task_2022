A crowd-pleasing horror adventure with a big, emotional heart. A box office smash, grossing $340 million worldwide on a $17 million budget. A critical darling that used its high concept to tremendous effect. A reminder that Emily Blunt is the profoundly talented leading lady we don\u2019t deserve. And perhaps most surprisingly, evidence that John Krasinski has some serious chops as a filmmaker and that \u201cJim from The Office\u201d made one of the strongest genre films of the decade and probably shouldn\u2019t be referred to as \u201cJim from The Office\u201d any longer.\n\nBut that means A Quiet Place Part II has a lot to live up to now. Can the story of a family struggling to stay together in a post-apocalyptic landscape filled with monsters with ultra-sensitive hearing continue to prove surprising and terrifying and moving? We shall see, but the first proper trailer for the sequel certainly suggests yes.\n\nA Quiet Place Part II Trailer\n\nThe sequel appears to take place shortly after the events of the first film, with the characters played by Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe venturing away from their formerly safe compound with a newborn baby in tow. While Krasinski is back behind the camera, the fact that his character is extremely dead keeps him from joining that particular journey (although some intense flashback scenes in the trailer suggest he could be back in some capacity). However, with this being a story about the end of the world, the family soon encounters a few survivors who pose that big question: who is the real monster here?\n\nThat question is familiar territory for a movie like this, but after the first film, I\u2019m willing to give Krasinski (who has sole screenwriting credit on this one), the benefit of the doubt. Plus, those new survivors include characters played by Cillian Murphy and Djimon Hounsou, two actors who always offer something interesting.\n\nMeanwhile, the brand new official synopsis doesn\u2019t offer us anything that the the trailer doesn\u2019t already suggest:\n\nFollowing the deadly events at home, the Abbott family (Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, Noah Jupe) must now face the terrors of the outside world as they continue their fight for survival in silence. Forced to venture into the unknown, they quickly realize that the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats that lurk beyond the sand path.\n\nA Quiet Place Part II quietly slips into theaters on March 20, 2020.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["A Quiet Place Part II", "A Quiet Place"], "authors": ["Jacob Hall"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 07:15:12 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The first full A Quiet Place Part II trailer brings us back to the post-apocalyptic landscape where one loud noise can mean certain death.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/slashfilm/siteimages/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 254451208349115}, "description": "The first full A Quiet Place Part II trailer brings us back to the post-apocalyptic landscape where one loud noise can mean certain death.", "news_keywords": "a quiet place, a quiet place part ii, movies, film, tv", "original-source": "https://www.slashfilm.com/a-quiet-place-part-ii-trailer/", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'A Quiet Place Part II' Trailer: The Sequel to the 2018 Hit Certainly Looks Intense", "description": "The first full A Quiet Place Part II trailer brings us back to the post-apocalyptic landscape where one loud noise can mean certain death.", "url": "https://www.slashfilm.com/a-quiet-place-part-ii-trailer/", "site_name": "/Film", "image": {"identifier": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/A-Quiet-Place-Part-II-Trailer.jpg", "secure_url": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/A-Quiet-Place-Part-II-Trailer.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 287}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/slashfilm", "tag": "A Quiet Place Part II", "section": "Paramount Pictures", "published_time": "2020-01-01T07:15:12-08:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The first full A Quiet Place Part II trailer brings us back to the post-apocalyptic landscape where one loud noise can mean certain death.", "title": "'A Quiet Place Part II' Trailer: The Sequel to the 2018 Hit Certainly Looks Intense", "site": "@slashfilm", "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/A-Quiet-Place-Part-II-Trailer.jpg", "creator": "@slashfilm"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-270x270.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.slashfilm.com/a-quiet-place-part-ii-trailer/"}
