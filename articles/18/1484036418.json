That was the number one sentence, 'denuclearisation', that was done in Singapore. I think he's a man of his word,\" a tuxedo-wearing Mr Trump told reporters before heading into New Year festivities at his holiday retreat in Florida.\n\nIn Florida Mr Trump repeated his previous comments that he and Kim \"like\" each other and have a very good relationship.\n\n\"He is representing his country. We will do what we have to do,\" he added.\n\nHopes had been raised further when the two men met at the demilitarised zone (DMZ) which divides North and South Korea at the end of June.\n\nThe US president maintained that the suspension of nuclear tests was evidence that his approach had succeeded where others had failed and that Kim could be persuaded to give up his nuclear arsenal.\n\nIn Washington officials had sought to play down the threat from Pyongyang, despite the increasingly aggressive noises coming from North Korea.\n\nBut in recent months relations have worsened and the North Korean leader struck a harsh note at the meeting of the ruling Workers Party.\n\n\"The US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude,\" KCNA cited him as saying.\n\n\"We can never sell our dignity,\" he added, saying Pyongyang would \"shift to a shocking actual action to make (the US) pay for the pains sustained by our people\".\n\nKim added that \"if the US persists in its hostile policy toward the DPRK, there will never be the denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula and the DPRK will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy,\" according to the agency.\n\nKim and President Donald Trump have met three times since June 2018, but negotiations have faltered since the collapse of their second summit last February in Vietnam.\n\nThe North announced in December that it performed two \"crucial\" tests at its long-range rocket launch site that would further strengthen its nuclear deterrent, prompting speculation that it was developing an ICBM or planning a satellite launch that would provide an opportunity to advance its missile technologies.\n\nNorth Korea also last year ended a 17-month pause in ballistic activity by testing a slew of solid-fuel weapons that potentially expanded its capabilities to strike targets in South Korea and Japan, including U.S. military bases there.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["David Millward"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 02:58:59 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "North Korea is to abandon its moratorium on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, Kim Jong-un has announced.
