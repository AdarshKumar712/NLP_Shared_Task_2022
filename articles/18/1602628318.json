We have setup the Cross vCenter vMotion utility and migrated a VM to the new site as a test. Unfortunately because of the way our network was setup some time ago we have sites that need to have their network equipment upgraded before they can communicate with the new site - so once the migration completes for a VM those site will not longer be able to access it, not to mention our bandwidth is terrible.\n\nWe would like to have the ability to clone the VMs to the new site (while powered on) to basically \"seed\" the site and then have changes synced. Once all the VMs are synced and those sites have been upgraded then we can complete the transition (DNS changes).\n\nIs this sort of thing possible?\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Hello,  We are preparing to move our environment to a new facility where we have installed a similar vCenter environment to our current one to where there", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=0, initial-scale=1.0", "titleEscaped": "true", "description": "Hello,  We are preparing to move our environment to a new facility where we have installed a similar vCenter environment to our current one to where there"}, "canonical_link": "https://communities.vmware.com/thread/633367"}
