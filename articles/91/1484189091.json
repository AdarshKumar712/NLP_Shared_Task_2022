Rabbi Sabag answered - \"The Kingdom of Morocco, as the Lubavitcher Rebbe said, is a 'kingdom of grace' and when I say 'kingdom of grace' is literally 'kingdom of grace.' So far, with G-d's blessing, the king is good to the Jews.\"\n\nRabbi Sabag told a story from World War II when the King of Morocco did not want to give the list of Jews in Morocco to Adolf Hitler. \"One of the things he said was 'If you want to give them (the Jews) a yellow badge, then add some [badges] for the royal family.'\"\n\nJews all over the world today are facing anti-Semitism, what is your situation?\n\n\"There is anti-Semitism all over the world, but with us, thankfully, we have not reached such situations,\" Rabbi Dr. Sabag said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"Description": "Moroccan Rabbi describes tolerance enjoyed by Jewish community of Morocco.
