Sheffield have netted 23 goals this season, and in the top half, only Crystal Palace (18) have scored fewer.\n\nAgainst a Liverpool side that has kept four consecutive clean sheets in the league, that could be an issue.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Soccer", "World Football", "Premier League", "Liverpool", "Breaking News", "Gevorg Hovhannisyan", "Arman Tadevosyan", "Christian Ramsebner"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Christopher Simpson"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Liverpool  will look to maintain their march toward the Premier League title on Thursday as they host Sheffield United at Anfield.
