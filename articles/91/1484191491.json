I\u2019m going to cry,\u201d she said as she wrapped up her last shift at Surrey Memorial Hospital.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to go. I\u2019ve had a great run for 44 years, great experiences.\u201d\n\nEhbrecht began her career at the old Grace Hospital, now known as B.C. Women\u2019s Hospital.\n\n\u201cThe head nurse that I had initially was like an army head nurse,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt was important to bounce dimes on the beds and the bed-making was really an important part of my job.\u201d\n\nHer expertise in bed-making is rivalled only by the depth of her knowledge of the maternity unit, having cared for thousands of families over the years as they welcomed the newest members of their families.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n2:20 GTA mother searches for Vancouver nurse who helped save her GTA mother searches for Vancouver nurse who helped save her\n\nShe says one of the biggest changes she has seen during his career is the switch to single-care rooms for new moms.\n\n\u201cI loved the single-room philosophy at Women\u2019s,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI worked in their unit when it started. There was a lot of controversy because it was a new thing. Women can come in, families can come in. They labour, deliver, they have their postpartum in the same room.\n\n\u201cThis is such a much better model of care \u2014 yeah, happy little thing.\u201d\n\nHer final shift was filled with heartfelt goodbyes from colleagues who will miss her \u2014 and she says she will miss them, too.\n\n\u201cI work with some great people, great doctors, great nurses,\u201d she said.\n\nNurses will continue to deliver up to 400 babies a month. It\u2019s the part of the job that Ehbrecht says she\u2019ll remember most.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a privilege and an honour to be with a family when they\u2019re experiencing that labour and delivery,\u201d Ehbrecht said.\n\n\u201cI just feel so honoured that I could be a part of it.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["BC nurse retires", "44-year career", "B.C.
