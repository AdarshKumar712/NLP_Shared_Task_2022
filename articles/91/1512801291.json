On the same day the ABC reality show featured a date in which contestant Victoria Fuller won the opportunity to pose for the iconic magazine alongside leading man Peter Weber, the magazine announced the cover has been pulled due to Fuller\u2019s past association with the \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d slogan.\n\nVictoria, 26, was expected to grace the cover of the magazine\u2019s next digital issue, but Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Jessica Pels released a statement denouncing the model\u2019s controversial past.\n\n\u201cUnequivocally, the White Lives Matter movement does not reflect the values of the Cosmo brand,\u201d Pels said, per People. \u201cWe stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter, and any cause that fights to end injustices for people of color.\u201d\n\nPels went on to explain that when the Cosmopolitan team flew down to Costa Rica for The Bachelor date challenge, they did not meet any of the potential models until they were ready to shoot. The editor-in-chief explained that she only knew Victoria\u2019s first name and nothing about her past when she chose the winner of the digital Cosmo cover.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until a few weeks ago that I found out that the woman I\u2019d chosen had, in her past, modeled in an ad campaign wearing White Lives Matter attire,\u201d Pels explained in her statement.\n\nAfter long discussions regarding the situation, the magazine decided to drop plans for Victoria\u2019s cover on the brand\u2019s website and social media feeds. Photos from The Bachelor fashion shoot have already been printed for Cosmo\u2019s March issue, complete with an inset of the questionable cover, and some photos from the shoot appear on the magazine\u2019s website with the headline \u201cWe Spent the Day with Pilot Pete In Costa Rica.\u201d\n\nPeople notes that Victoria once modeled for a White Marlin Marina ad campaign titled \u201cMarlin Lives Matter\u201d in regards to endangered fish species. The \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d slogan was reportedly used to promote the conservation of white marlin. \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d messaging was also used on promotional shirts and hats, in reference to blue marlin.\n\nThe ABC reality star has not yet publicly commented on the controversy about her past modeling shoot, not have Bachelor producers, but fans of the show have praised Cosmo for pulling the cover.\n\n\u201cHappy to see Cosmpolitan taking an ethical stand against bigoted Bachelor contestant Victoria Fuller. No one who models for a White Lives Matter campaign deserves any kind of platform; it\u2019s a shame she\u2019s received one at all,\u201d one commenter tweeted.\n\nEven before this setback, Victoria Fuller had been a controversial contestant on Peter Weber\u2019s season of The Bachelor. She previously caused drama due to her past relationship with country singer Chase Rice, who was blindsided when he was hired to serenade Victoria and Peter during a one-on-one date.\n\nThe Bachelor airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["reality TV", "the bachelor", "TV", "Entertainment"], "tags": ["The Bachelor"], "authors": ["Victoria Miller"], "publish_date": "Tue Feb  4 11:49:47 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Peter Weber\u2019s sizzling cover with Victoria Fuller has been pulled by the magazine.
