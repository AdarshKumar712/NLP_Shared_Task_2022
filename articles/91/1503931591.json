The company says that App Store users \u201care experiencing a problem with this service,\u201d and that they are \u201cinvestigating this issue.\u201d According to developers, it\u2019s not currently possible to successfully get in-app purchases.\n\nFortnite\u2019s official Twitter profile revealed that the in-game store has been temporarily deactivated to avoid further problems for users. Christian Selig, developer of the Apollo for Reddit app, also reported problems with Apple\u2019s services.\n\nApple generally uses a yellow blob to indicate \u201cissues\u201d with a service, even when it is a severe one impacting many customers. The page is not always the most reliable source of details when it comes to downtime for Apple\u2019s services, but it does show that Apple is aware of the problems many users are facing this morning.\n\nThe App Store issue does not seem to have affected other services like Apple Music and iCloud.\n\nWe\u2019ll update this article when the problem has been solved. Did you have any problems with the App Store today? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nWe have disabled the Store on iOS devices due to purchases on the App Store not being completed. \u2014 Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) January 24, 2020\n\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
