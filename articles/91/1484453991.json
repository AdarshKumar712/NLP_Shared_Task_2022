The earlier headline drew from a story filed by news agency IANS. The story has also been updated to include the statement issued by IIT Kanpur.)\n\nKANPUR: An internal probe committee of IIT-K which is probing if the protest march by students on the campus against crackdown on Jamia students last month had violated curbs in the city, will also look into alleged raising of anti-India slogans with communal connotation.\u201cA high-level committee investigating the matter from all angles will also probe whether anti-India slogans were raised and communal statements delivered,\u201d institute director Prof Abhay Karandikar told reporters here on Wednesday.When specifically asked whether anti-national slogans were raised during the march, IIT-K director Prof Karandikar said, \u201cThe investigation will look into this charge. Any action will be taken only when the report is tabled before us in 15 days.\u201dIIT-K students had taken out amarch on the institute campus on December 17 to extend support to Jamia students, who faced police action during anti-CAA protests.After the march, a faculty member of the institute had given a complaint to the institute administration, alleging the students raised slogans which had an anti-India and communal slant. The institute released a statement through its media cell on December 17, stating a request had come from some students to take out march to protest police action against Jamia students. After consultation with the district administration, the institute declined permission and appealed to students to instead hold an indoor meeting.\u201cThough many agreed, a small number of students had decided to go ahead with the march,\u201d the media cell of the institute had said in the statement.On December 21, Prof Karandikar had written on his Twitter handle \u2014 \u201cInstitute never permitted any such protest/march. Deputy Director and Dean advised students against such activity. A high-level committee with the power to take disciplinary action has been constituted based on complaints received. IIT-Kanpur system does not tolerate any indiscipline.\u201d A student who did not wish to be named told TOI the protest march was against the police crackdown on Jamia students and they had nothing to do with the amended Citizenship Act or National Register of Citizens. She said the professor, who made the complaint with the institute, had misunderstood the entire matter.In an article published on IIT-Kanpur student\u2019s media portal, students had clarified what exactly happened on the day of protest and how their chant was given a \u201ccommunal and misleading\u201d turn. The students stated they recited only a few lines of a particular poem in reference to the police crackdown on the students of Jamia.\u201cSince yesterday some media has been reporting that IIT-Kanpur has set up a committee to decide if a poem by poet Faiz is anti-Hindu or not. This is extremely misleading. The reality is that institute received a complaint from multiple sections of the community that during a protest march taken out by students certain poem was read and then subsequently some social media posts were made which were inflammatory. The institute has also received complaints from other sections of the community that a group had tried to block the march. This is incorrect. The institute has set up a committee to look into all these complaints and also see if these complaints are genuine or not and if they are found to be true then what remedial action needs to be taken,\u201d said deputy director, IIT-Kanpur, Prof Manindra Agarwal in a video byte released by IIT-Kanpur\u2019s media cell on Thursday evening. He also said that the committee to probe all these complaints has been set up by the Director. The committee will give its recommendations to the Director after completing the probe.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Kanpur news", "Kanpur latest news", "Kanpur news live", "Kanpur news today", "Today news Kanpur", "Uttar Pradesh news", "Uttar Pradesh", "kanpur news", "IIT Kanpur", "faiz poem"], "tags": ["Mumbai Rains", "Chennai Rains", "Delhi Pollution", "Mumbai Floods", "Srinagar encounter", "Bangalore Rains", "IIT Kanpur", "Delhi Earthquake", "Madras High Court"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "IIT-Kanpur students had taken out a march on the institute campus on December 17 to extend support to Jamia students, who faced police crackdown in De", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "IIT-Kanpur students had taken out a march on the institute campus on December 17 to extend support to Jamia students, who faced police crackdown in De", "keywords": "Kanpur news, Kanpur latest news, Kanpur news live, Kanpur news today, Today news Kanpur,Uttar Pradesh news,Uttar Pradesh,kanpur news,IIT Kanpur,faiz poem", "og": {"title": "Faiz poem: Is Faiz\u2019s poem anti-Hindu?
