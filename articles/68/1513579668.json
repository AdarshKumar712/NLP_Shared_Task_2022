The employment file was also missing.\n\nAnyone who recognizes the suspect in a surveillance image released by police is asked to contact investigators.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Feb  4 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://westernnews.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-3/custom/dcourier/logos/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "__sync_contentCategory": "Paid", "__sync_tenantId": "wn_pni", "fb": {"app_id": 348030695626645}, "og": {"title": "Police: Worker stole $17,000 worth of stuff on first shift", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.dcourier.com/news/2020/feb/04/police-worker-stole-17000-worth-stuff-first-shift/", "image": "https://westernnews.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2020/02/04/Hampden-PD.jpg", "description": "Police in Connecticut are trying to identify a man they say got a job at a gas station and proceeded to steal $17,000 worth of merchandise and cash on his first, and only, solo overnight shift before disappearing.", "site_name": "The Daily Courier"}, "twitter": {"title": "Police: Worker stole $17,000 worth of stuff on first shift", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@www.dcourier.com", "image": "https://westernnews.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2020/02/04/Hampden-PD.jpg", "description": "Police in Connecticut are trying to identify a man they say got a job at a gas station and proceeded to steal $17,000 worth of merchandise and cash on his first, and only, solo overnight shift before disappearing.", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.dcourier.com/news/2020/feb/04/police-worker-stole-17000-worth-stuff-first-shift/"}
