Fortnite\u2019s Winterfest challenge today is New Year\u2019s themed, just like it was last year, asking you to launch some fireworks and celebrate 2020, whatever it might bring. Read on for a map, guide and location for where to launch frozen fireworks found on beaches at Dirty Docks, Craggy Cliffs and Sweaty Sands. Your reward will be the quite stylish 2020 glider.\n\nWe know where we\u2019re going: it\u2019s right there in the name. Spawns for frozen fireworks do not seem to be consistent, so the best you can do is head to one of the requisite coastlines and just start running around until you find one of them. I\u2019ve marked each coastline on the map here:\n\nFortnite Credit: Epic Games\n\nYou\u2019ll want to land right away, because once a Firework is launched, it\u2019s launched, even if you didn\u2019t launch it. Just get down early, fire something off and try to stay alive to earn the glider.\n\nA note: like an idiot, I initially just sort of loaded up a match and tried to light fireworks, but didn\u2019t see anything on the ground. That\u2019s because these things will not spawn unless you head to the Winterfest cabin first and open your stocking, thus triggering the challenge. So don\u2019t be like me, and don\u2019t forget to open your stocking.\n\n2019 was a year of stabilization for Fortnite. It started things off near the peak of its fame, but declined off of those highs throughout the year. This is pretty standard for any game that becomes as big a phenomenon as Fortnite, but it can still be a bit of a come down for fans when it actually happens.\n\n2020 should be an interesting year, however. It\u2019s starting off slow with a dramatically extended Chapter 2, Season 1, but then we\u2019ll see if Epic has used some of that extra time to build some more features. But expect more standard content, an expanded creative mode, and more likely than not a ton of crossover events. We\u2019ll see what happens.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Dave Thier", "I'M A Freelance Writer Whose Work Has Appeared In The Atlantic", "The New York Times", "The New Republic", "Ign.Com", "Wired", "More.
