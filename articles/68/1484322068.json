Newsonline\u2013 The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has confirmed that its Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE neutralised several Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) at Abulam in the Sambisa Forest area of Borno.\n\nThe NAF said it also destroyed some of the terrorists\u2019 structures in their camp at Abulam.\n\nAir Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, NAF Director of Public Relations and Information who disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja, said the operation was conducted on Tuesday.\n\nDaramola said the mission was executed to mark the commencement of Operation RATTLE SNAKE 2.\n\nOperation Rattle Snake 2 is an Air Interdiction Operation aimed at taking out some identified insurgent camps and logistics facilities in order to further unhinge the terrorists\u2019 centre of gravity and diminish their fighting capability.\n\nHe explained that Abullam was selected for attack on Day One of the Operation based on credible intelligence reports indicating that the terrorists had resumed using the once abandoned settlement as a staging point from where they launch attacks against own ground troops\u2019 locations.\n\n\u201d Accordingly, the ATF detailed its attack aircraft, supported by an Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, to attack designated compounds within the settlement.\n\n\u201d The jets took turns to engage the target in successive passes leading to the destruction of some of the structures as well as the killing of several terrorists,\u201d he said.\n\nDaramola recalled that NAF in early to mid Dec. 2019, planned and executed the highly successful Operation RATTLE SNAKE 1.\n\nHe said Operation RATTLE SNAKE 2 was conceived to consolidate the gains of the earlier operation and shape the battle space for further air and ground operations.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Innocent Senyo"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang":
