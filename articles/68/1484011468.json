We expect this to lay the foundation for substantive agreements that will be reached by October, during a large-scale political summit \"Russia - Africa\" \u200b\u200band the economic forum,\" Slepnev pointed out. At the same time, more than 3,000 foreign delegates, as well as 2,000 Russian representatives, will take part in the events.\n\nREC predicts the volume of Russian-African trade relations will double within the next 3-4 years. \"The Russian Export Center maintains a close partnership with Afreximbank and has already entered the first deals that we are jointly implementing on the African continent. We intend to increase the volumes [export support \u2014 TASS], and I am sure that this year\u2019s events will certainly make a big contribution, and we foresee the volume of the Russian-African trade ties in the next three to four years doubling,\" said Slepnev.\n\nBasic financial instruments of supporting trade between Russia and Africa can be direct loans to foreign buyers (including those secured by the sovereign guarantee of the borrowing country) and loans to banks of foreign buyers under the insurance coverage Exiar, loans to sovereign borrowers, financing receivables against export earnings. In 2018, the volume of export-supported Russian products to African countries amounted to $ 2,47 bln.

REC expects that this year about 100 agreements on the intention to participate the Russian industrial zone project in Egypt will be concluded.\n\n\u201cWe are the managing structure in this project, we are cooperating with the Russian enterprises. About 20 agreements have already been signed, we aim for 100 agreements this year. We see that interest is higher than we have expected,\u201d Slepnev reported. Earlier, the Russian government approved the rules for granting budget subsidies to the Russian Export Center for the establishment and operation of the industrial zone project in Egypt.\n\nThe intergovernmental agreement between Russia and Egypt, which regulates all the details, was signed on May 23, 2018.
