Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images\n\nTopline: Despite SoftBank Group reporting a 99% drop in third-quarter profits on Wednesday, its stock has continued to gain momentum recently, in large part thanks to the approval of a merger between SoftBank-owned Sprint and T-Mobile.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund took a $2 billion loss last quarter after writing down investments in WeWork and Uber, slashing the company\u2019s operating income by 99%\u2014from nearly $4 billion to less than $25 million, compared to a year earlier.\n\nSoftBank stock was down slightly on the news Wednesday, falling by 0.6% as founder Masayoshi Son said that the fund\u2019s recent poor performance was spooking investors and causing big losses.\n\nSon has reportedly scaled back his ambitions for a second Vision Fund, following SoftBank\u2019s disastrous bet on WeWork and pressure from activist investor Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund, Elliott Management.\n\nDespite such dismal earnings figures, SoftBank stock is largely holding steady\u2014with no substantial decline on Wednesday, especially after it surged 12% Tuesday when a federal judge approved the $26 billion merger between T-Mobile and Sprint.\n\nSprint stock skyrocketed 77% on the news and SoftBank, which owns almost 85% of Sprint, subsequently netted more than $12 billion on paper.\n\nThe company\u2019s latest earnings release comes amid ongoing discussions with activist fund Elliott Management, which amassed a $2.5 billion stake in the Japanese conglomerate and is pushing for stock buybacks, improved corporate governance and more transparency on the Vision Fund\u2019s investments.\n\nCrucial statistics: SoftBank stock is still up nearly 20% so far this year. The Japanese conglomerate currently has a market cap of $110 billion, up from $90 billion at the start of 2020. SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son is Japan\u2019s second richest person, with a net worth of $24.2 billion, according to Forbes\u2019 estimates. His fortune rose by $2.3 billion alone on Tuesday, when T-Mobile and Sprint won approval for their $26 billion merger.\n\nCrucial quotes: \u201cThe tide has turned,\u201d Son said in a press conference, while trying to highlight the Vision Fund\u2019s improving performance. \u201cThere is no change to my basic vision or strategy.\u201d In terms of addressing the activist demands from Elliott, Son said that his own interests were \u201cbasically aligned\u201d with other shareholders, especially given the fact that he has a 25% stake in SoftBank.\n\nKey background: SoftBank stock fell 12% in the second half of 2019, amid mounting losses from missed bets on unproven tech startups. SoftBank spent around $10 billion bailing out WeWork in October, after the embattled office startup cancelled its IPO and almost ran out of cash to fund its business. Uber stock, on the other hand, lost almost 25% of its value in 2019 after going public in May, though shares have since recovered.\n\nWhat to watch for: SoftBank\u2019s ongoing discussions with Elliott Management. Both sides have said they want to keep the engagement friendly, and dialogue between the two sides has so far gone well, according to the Wall Street Journal. Founded in 1977 by billionaire Paul Singer\u2014a famed activist investor and veteran of numerous proxy battles, Elliott is pushing for stock buybacks and improved corporate governance in an effort to boost SoftBank\u2019s lagging share price. SoftBank is one of the hedge fund\u2019s largest positions.\n\nFurther reading: Sprint Stock Soars 77% On T-Mobile Merger, Here\u2019s Why One Expert Thinks It Could Keep Surging\n\nBillionaire Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management Invests Over $2.5 Billion In SoftBank: Report", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["softbank", "softbank group", "masayoshi son", "wework", "uber", "sprint", "t-mobile", "sprint merger", "t-mobile sprint merger", "Japan", "SoftBank CEO", "Vision Fund", "Elliott Management", "Paul Singer", "activist hedge fund", "Japanese conglomerate", "WeWork IPO", "Japanese billionaire", "billionaire investor"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Sergei Klebnikov"], "publish_date": "Wed Feb 12 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "SoftBank emerged as a big winner from the T-Mobile and Sprint merger.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=2,user-scalable=yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "og": {"site_name": "Forbes", "title": "SoftBank Profits Fall 99%, But Here\u2019s Why The Stock Has Risen 14% This Week", "image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F1205730846%2F960x0.jpg", "updated_time": "2020-02-12T13:14:45-05:00", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/02/12/softbank-profits-fall-99-but-heres-why-the-stock-has-risen-14-this-week/", "description": "SoftBank emerged as a big winner from the T-Mobile and Sprint merger.", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@forbes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "SoftBank Profits Fall 99%, But Here\u2019s Why The Stock Has Risen 14% This Week", "description": "SoftBank emerged as a big winner from the T-Mobile and Sprint merger.", "image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x300/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F1205730846%2F960x0.jpg", "creator": "@sergeiklebnikov"}, "description": "SoftBank emerged as a big winner from the T-Mobile and Sprint merger.", "keywords": "softbank, softbank group, masayoshi son, wework, uber, sprint, t-mobile, sprint merger, t-mobile sprint merger, Japan, SoftBank CEO, Vision Fund, Elliott Management, Paul Singer, activist hedge fund, Japanese conglomerate, WeWork IPO, Japanese billionaire, billionaire investor", "author": "Sergei Klebnikov", "news_keywords": "softbank, softbank group, masayoshi son, wework, uber, sprint, t-mobile, sprint merger, t-mobile sprint merger, Japan, SoftBank CEO, Vision Fund, Elliott Management, Paul Singer, activist hedge fund, Japanese conglomerate, WeWork IPO, Japanese billionaire, billionaire investor", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes", "author": "Sergei Klebnikov", "section": "Money", "section_url": "https://www.forbes.com/markets/", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/3781-5e443f1fd424b1000638b03e", "published": "2020-02-12", "modified": "2020-02-12"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/02/12/softbank-profits-fall-99-but-heres-why-the-stock-has-risen-14-this-week/"}
