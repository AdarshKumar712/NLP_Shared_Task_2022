Follow These Steps\n\n\u201cOur new data provide additional mechanistic insights into these adverse health effects, especially high blood pressure and potentially cancer development, both leading causes of global death,\u201d said study researcher Matthias Oelze from the University Medical Centre of Mainz in Germany.\n\nPublished in The FASEB Journal, the research found that healthy mice exposed to four days of aircraft noise were more likely to develop high blood pressure.\n\nFor mice with pre-established high blood pressure, this noise exposure aggravated heart damage because of a synergistic increase of oxidative stress and inflammation in the cardiovascular and neuronal systems.\n\nIn another study, the researchers observed that the same noise exposure induced oxidative DNA damage in mice. This damage led to a highly mutagenic DNA lesion that was previously associated with the development of cancer in other settings.\n\nThey are currently conducting several studies on the health effects of noise, including interactions of pre-established cardiovascular diseases with noise as well as behavioural effects of noise exposure in mice.\n\n\u201cThese new findings, together with our other work on noise-associated cardiovascular effects, could lead to a better understanding of how noise influences health,\u201d said Oelze.\n\n\u201cThis information could help inform policies and regulations that better protect people against diseases related to noise exposure,\u201d Oelze noted.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["cancer", "High Blood Pressure", "noise", "Noise Pollution"], "tags": ["Noise Pollution", "cancer", "High Blood Pressure", "noise"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sun May  3 16:15:33 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Two new mouse studies provide new insight into how this type of noise exposure can lead to high blood pressure and cancer-related DNA damage.  - High Noise Can Lead to Cancer-Related Damage And Blood Pressure Issues, Read on", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/76x761.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": "111369852268642,202151043156155,866415226763838,775670142542664"}, "article": {"published": "2020-05-03T16:15:33+05:30", "modified": "2020-05-03T16:15:33+05:30", "published_time": "2020-05-03T16:15:33+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-05-03T16:15:33+05:30", "author": "https://www.india.com/author/ians/"}, "description": "Two new mouse studies provide new insight into how this type of noise exposure can lead to high blood pressure and cancer-related DNA damage.  - High Noise Can Lead to Cancer-Related Damage And Blood Pressure Issues, Read on", "keywords": "cancer,High Blood Pressure,noise,Noise Pollution", "news_keywords": "cancer,High Blood Pressure,noise,Noise Pollution", "robots": "index,follow", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "High Noise Can Lead to Cancer-Related Damage And Blood Pressure Issues, Read on", "description": "Two new mouse studies provide new insight into how this type of noise exposure can lead to high blood pressure and cancer-related DNA damage.", "url": "https://www.india.com/lifestyle/high-noise-can-lead-to-cancer-related-damage-and-blood-pressure-issues-read-on-4018447/", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/loud-speaker.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 700, "height": 415}, "site_name": "India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "IANS", "msvalidate.01": "FD7837E94C694BA88985E0E95C05B284"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.india.com/lifestyle/high-noise-can-lead-to-cancer-related-damage-and-blood-pressure-issues-read-on-4018447/"}
