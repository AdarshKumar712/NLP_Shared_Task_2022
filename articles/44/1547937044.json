That's why you should do everything possible to make your home the most secure place. This means getting a home security system. It's an investment that will pay off and give you peace of mind. Give this article a read for home security advice.\n\n\n\nIf you are planning to be away for a while it is important to stop your paper delivery and put your mail on hold until you return. Newspapers piled up in your driveway or mail spilling out of your mailbox is a red flag that no one is home, and this leaves you vulnerable to thieves.\n\n\n\nDo not leave your garage doors open, even if you are currently home. Burglars will try to get in through the garage, and if it is open, they can easily break through the door to your home. Use a keypad that requires a combination to allow access into your house.\n\n\n\nKeep the area directly alongside your home clear of bushes to eliminate hiding places for intruders. Although having shrubs and ornamental bushes underneath windows and along the sides of your home can be beautiful, they're perfect hiding places for people who are trying to break-in. Keep these potential trouble spots clear, especially in front of and around windows.\n\n\n\nChanging the locks on your home can be a great way to increase security. Locks should always be changed when buying a new home. There could be numerous people that had copies of the keys, from the real estate agent to the previous owners. Locks should also be changed whenever your keys become lost, or after a break-up in a relationship.\n\n\n\nIf you are planning to have the cable guy or repair man come to your house, refrain from putting notes on the door. This shows burglars that you are not currently home, which will make them more prone to robbing your house. Use phone communication to indicate to your servicemen the details of your whereabouts.\n\n\n\nGet your garage clean. Homeowners often use their garage for storage, filling it so full that you can no longer fit a car in. Parking your car in the garage can foil potential thieves in several ways. First of all, they will not be able to break into your car. Additionally, when your car is hidden away in the garage, it is harder to track whether you are actually home or not.\n\n\n\nIt's a good idea to have motion sensor lights installed. The lights will be triggered when someone gets too close to the house. Not only will they notify you of movement, they will also deter potential burglars, as thieves want to remain as inconspicuous as possible. Just remember to change out the bulbs every so often so the lights remain in working order.\n\n\n\nWhen doing yard work or fixes on the outside of your home, be sure to put ladders and tools away when you are done. If you keep out ladders, thieves can easily climb them to get into your home. At the same time, they could use tools, like hammers, to break your windows.\n\n\n\nIf your alarm goes off frequently, get it fixed as soon as possible. If your neighbors think your alarm is always going off, they are unlikely to report it to the police. That means it could be a real break in, but no one will actually do anything about it.\n\n\n\nSadly, there is no one home exempt from threats. Luckily, there are measures that can be taken to keep your home as safe as possible. This article has several great home security tips. Use them in order to protect your house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo What It Takes To Keep Your Home Safe And Sound\n\nIf you are concerned about the security of your home, you should be!
