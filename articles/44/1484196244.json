Najee Harris gave the Tide their last touchdown with 26 seconds left as the Tide scored 21 unanswered second-half points.\n\nMore: Wojo: Same old bowl tune for Jim Harbaugh's Wolverines\n\nThe Wolverines (9-4) were hoping to reach the 10-win plateau and numb some of the disappointment of another regular season-ending loss to Ohio State with a signature win over a big-name program. Some wondered whether Alabama, typically in the national playoff this time of year, would be mentally into playing this bowl.\n\nMichigan quarterback Shea Patterson scrambles against Alabama. (Photo: John Raoux, AP)\n\nClearly, Alabama coach Nick Saban got his players\u2019 attention in the second half, holding the Wolverines scoreless while the Tide offense hit big plays and swung the momentum after trailing 16-14 at halftime.\n\nMichigan\u2019s only touchdown came on a 7-yard pass from Shea Patterson to Nick Eubanks in the first quarter, and Quinn Nordin came through with three field goals, including a Michigan-record-tying 57-yarder before the half.\n\n\u201cTheir ability to create the big play was critical in the game and their ability to keep us out of the end zone \u2014 we had long drives and settled for field goals,\u201d Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said. \u201cI think at the end, you know, stopping us when we had a chance on the interception and then came back and drove the length of the field for 80 yards or so (in the first quarter), that was a huge difference in the game.\u201d\n\nBOX SCORE: Alabama 35, Michigan 16\n\nThe main storyline during the weeks heading into the game was Alabama\u2019s receivers, featuring three first-round NFL prospects, and they didn\u2019t disappoint. Alabama receiver Jerry Jeudy was a back-breaker for the Wolverines. On the Tide\u2019s first play of the game, Jeudy scored on an 85-yard reception. Then, in the fourth quarter, he had a huge 58-yard catch in Alabama\u2019s scoring drive that built a 28-16 lead. Jeudy finished with 204 yards and of Alabama\u2019s 405 total yards, 322 were passing.\n\nBut perhaps even more telling was how Saban was able to get his players interested in finishing a season that had disappointments including key injuries on defense early on and two losses to LSU and Auburn late in the season. The Tide finished 11-2.\n\n\u201cThis team had a lot to prove in this game,\u201d Saban said. \u201cWe have a culture of how we play football at Alabama, with great effort, great toughness, but also discipline to execute and accountability for everybody to do their job. That's always been the trademark of what we do. And people make decisions based on what's best for the team.\n\nCLOSE\n\n\u201cI thought that maybe at the end of the year this year in a couple games that we played, you know, half of the LSU game and maybe at Auburn, we didn't really do that the way \u2014 to the standard that I would like and to our expectation, and I think the players realized that. And I think they wanted to prove that, you know, this is the culture that was established for a number of years here by a lot of good players, and I think they have a lot of pride in that and I think they wanted to come out today and prove that this is what Alabama football, the culture of Alabama football is really all about.\u201d\n\nThe Wolverines had proven their vulnerability in pass defense in the loss to Ohio State when the Buckeyes had 15 receptions for 313 yards and four touchdowns. They were equally as porous against the Crimson Tide.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s kind of hard, but I keep saying it\u2019s explosive plays,\u201d Michigan linebacker Cam McGrone said. \u201cOhio State had a whole bunch of passes down the field, quarterback scrambling, Alabama the same thing. It was like you were looking in a mirror.\u201d\n\nIn his final game as Michigan\u2019s quarterback, Shea Patterson was 17-of-37 for 33 yards and had one touchdown and two interceptions, including one late in the game. Michigan had 395 total yards, including 162 rushing.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t play my best,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cMissed a few throws. Thought I could have calmed my feet down early on. I felt like I didn\u2019t make enough plays. Yeah, not my best game.\u201d\n\nCLOSE\n\nIn the first half, although Michigan settled for field goals after the first touchdowns, it appeared the Wolverines had a slight upper hand. They ran 45 plays in the first half to Alabama\u2019s 23 and had 286 total yards, including 135 rushing. Zach Charbonnet had 10 carries for 73 yards but finished the game with 84 yards on 13 carries.\n\nSaban said Michigan was hurting Alabama running the ball in the first half, so the Tide made adjustments.\n\n\u201cIn the second half we decided to play nickel, which gives us more multiples of things that we can to. We're a little smaller on the field when we do that, but it's easier to adjust and the players did a really good job of it and we were able to pressure more, which really helped us stop the run.\u201d\n\nMichigan gave up 153 rushing yards, but Najee Harris, who finished with 136 on 24 carries, got his second touchdown with 26 seconds left on a 2-yard run.\n\nMcGrone was asked how deflating it was giving up the late score.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of a smack in the face, but it is what it is,\u201d McGrone said. \u201cIt\u2019s football. We\u2019ve got to be ready all times, and we weren\u2019t ready that play.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Michigan couldn\u2019t play a complete game.\n\n\u201cWe played them well in the first half,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cQuinn came in and kicked the ball really well. Defense played lights out. It\u2019s a tough one. Alabama\u2019s a great team. They had a lot of great players. Didn\u2019t do enough to win.\u201d\n\nBowled over\n\nJim Harbaugh is 1-4 in bowl games as Michigan\u2019s coach:\n\n2015 season: Beat Florida in Citrus Bowl, 41-17\n\n2016: Lost to Florida State in Orange Bowl, 33-32\n\n2017: Lost to South Carolina in Outback Bowl, 26-19\n\n2018: Lost to Florida in Peach Bowl, 41-15\n\n2019: Lost to Alabama in Citrus Bowl, 35-16\n\nDirty half-dozen\n\nMichigan has given up 35 or more points six times, all losses, during Don Brown\u2019s tenure as the Wolverines\u2019 defensive coordinator:\n\n2017\n\nPenn State: L, 42-13\n\n2018\n\nOhio State: L, 62-39\n\nFlorida: L, 41-15\n\n2019\n\nWisconsin: L, 35-14\n\nOhio State: L, 56-27\n\nAlabama: L, 35-16", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Angelique S.
