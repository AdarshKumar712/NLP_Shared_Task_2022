The event was in aid of 12-year-old Charlie Ilsley, of Buckingham Drive, Emmer Green, who has been undergoing treatment on and off since he was first diagnosed in 2015 and was given the all-clear twice only for the disease to return in November.\n\nCharlie visited the shop with his mother Toni and the fundraising was continuing this week.\n\nThe pop-up shop, which opened in September, was launched by Kellie Henderson and Elisa Lionetti with the aim of providing the community with a wide range of unique, handcrafted products made by local people.\n\nMrs Henderson thanked everyone who attended on Saturday.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe have raised money for different charities and I wanted to do something more local.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got 12-year-old twins so I wanted to do anything I could to help. It was lovely having Charlie here \u2014 it really made a difference. For 50p cakes, I think the amount we raised was a great achievement. It would have been a lot better had the weather not been so bad.\u201d\n\nMrs Ilsley said: \u201cIt was really nice of Kellie to do this. My neighbour Janice Judd made quiches and scones and I went to Waitrose and bought a chocolate cake and a Victoria sponge and when I got there there were loads already.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A CRAFT shop in Caversham held a fundraising day for a boy battling cancer for the third time.
