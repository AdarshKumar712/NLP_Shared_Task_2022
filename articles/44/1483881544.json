We won the first election in Ekiti State.\u201cBy the special grace of God, we also won the next election which was the Osun State\u2019s governorship election.\u201cThe next election was the Presidential and National Assembly elections, and by the special grace of God, we won the presidency and our President was re-elected for the second term.\u201cWe also won more seats in the Senate and we won more seats in the House of Representatives.\u201cUnlike in 2015, we managed our victory more creatively, smartly and we conducted peaceful secret ballot and our party won all the principal officers that were there to be contested.\u201cWe went to Kogi State and we won. We then went deeper to the South-South, Bayelsa State, the heart of the Ijaw nation.\u201cWe fielded a candidate; a humble man from a very humble beginning and as we can see, we have Bayelsa State.\u201cBy February, he will be sworn in and the number of the APC governors will increase.\u201cSo, I am proud to say that under my chairmanship, we won one state in the South-South. It is not just another state, it is a very special state, the state that produced the immediate past president.\u201cI have no enemies; I have brothers and I have sisters. Some may be happy with me today some may not be happy with me tomorrow but that is alright.\u201cWe have quality minds because the governance of our country and the quality of politics must reflect the quality of the people who are in it.\u201cSo, we are not just celebrating good people today, we are celebrating quality re-union with my brothers and my sisters.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Politics"], "authors": ["Luis Ch\u00e1vez"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "NigerianEye is a Nigerian Online NewsPaper and Breaking News Source.\nNIGERIA NEWS \u2605 TOP NIGERIAN Newspapers \u2605 Top news headlines from Nigeria.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "generator": "blogger", "og": {"title": "I'm not concerned about plans to remove me - Oshiomole", "type": "article", "description": "NigerianEye is a Nigerian Online NewsPaper and Breaking News Source.\nNIGERIA NEWS \u2605 TOP NIGERIAN Newspapers \u2605 Top news headlines from Nigeria.", "url": "http://www.nigerianeye.com/2020/01/im-not-concerned-about-plans-to-remove.html", "site_name": "Nigerian News.
