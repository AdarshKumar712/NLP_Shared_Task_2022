Additionally, when paired with the three-year contract renewal, the City will also receive an additional 15 percent of the dollar value in fireworks free for each of those three years.\n\nFollowing tradition in Elkhorn, this year\u2019s fireworks display will be held at dusk on the Friday before the July 4 holiday, July 3.\n\nUnder the three-year contract extension, the City will receive the 15 percent bonus each of the three years, as well as the 8 percent bonus if payment and paperwork is received by J&M Displays at least 70 days before the annual show.\n\nThe contract also states that the City will purchase fireworks exclusively from J&M Displays, but the City is not obligated to purchase fireworks any of the three years. However, this does mean if the City were to choose not to purchase fireworks any of those years, it would not be able to purchase fireworks from another vendor.\n\nEach year following the fireworks display, the City will also have a 30-day timeline in which it could choose to terminate the three-year contract.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had no issues this company,\u201d City Administrator James Heilman said during the recent discussion.\n\nCity Attorney Ward Phillps also noted that the contract seems to be very favorable for the City, and contains language that also protects the City.\n\nA motion to approve the contract for 2020 and the three-year extension was approved 6-0.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Heather Ruenz"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 20:30:22 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.8.10", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Having a blast", "url": "http://mywalworthcounty.com/?p=35054", "description": "City of Elkhorn renews fireworks with J&M Displays By Kellen Olshefski Correspondent \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The City of Elkhorn Common Council recently voted in favor of both a one-year contract and a new three\u2026", "site_name": "MyWalworthCounty.com", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T20:30:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-12-27T22:16:06+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Having a blast"}, "card": "summary"}}, "canonical_link": "http://mywalworthcounty.com/?p=35054"}
