No matter how much went on however, that doesn\u2019t mean that 2020 won\u2019t be another year full of some ups and downs for the House of Windsor.\n\nThe royal family doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing down when it comes to their plans for the next calendar year. Here are some big things to potentially look forward to.\n\nQueen Elizabeth, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall:\n\nPhoto: Getty Images/Chris Jackson\n\nRumors are more rampant than ever that Queen Elizabeth is preparing to invoke the Regency Act after her 95th birthday in 2021, which would allow her to basically step back from all her duties as Queen while still retaining her title, and giving Prince Charles the ability to somewhat rule in her place. However, the Queen has made no moves to suggest this is true, though she has been slowly preparing her heir for his eventual role as King, giving him more responsibility and increasing his public profile and presence.\n\nAs for the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, they aren\u2019t expected to have any large celebrations on their calendar, though their public roles could increase with more engagements as they take on more responsibilities.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton:\n\nPhoto: AFP/Aamir QURESHI\n\nAfter a big year which saw the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge become the sole heads of The Royal Foundation, they are looking ahead to another big year as well, which will include new initiatives and more focus on their charity work.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle:\n\nPhoto: Chris Jackson - WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nAfter a year that saw them welcome their first child together, there was a lot of turmoil for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who not only started lawsuits against publications that they felt invaded their privacy but also took a six-week break at the end of the year from their royal duties. As for what fans can expect from them in 2020\u2014 the couple may once again team up with Prince William and Kate as they all take on more work following Prince Andrew\u2019s stepping back from royal life.\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi:\n\nPhoto: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images\n\nAnother royal wedding is set to take place in 2020, as Princess Beatrice officially ties the knot with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. Details about the pair\u2019s nuptials have remained under wraps thus far.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["royal family 2020", "royal family news", "queen elizabeth january 5th", "queen elizabeth retiring", "will prince charles be crowned king", "kate middleton pregnant", "meghan markle pregnant", "princess eugenie pregnant", "princess beatrice engaged"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 11:00:03 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The royal family may have quite a lot happening in 2020.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "royal family 2020, royal family news, queen elizabeth january 5th, queen elizabeth retiring, will prince charles be crowned king, kate middleton pregnant, meghan markle pregnant, princess eugenie pregnant, princess beatrice engaged", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/what-expect-meghan-markle-kate-middleton-royal-family-2020-2893383", "title": "What To Expect From Meghan Markle, Kate Middleton And The Royal Family In 2020", "description": "The royal family may have quite a lot happening in 2020.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2019/03/20/royal-family.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2019/03/20/royal-family.jpg", "height": 416, "width": 594, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "Lauren Dubois", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T11:00:03-05:00", "published_time": "2020-01-01T11:00:03-05:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What To Expect From Meghan Markle, Kate Middleton And The Royal Family In 2020", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/what-expect-meghan-markle-kate-middleton-royal-family-2020-2893383", "description": "The royal family may have quite a lot happening in 2020.", "image": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2019/03/20/royal-family.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-config": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#000000", "keywords": "royal family 2020, royal family news, queen elizabeth january 5th, queen elizabeth retiring, will prince charles be crowned king, kate middleton pregnant, meghan markle pregnant, princess eugenie pregnant, princess beatrice engaged", "author": "Lauren Dubois", "description": "The royal family may have quite a lot happening in 2020."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.com/what-expect-meghan-markle-kate-middleton-royal-family-2020-2893383"}
