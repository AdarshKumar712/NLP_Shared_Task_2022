Many of them involve goals, champagne, and fresh starts (minus the diet, OF COURSE). But one way we really enjoy welcoming in the new? With a themed workout!\n\nWe\u2019ve done this for a few years now (see here for a fun one), but here\u2019s the gist: we take the year and design a really fun full-body, no-equipment-needed workout around it. Since it\u2019s now 2020, you\u2019ll be doing 20 reps of the following 20 moves for one sweat-filled and heart-pumping workout!\n\nGrab a mat, some water, a towel, your favorite tunes (try these if you\u2019re looking for musical inspiration), and get to it! (And, yep, for all the moves that you do on each side of your body \u2014 like lunges and mountain climbers \u2014 doing them on both sides one time equals one rep.)\n\nFeeling saucy? Do the whole thing two times \u2026 or even three times through!\n\n\u2013Jenn", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["try these"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Jan 20 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Welcome in the New Year on a sweaty note with this fun themed 2020 workout that is full body and requires no equipment.
