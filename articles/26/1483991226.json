He also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans and a world endurance title.\n\nThe expectations for Alonso are comparable to those raised by French driver Sebastien Loeb, a nine-time rally world champion who competed in the Dakar Rally from 2016 to 2019, winning 13 stages but never finishing first overall.\n\n\u201cIf Loeb still hasn\u2019t won the Dakar, imagine me, who is coming from asphalt. I think the goal is more to approach the rally as an enriching experience for us,\u201d Alonso told RTVE last Friday before leaving for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe 45-year-old Loeb was unable to take home the bronze Touareg Trophy despite being the best driver in rally history and having skills that fit the Dakar Rally better than Formula 1.\n\nEven though Loeb did not have to make huge adjustments, he still came up short in his bid to win the Dakar, whose inaugural edition was held in 1979.\n\nLoeb always had a co-driver who provided navigation on the rally route, a new thing for the Spanish racer.\n\nAlonso, who has always driven alone, will have veteran Marc Coma, a five-time rally champ in the motorcycle category, helping him navigate the route.\n\nThe Spanish driver has the triple crown of motor racing within reach.\n\nAlonso, who has already won the F1 Monaco Grand Prix and the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the endurance category, must win the Indianapolis 500 to achieve the feat.\n\nBriton Graham Hill is the only driver to ever win the motor racing triple crown.\n\nIf Alonso can win the Dakar Rally, he will be considered one of the best all-around drivers ever.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, a route covering nearly 8,000 kilometres (4,970 miles), with more than 5,000 kilometres (3,106 miles) timed, awaits racers, who will start in Jeddah and finish in Qiddiyah, near Riyadh.\n\nThe Dakar Rally starts on January 5.\n\n\u2013IANS\n\nrkm/bg", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["first", "dakar", "compete", "become", "champion", "alonso", "rally"], "authors": ["Canindia New Wire Service", "Author"], "publish_date": "Fri Dec 20 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-CINEWS-ICON1-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"title": "Alonso to become first F1 champion to compete in Dakar Rally", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.canindia.com/alonso-to-become-first-f1-champion-to-compete-in-dakar-rally/", "site_name": "Canindia News", "description": "Madrid, Jan 1 (IANS) Spain's Fernando Alonso is set to become the first Formula 1 champion to compete in the Dakar Rally, which starts on Sunday in Saudi Arabia", "image": "http://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AVTAR_CI2019-1.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Alonso to become first F1 champion to compete in Dakar Rally", "description": "Madrid, Jan 1 (IANS) Spain's Fernando Alonso is set to become the first Formula 1 champion to compete in the Dakar Rally, which starts on Sunday in Saudi Arabia", "image": "http://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AVTAR_CI2019-1.png"}, "author": "CanIndia New Wire Service", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.5", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-CINEWS-ICON1-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.canindia.com/alonso-to-become-first-f1-champion-to-compete-in-dakar-rally/"}
