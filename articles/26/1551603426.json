Bernie Sanders put forth a far-reaching plan Tuesday night that calls for at least $2 trillion in emergency funding\u2014including for free healthcare and direct cash payments of $2,000 per month to every American\u2014as a way to \u201cmobilize on a scale not seen since the New Deal and World War II to prevent deaths, job losses, and economic ruin\u201d caused by the deadly and growing threat of the coronavirus outbreak now sweeping the United States and much of the world.\n\n\u201cWe must guarantee that everyone who needs care can get it for free, ensure that all workers continue to receive paychecks so they can make ends meet, and stop giant corporations and Wall Street from profiting off the outbreak.\u201d\n\n\u2014Sen. Bernie Sanders\n\n\u201cIn terms of potential deaths and the impact on our economy, the crisis we face from coronavirus is on the scale of a major war, and we must act accordingly,\u201d Sanders said in Tuesday night address. \u201cWe must begin thinking on a scale comparable to the threat, and make sure that we are protecting working people, low-income people, and the most vulnerable communities, not just giant corporations and Wall Street.\u201d\n\nThe new plan\u2014which Sanders set out in a live-streamed address just before polls closed in the primary voting states of Illinois, Florida, and Arizona\u2014gives new policy details to his repeated call that the response to the coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19, be adequately robust and specifically targeted to help those who need it most and done in a way that centers both the short-term and long-term health of the nation\u2019s people and its economy.\n\nWhile former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the winner in each of Tuesday\u2019s primary contests\u2014adding to his already substantial delegate lead\u2014the release of the new plan by Sanders made it clear that the Vermont senator still believes he has a role to play and a vision to share with the nation even as his prospects for winning the Democratic nomination continue to diminish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together,\u201d Sanders said. Referencing people in the U.S. already out of work, those sick or fearful that they or someone they love could become sick, and everyone worried about their ability to get tested or treatment if they need\u2014Sanders emphasized how it is now essential that the needs of working people and the most vulnerable in society are put before corporate interests or those seeking to profit in the midst of the society-wide shock.\n\nThe plan would guarantee that all healthcare needs related to the coronavirus would be free and available to all, including testing, any treatments, and ultimately\u2014when available\u2014the vaccine. The plan also calls for a dramatic investment in the public health system\u2014including an urgent overhaul in terms of testing for the virus\u2014and increased preparedness and support for frontline medical workers, hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. It would also mobilize the National Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, and military resources to build healthcare capacity nationwide.\n\nOn the economic front, Sanders\u2019 plan would issue direct cash payments, in the form of $2,000 check to every American each month for the duration of the crisis. The plan would also establish what the Sanders campaign calls the \u201cEmergency Economic Crisis Finance Agency,\u201d which would be charged with handling the financial downturn unleashed by what is now a global pandemic.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Religious Right"], "authors": ["Common Dreams"], "publish_date": "Wed Mar 18 05:50:09 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet.org", "title": "Bernie Sanders proposal for $2 trillion coronavirus emergency plan includes $2,000 direct monthly payments to every American", "url": "https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/bernie-sanders-proposal-for-2-trillion-coronavirus-emergency-plan-includes-2000-direct-monthly-payments-to-every-american/", "type": "article", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
