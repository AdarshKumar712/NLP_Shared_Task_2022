Today, we officially close the book on 2019. Let\u2019s all stay up together in Bird Droppings tonight and count down as the ball drops in Times Square! ... No, check that, I\u2019ll probably be asleep.\n\nHow was this year for you, Camden Chatters? Did you undergo any dramatic life changes, for better or for worse? Whatever the case, here\u2019s hoping 2020 will be your best year yet.\n\nFor the Orioles, 2019 won\u2019t be a year that will forever be celebrated in franchise lore, but it did represent a fresh start. It was the club\u2019s first full year under GM Mike Elias, manager Brandon Hyde, and a data-oriented front office. The O\u2019s made significant progress in building their analytics department and in ramping up their international amateur signing and scouting efforts. They held the first overall draft pick for only the second time in franchise history, using it to snag Adley Rutschman. They laid the groundwork for developing a consistent pipeline of talent throughout the Orioles\u2019 farm system.\n\nThe on-field performance, of course, was dreadful. And it won\u2019t be much, if any, better in 2020. But the Orioles at least seem to have a coherent plan for future success and are taking the steps they need to implement it. If it eventually pays off, years from now we may look back at 2019 as the year that the turnaround really began.\n\nSo, hey, maybe someday 2019 will be celebrated in franchise lore after all.\n\nLinks\n\nUpdating the Orioles\u2019 rotation competition - School of Roch\n\nUpdate: the rotation still stinks.\n\nFor O\u2019s pitchers less (fastballs) could be more - Steve Melewski\n\nMelewski analyzes whether the Orioles could benefit from throwing fewer fastballs. Maybe! They could also benefit from throwing fewer terrible pitches in general.\n\nIntriguing Options Loom For Orioles With No. 2 Pick In 2020 MLB Draft - PressBoxOnline\n\nForget the countdown to Opening Day \u2014 I\u2019m more interested in the countdown to draft day. (It\u2019s 162 days away, FYI.) Todd Karpovich profiles a few of the highly touted draft prospects who could interest the Orioles on June 10.\n\nWhat awaits O\u2019s in 2020? Key dates and info - Orioles.com\n\nJoe Trezza runs down the important events coming up for the Orioles during the 2020 season. It\u2019s a useful list, but I got a kick out of the \u201cMilestones\u201d category in which the last entry is \u201cCole Sulser and Eric Hanhold could make their team debuts.\u201d Get excited!\n\nOrioles birthdays and history\n\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday! The only Oriole who\u2019s ever had a New Year\u2019s Eve birthday is outfielder Donell Nixon, who appeared in eight games in 1990. He turns 58 today.\n\nOn this day in 2010, a 25-year-old man was killed by a pistol being fired at a New Year\u2019s celebration in Luperon, Dominican Republic. Orioles pitcher Alfredo Simon was later arrested for the shooting and was charged with involuntary murder, but was acquitted a year later.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have to tell you this, but if you\u2019re planning to celebrate the new year, please leave pistols out of it.
