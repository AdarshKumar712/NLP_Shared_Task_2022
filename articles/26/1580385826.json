He wants to be more careful than others.\n\nThe circumstances in Germany, including in Bavaria, were relatively good compared to other countries, Markus S\u00f6der said in Munich. \u201cFortunately, we did not have to go through the kind of situation others did\u201d, the Bavarian First Minister stated. But Germany\u2019s successes were \u201ca delicate little flower\u201d. In order to avoid relapses and a return to harsher measures, the country needed to learn how to live with Corona.\n\nNumbers Cause Optimism\n\nS\u00f6der explained that Bavaria had implemented intensive measures earlier than most other federal states. He said the numbers were partially encouraging, but the state now had more than 1,000 Corona-related deaths. \u201cThose are 1,000 too many\u201d, S\u00f6der stated. The doubling time had increased from two to 22 days by now and the infection rate was below 1. These numbers made him optimistic, S\u00f6der said.\n\nThe doubling time is the time it takes the number of persons infected with the Coronavirus to double. And the infection rate is the number of individuals each infected person passes the virus on to, statistically. As long as that number is below 1, the infection will vanish at some point, in theory.\n\nTime-Displaced Reaction\n\nS\u00f6der made clear what he does not want, namely an \u201cuncontrolled exit strategy\u201d. Bavaria intended to react in a time-displaced way in order to see how the measures affected the number of infections, he said. \u201cWe are sticking to the strategy we were following so far. Where we ease measures, we take action for more protection.\u201d\n\nWhat reopening businesses is concerned, the Bavarian government wanted to be more careful than others, even though the fears of business owners would be taken seriously. Reopening retail businesses required preparation, S\u00f6der explained. That is why the dates differed from those listed in the document that had been approved in Berlin on Wednesday.\n\nPrayer Services in May\n\nBavaria will let home improvement stores and gardening shops open this coming Monday, April 20th, 2020. On April 27th, shops with an area of up to 800 square meters (8,600 square feet) have permission to open. Hairdressers and foot care businesses will have to wait until May 4th. In all cases, hygiene and distance rules apply. In May, S\u00f6der wants to allow prayer services at churches, mosques and synagogues.\n\nRegarding schools, Bavaria is allowing exams to take place from April 27th in the upper secondary school grades. Other grades may return to school on May 11th. Primary schools and kindergartens would have to remain closed for now, S\u00f6der stated.\n\nOktoberfest Might Be Cancelled\n\nThe one thing people around the world think of when they read or hear the word \u2018Bavaria\u2019 is the Oktoberfest. While no decision has been taken to cancel it, things do not look too good in this regard either. S\u00f6der said he was very skeptical and did not believe it could take place this year.\n\nOn January 27th, 2020, Bavaria was the first federal state to report a Coronavirus case. With more than 35,000 infected persons, it is the province most affected by the crisis today.\n\nBy the way: The publication you are reading, The Berlin Spectator, was established in January of 2019.
