Biden Jr. will travel on Monday to Houston to meet with the family of George Floyd, a black man whose death at the hands of the police touched off a nationwide outcry over racism and police brutality.\n\nMr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, will offer his condolences to members of the Floyd family and will also record a video message for Mr. Floyd\u2019s funeral service on Tuesday, according to a Biden aide. Mr. Biden is not expected to attend the service \u2014 given his Secret Service protection, there were concerns about creating a disruption \u2014 but he wanted to offer in-person condolences, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nHis trip to Texas comes against a backdrop of enormous protests against police violence and systemic racism that are unfolding across the country, including huge marches on Saturday, and as Mr. Biden is still navigating how to travel safely during the coronavirus outbreak. Until now, his recent public outings have been limited to his home state Delaware and to nearby Philadelphia.\n\nMr. Biden, the former vice president, has spoken out passionately in recent days about the need to heal racial divisions in the country. He laced into President Trump in a speech last week for fanning the \u201cflames of hate,\u201d and he has advocated a number of new police reforms. While the protests have been largely peaceful, he also nodded to violent clashes between the police and some people in the crowds, as well as looters, urging a \u201cnation enraged\u201d that \u201cwe cannot let our rage consume us.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Katie Glueck"], "publish_date": "Sun Jun  7 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Joe Biden will travel on Monday to offer his condolences to the family of Mr. Floyd, whose killing touched off nationwide protests over police brutality against black Americans.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/vi-assets/static-assets/favicon-4bf96cb6a1093748bf5b3c429accb9b4.ico", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2020-06-07T15:11:59.000Z", "modified": "2020-06-07T15:11:59.000Z", "section": "U.S.", "tag": "Funerals and Memorials", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000007178692, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/c51939b4-cd5c-5ad2-a648-ae185d271f48", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/f4cdd5cc2be44104b728caab43e7930c", "description": "Joe Biden will travel on Monday to offer his condolences to the family of Mr. Floyd, whose killing touched off nationwide protests over police brutality against black Americans.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/07/us/politics/07biden-floyd/07biden-floyd-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Katie Glueck", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/07/us/politics/07biden-floyd/07biden-floyd-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Joe Biden,George Floyd,George Floyd Protests;Minneapolis Protests,Funerals", "pdate": 20200607, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/us/politics/joe-biden-george-floyd-funeral.html", "type": "article", "title": "Biden to Meet With George Floyd\u2019s Family in Houston Ahead of Funeral", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/07/us/politics/07biden-floyd/07biden-floyd-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Former Vice President Joseph R.
