Her son Prince Charles, 71, stands on her right with his arm around his six-year-old grandson Prince George. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's eldest child looks smart in a blue-trimmed white shirt from Amaiakids, a pair of blue and green tartan trousers and a sweet pair of shoes, also by Amaiakids, as he smiles for the camera. The Queen's grandson, Prince William, 37, who is second-in-line to the throne, stands on her left, dressed in a navy-blue suit.\n\nREAD: Prince William teams up with Strictly's Alex Scott and other football stars for important cause\n\nThe new portrait of the Queen, Charles, William and George. Credit: Ranald Mackechnie\n\nThis is only the second time a portrait has been issued of the Queen, Charles, William and George; the first was released in April 2016 to mark Her Majesty's 90th birthday. The youngest royal's elevated position in the new picture is reminiscent of the 2016 photo, when then-two-year-old George stood next to his great-grandmother on a blue and black step, holding the hand of his father, William.\n\nThe latest photo of the four generations of the royal family was taken by the same photographer, Ranald Mackechnie, on Wednesday 18 December 2019 \u2013 the day of the Queen's Christmas lunch for her family. William and George arrived at the festive bash a little earlier than Kate, Charlotte and Louis, so they could make Christmas puddings with the Queen and Prince Charles.\n\nWATCH: Go behind the scenes at HELLO! as we reveal the royal highlights of 2019\n\nThe first photo of the Queen and her three heirs in 2016.

The Together at Christmas initiative aims to provide extra support to the Armed Forces community at annual festive \"get-togethers\" across the charity's network, both at home and abroad. The royals placed commemorative sixpences into the mixture, ready to be found by those attending the gatherings next year.\n\nGeorge and his sister Princess Charlotte, four, made their public debut at the annual Christmas Day church service in December. The Prince looked smart in a navy blazer, jumper and trousers, while his sibling wore a dark green double-breasted coat from Amaia Kids.\n\nMake sure you never miss a ROYAL story!
