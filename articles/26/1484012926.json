If you are one of the lucky ones who can enjoy the sunny outdoors, be glad for the company.\n\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20): Friendliness is next to godliness. You are happy to spend time with neighbors and friends as well as family. Watching football or playing a friendly game in the back yard after a meal can bring out someone's competitive streak.\n\nGEMINI (May 21-June 20): Make a list and prioritize your goals so you can see a clear pattern. Use that pattern to create a resolution you can stick to easily. Accomplish something worthwhile and broaden your horizons by aiming for them resolutely.\n\nCANCER (June 21-July 22): A New Year's Day meal could be sauerkraut and pork, a turkey dinner with all the trimmings, or a pizza delivered to the door. It doesn't really matter what you eat, but it does matter who shares in your holiday togetherness.\n\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22): You can have fun whether you spend your day with family, football or food. Replace an alphabet soup of unrelated ideas with one strong, overriding objective when you make your new year's resolution. Give ambitions their head.\n\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Some people celebrate the first day of the new year, but to others it's just another day. Whether you work or not, this day could be more special than most. Your circle of friends can help you make smart resolutions.\n\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): You are the star of your own show. Whether your social circle is small or large, you'll have a great time sitting around the table or the TV. Make a resolution that reflects your commitment to making someone else happy.\n\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Congratulate the champion of the contest. You may compete with a loved one to see who can create the best surprises or offer the most unique New Year's Day entertainment. Make daily tasks a labor of love.\n\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Put your feet up and relax. Loved ones could cater to your every need or smother you with affection. The new year may be a good time to resolve to spend more time with people you know and trust.\n\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): New Year's Day may be spent watching spectator sports or participating in a sport outside in the fresh air. Either way, you could become passionate about the outcome because you are loyal to the bone.\n\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): A loved one may demonstrate a deeper level of understanding. Turn a page on the calendar as well as your feelings. Make a resolution to do some of the things you always wanted to do but were afraid to try.\n\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Wish everyone a happy new year with a brief call or visit. Your new year's resolutions might be to make sure that old acquaintances aren't forgotten. Someone who is the target of your romantic fantasies may grow closer.\n\nIF TODAY IS YOUR BIRTHDAY: You are still full of holiday spirit, so the next two to three weeks will be pleasurable indeed. Focus on making long-range plans while your judgment is at a high point. Embrace any opportunity or offer that comes your way, as it is sure to be worth your time and effort. In early February, focus on financial success while your business smarts are in peak condition. You might be more imaginative and romantic during March and April, but you could also be more gullible than usual. You might be distracted by outer appearances. If an opportunity appears, ask for advice from trusted friends or family before making a decision. In July, your daydreams could get in the way of doing what is important, so don't begin anything crucial. Wait until September to make major changes. That is an excellent time to transform your life by taking some giant steps while you have both the business skills and the imagination.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "ARIES (March 21-April 19): Your New Year's Day may be snowy, but there is plenty of warmth indoors with the people you love.
