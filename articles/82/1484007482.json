After that, we return to the present day, where we find the surviving members of the Abbott family searching for a new place to call home while they attempt to find more survivors. However, as Cillian Murphy's character points out, \"The people that are left, they're not the kind of people worth saving.\"\n\nRELATED: A Quiet Place: Part II Photo Reveals the Return of the Abbott Family\n\nA Quiet Place takes place in a world where humans are forced to live in complete and utter silence due to the existence of murderous creatures with no eyesight but an incredibly heightened sense of hearing. In the first film, Krasinski's Lee Abbott sacrificed himself by screaming to draw the attention of one of the creatures and allowing his family to retreat.\n\nWritten and directed by John Krasinski, A Quiet Place: Part II stars Emily Blunt, Djimon Hounsou, Noah Jupe, Millicent Simmonds and Cillian Murphy. The film hits theaters March 20, 2020.\n\nKEEP READING: A Quiet Place 2: Marvel/DC Star Djimon Hounsou Boards as Henry Exits\n\nShare Tweet Email Copy Link Copied", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["a quiet place 2", "A Quiet Place: Part II"], "authors": ["John Ridlehoover", "Meagan Damore", "Duane Richards"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 09:01:55 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The first full-length trailer for Paramount Pictures' A Quiet Place: Part II features a flashback to the onset of the monster invasion.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/public/build/images/favicon-32x32.8609a1c9.png", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "description": "The first full-length trailer for Paramount Pictures' A Quiet Place: Part II features a flashback to the onset of the monster invasion.", "og": {"title": "A Quiet Place: Part II Trailer Takes Things Back to the Beginning", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/quiet-place-2-poster-1.jpg", "width": 2400, "height": 1200}, "url": "https://www.cbr.com/a-quiet-place-part-2-full-trailer/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The first full-length trailer for Paramount Pictures' A Quiet Place: Part II features a flashback to the onset of the monster invasion.", "site_name": "CBR"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T09:01:55Z", "section": "Movies"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1754119328184357, "pages": 10765693196}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.cbr.com/a-quiet-place-part-2-full-trailer/"}
