Thereafter, he fixed the head of the goat onto the body of the cow and with a snap of his fingers uttered a mantra.\n\nThe animal sprang to life instantly and started grazing in the meadows. Lam Drukpa Kunley then named it the \u2018Dong Gyem Tsey\u2019 (Takin).\n\nWhere are takins found?\n\nThe takin found in Bhutan is actually one out of four sub-species. It is a large bovid ungulate found along the warm broad-leaved forests throughout the alpine region (between the altitudinal range of 1,200m in warm broadleaved forests to 5,374m in northern Bhutan).\n\nBhutan\u2019s takin migrates from alpine valleys to lower forests in autumn and return to the summer habitats in early spring.\n\nThe species has been reportedly seen in Xizang, China and Sikkim, as well as Arunachal Pradesh in India. Its population is estimated to be between 500-700 individuals.\n\nTakins are found in steep forests extending to the timberline and mountain valleys in the Eastern Himalayas as well as the adjoining mountain ranges of Bhutan, India, Myanmar, and China.\n\nMap: Research Gate/Tiger Sangay & Karl Vernes (Dec 2016)\n\nThe animal is mostly found in the Jigme Dorji National Park and Wangchuck Centennial National Park. However, the takin can also be seen roaming in the forest divisions of Bhutan\u2019s districts of Paro, Thimphu, and Wangdue.\n\nThe report also stated that the winter habitats of the takin were highly vulnerable to anthropogenic pressure due to its closer proximity to human settlements.\n\n\u201cBuilding roads closer to or within the takin habitats will not only alter the animal behaviour but will also fragment the habitats.\u201d\n\nRecommended solutions to mitigate negative impact of development on takins\n\nTo deter negative impact within their habitats, the study recommended that the government should focus on maintaining the existing farm roads rather than building new roads.\n\n\u201cIf a new construction is required, it should be cost-effective and environmentally less damaging.\u201d\n\nThe current method of \u2018cut-fill\u2019 construction involved high costs and is not environmentally friendly.\n\nExperts documented the indirect impact of such developments on wildlife such as: physical barrier for movement and dispersal as well as the displacement and change in habits.\n\nTakins generally prefer continuous gentle terrain and an undisturbed habitat for foraging, finding mates and for their long-term sustenance.\n\nTherefore, low-altitude forested habitats outside protected areas should be incorporated into the takin management plan. These forests should also be protected as takin habitats, according to the report.\n\nThreats to the existence of takins in Bhutan\n\nAs takins live in remote areas, far away from high-density human settlements, it increases poaching risk.\n\nMoreover, they are also susceptible to snaring, illegal trapping and disturbance from feral dogs.\n\nThe population of takins is found to be decreasing. This is attributed to threats from deforestation, habitat fragmentation, hunting, zoonotic disease transmission, and competition for food from domestic livestock.\n\nSteps have been taken to conserve the species. Bhutan's takin was declared the national animal of Bhutan in 1985 and is strictly protected under Schedule I of the Forests and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan 1995.\n\nIn addition, the takin has also been categorised as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 in the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List.\n\nThis article first appeared in Kuensel and has been edited for Daily Bhutan.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["bhutan nature", "Bhutan Wildlife", "divine madman", "Forests and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan 1995", "IUCN Red List of threatened species", "Jigme Dorji National Park", "Lam Drukpa Kunley", "nationa animal of bhutan", "negative impact of development on takins", "takin", "Threats to the existence of takins in Bhutan", "Wangchuck Centennial National Park"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ebizity Pte Ltd"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Takins are strictly protected under Schedule I of the Forests and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan 1995.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/images/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "bhutan nature, Bhutan Wildlife, divine madman, Forests and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan 1995, IUCN Red List of threatened species, Jigme Dorji National Park, Lam Drukpa Kunley, nationa animal of bhutan, negative impact of development on takins, takin, Threats to the existence of takins in Bhutan, Wangchuck Centennial National Park", "description": "Takins are strictly protected under Schedule I of the Forests and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan 1995.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "website", "title": "Mitigating Threats To Bhutan\u2019s Beloved National Animal - The Takin", "description": "Takins are strictly protected under Schedule I of the Forests and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan 1995.", "url": "http://dailybhutan.com/article/mitigating-threats-to-bhutan-s-beloved-national-animal-the-takin", "image": "https://dailybhutan.com/pub_files/01020100205880/mitigating-threats-to-bhutan-s-beloved-national-animal-the-takin_7007.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "http://dailybhutan.com/article/mitigating-threats-to-bhutan-s-beloved-national-animal-the-takin", "title": "Mitigating Threats To Bhutan\u2019s Beloved National Animal - The Takin", "description": "Takins are strictly protected under Schedule I of the Forests and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan 1995.", "image": "https://dailybhutan.com/pub_files/01020100205880/mitigating-threats-to-bhutan-s-beloved-national-animal-the-takin_7007.jpg"}, "smartbanner": {"title": "Daily Bhutan on Mobile", "author": "by eBizity Pte Ltd", "price": "FREE", "price-suffix-apple": "- On the App Store", "price-suffix-google": "- In Google Play", "icon-apple": "/images/logo-bhutan-app_19117.png", "icon-google": "/images/logo-bhutan-app_19117.png", "button": "VIEW", "button-url-apple": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bhutantimes/id1342977013?ls=1&mt=8", "button-url-google": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bhutantimes.app", "enabled-platforms": "android,ios"}}, "canonical_link": "http://dailybhutan.com/article/mitigating-threats-to-bhutan-s-beloved-national-animal-the-takin"}
