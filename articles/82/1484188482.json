Cecelia Health\n\n\u201cI had no energy, and when I stepped on the scale I was 30 pounds lighter than I expected,\u201d Weingard said. \u201cI was in shock, overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nNormally Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed at a much younger age than Weingard was at the time, but a small percentage of people are diagnosed later in life. No one knows the reason for the later onset of the disease, according to Weingard.\n\nWeingard\u2019s next shock came as he tried to find advice and support. Weingard was born and raised in Manhattan, where he still lives.\n\n\u201cI went to the local hospital and was told the next diabetes training was months away,\u201d Weingard said. \u201cI was fortunte to meet a great clinician named Cecelia Born-Cort, who gave me support and compassion, and inspired me.\u201d\n\nBorn-Cort was a Diabetes Educator Clinician at Lighthouse Guild, a non-profit on West 64th Street in New York City dedicated to preventing vision loss, a common symptom of uncontrolled diabetes. Like most nurses, Born-Cort was overbooked. What made her special, Weingard said, is that she knew how important it was to help him understand and deal with his Type 1 diabetes. She made the time to fit him into her schedule.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chronic, progressive disease,\u201d Weingard said. \u201cPeople get diagnosed and don\u2019t realize if they don\u2019t take the medications, or take care of themselves, there\u2019s a high probability of a heart attack, going blind, or losing a limb.\u201d\n\nCecelia Born-Cort, the Diabetes Educator Clinician who helped David Weingard, CEO of Cecelia Health. Cecelia Health\n\nWeingard worked for Microsoft in business development at the time he was diagnosed. He was also a competitive runner and cyclist, entering Ironman competitions. Inspired by Cecelia, he decided in 2008 to leave his job at Microsoft and launch a business that would deliver the kind of help she gave him to hundreds of thousands of people across the country by leveraging technology.\n\nWeingard named his company for Cecelia after learning she had passed away from cancer. He was able to track down her son in Atlanta, and on the company website there\u2019s a four-minute video of an interview with him about his mother and the company she inspired.\n\nIn order to maximize the impact of Cecelia Health, Weingard realized he needed to work with pharmaceutical companies and insurance health plans. These companies pay a monthly subscription to Cecelia Health to reach out to diabetes patients and establish a level of trust that results in improved outcomes.\n\nWeingard knew that 50 percent of patients prescribed diabetes medications don\u2019t get their prescriptions filled and initiate treatment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem for these pharmaceutical companies, and obviously a problem for patients,\u201d Weingard said.\n\nCecelia Health has 250 clinicians who work with diabetes patients in whatever way is going to be most effective. They make it clear to patients that they are there for them whenever they\u2019re needed, that they\u2019re not going away, and that they\u2019ll fit into their lives in whatever way works. If it\u2019s best to call after the kids have gone to bed, or whenever the patient is not at work, Cecelia Health\u2019s clinicians will do it.\n\n\u201cI want to be able to bring a form of Cecelia to everyone with diabetes on the planet,\u201d Weingard said. \u201cThat form can be human, it could be a video, it could be electronic through email, in every language, whatever way people need it.\u201d\n\nThe need for the kind of intervention Cecelia Health is providing is critical. At the end of 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 84 million Americans, roughly one-third of the population, are prediabetic, with higher than normal blood sugar levels, and are on their way to developing full-blown Type 2 diabetes.\n\nCecelia Health CEO David Weingard is a competitive triathlete, which he says helps him deal with his ... [+] Type 1 diabetes. Cecelia Health\n\nAs of 2015, there were about 30 million Americans with diabetes, with an additional 1.5 million people being diagnosed with the disease every year, according to the American Diabetes Association. Weingard points out there are not nearly enough endocrinologists to go around.\n\n\u201cThere are only 3,000 endocrinologists, and most of them are on the East and West coasts,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the math works. The center of the country is a vacuum. We\u2019ll be able to help.\u201d\n\nThe next big step for Cecelia Health, Weingard said, is to become a provider in every state so the company\u2019s clinicians can write prescriptions and adjust medications \u2013 essentially a diabetes telemedicine company. He expects to have the legal framework in place some time late in 2020, and by 2021 to be able to go international.\n\n\u201cThis mode is virtual, so we can easily do that,\u201d Weingard said. \u201cWe\u2019re already handling multiple languages.\u201d\n\nWeingard himself, at 56 years old, continues to compete in triathlons. Most days he gets in a 25-mile bicycle ride in Central Park before going to work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you for me getting up and doing that makes me feel I\u2019m beating diabetes,\u201d Weingard said. \u201cI\u2019m not that fast, but I\u2019m taking care of myself. I changes my whole sense of empowerment.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Daniel D'Ambrosio"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 29 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "David Weingard, CEO and founder of Cecelia Health, traces the beginning of his company to the day, at 36 years old, he walked into a doctor\u2019s office and was told he had Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=2,user-scalable=yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "og": {"site_name": "Forbes", "title": "Diabetic CEO Builds His Business To Help Others Deal With The Disease", "image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5e09611dab5be60007628cb4%2F960x0.jpg", "updated_time": "2019-12-29T21:45:51-05:00", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/danieldambrosio/2020/12/29/diabetic-ceo-builds-his-business-to-help-others-deal-with-the-disease/", "description": "David Weingard, CEO and founder of Cecelia Health, traces the beginning of his company to the day, at 36 years old, he walked into a doctor\u2019s office and was told he had Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes.", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@forbes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Diabetic CEO Builds His Business To Help Others Deal With The Disease", "description": "David Weingard, CEO and founder of Cecelia Health, traces the beginning of his company to the day, at 36 years old, he walked into a doctor\u2019s office and was told he had Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes.", "image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x300/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5e09611dab5be60007628cb4%2F960x0.jpg", "creator": "@danieldambrosio"}, "description": "David Weingard, CEO and founder of Cecelia Health, traces the beginning of his company to the day, at 36 years old, he walked into a doctor\u2019s office and was told he had Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes.", "author": "Daniel D'Ambrosio", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes", "author": "Daniel D'Ambrosio", "section": "Small Business", "section_url": "https://www.forbes.com/entrepreneurs/", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/6020-5e095f9b14d9950007892c69", "published": "2019-12-30", "modified": "2019-12-30"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/danieldambrosio/2020/12/29/diabetic-ceo-builds-his-business-to-help-others-deal-with-the-disease/"}
