      HIGH COURT OF CHHATTISGARH, BILASPUR

                   MCRC No. 8032 of 2019

    Satyendra Kumar Sarthi @ Chotu S/o Shiv Prasad Aged
     About 21 Years R/o Village Belbhata Gidha, Police Station
     and Tahsil Kharsia, District Raigarh Chhattisgarh.

                        Order On Board

02/01/2020

</p><p id="p_2">  1. Heard.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">  2. This is the fifth application for grant of regular bail to the

     applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">  3. The first application, MCRC No.4657/2017, was dismissed

     as withdrawn with a direction for expediting the trial of the

     case. The second application, MCRC No.4819/2017, was

     again dismissed as withdrawn on the same date i.e.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>
                                            MCRC No. 8032 of 2019

   01.09.2017. The third application, MCRC No.1702/2018,

   was again dismissed as withdrawn on 08.05.2018. The

   fourth application was filed by the applicant on medical

   ground and the same was also withdrawn on 25.02.2019. It

   is submitted that not a single earlier application of this

   applicant has been decided on merits.


</p><p id="p_7">4. The applicant is in jail since 20.03.2017. He has no criminal

   antecedent and the trial against him is getting delayed. So

   far out of 21 witnesses listed in the charge-sheet only 11

   have been examined, therefore, it is prayed by learned

   counsel for the applicant that this application should be

   allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5. Learned counsel for the State submitted that there is

   evidence present against the applicant regarding his

   involvement in commission of crime, therefore, he is not

   entitled for grant of bail.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">6. According to the prosecution case on the date of incident

   this applicant along with co accused persons forcibly

   abducted the complainant and then by taking him to a place,

   the complainant was thrashed and his possessions i.e. cash

   and other things were looted from him.


</p><p id="p_12">7. Considering that this applicant has not any criminal

   antecedent and further considering that he has undergone
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>

        detention for a period about 2 years and 10 months and the

        trial against him is still pending, therefore, for these reasons

        I feel inclined to allow this application.


</p><p id="p_13">    8. Accordingly, the application is allowed and the applicant is

        directed to be released on bail on his executing a personal

        bond for a sum of Rs.25,000/- with one surety for the like

        amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court. He is directed to

        appear before the trial Court on each an every date given by

        the said Court.
