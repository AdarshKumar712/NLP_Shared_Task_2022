No one should interfere with or attack police officers who are maintaining law and order at mining sites. Anyone who decides or attempts to disarm police officers on duty risks being shot.\u201d\n\nMatanga said police were working with other stakeholders to ensure that incidences of gold rush in several parts of the country are swiftly dealt with.\n\n\u201cLet us all promote law and order and engage in lawful and regularized mining activities. Regulating authorities will be issuing out prohibition orders barring he carrying of machetes and other weapons such as knives, catapults, iron bars and knobkerries\u2026\u201d\n\nThe police chief said he will ensure that police deployments in mining areas are influenced by the need to protect and preserve life and property.\n\n\u201cMy office will therefore not stand by and allow unruly elements to attack police officers. We have also engaged the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development to ensure that all mining disputes, disused and decommissioned mines are monitored and measures put in place to curtail illegal mining activities,\u201d he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.zimeye.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/zimeye.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.zimeye.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/machetes-360x200.jpg"}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.zimeye.net/2020/01/01/police-announce-blitz-on-illegal-gold-miners-following-murder-of-one-of-their-own/"}
