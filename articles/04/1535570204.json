(File Photo) CPI General Secretary D Raja. (File Photo)\n\nCPI general secretary D Raja speaks to Manoj C G on the Delhi government\u2019s decision to sanction Kanhaiya Kumar\u2019s prosecution\n\nWere you surprised by the Arvind Kejriwal government\u2019s decision to give prosecution sanction to Delhi Police in the sedition case against CPI national executive member and former JNU students\u2019 union president Kanhaiya Kumar and nine others?\n\nThe way Arvind Kejriwal is presenting his politics is surprising. Kejriwal had said in 2016 that these videos are all doctored. Suddenly, how he relied upon the evidence? What is this change of mind and change of politics? More than surprising, it raises questions about Kejriwal. We are confident that Kanhaiya Kumar will come out unscathed as the charges are false and politically motivated. It is unfortunate that the Kejriwal government has succumbed to political pressure and granted permission to prosecute Kanhaiya.\n\nRead | Kanhaiya Kumar calls for speedy trial after Delhi govt\u2019s nod for prosecution\n\nHow will this move impact Opposition unity. The AAP, for instance, was a signatory to the letter CPI(M), CPI and some Opposition parties wrote to the President on Friday over the situation in Delhi?\n\nIt seems Aam Aadmi Party is not united. That is what I understand. A case has been registered against their own man (councillor Tahir Hussain). I think there are differences in the AAP.\n\nThe AAP had maintained silence on the anti-CAA protests during the Assembly election. Now its government has given the go-ahead. How do you see it?\n\nExactly. It raises several questions. This political eclecticism \u2014 on one side Bharat Mata Ki Jai and Vande Mataram and on the other, Inquilab Zindabad \u2014 will not survive. Temporarily, Kejriwal may think it gives him advantage but it would not last. The chief minister, as I said, has in the beginning said that there is no case of sedition against Kanhaiya and the videos were doctored. We are yet to ascertain why this sudden change of heart has happened.\n\nThe Delhi government\u2019s standing counsel had advised against giving police the go-ahead just seven months ago?\n\nThat is what we have come to know. We are seeking that report also. We will release it to the media to prove our claim. Moreover, sedition (Act) is a colonial law. In 2011, when I was in Parliament, I had moved a private member\u2019s Bill, seeking deletion of the sedition law from our statute.\n\nHow do you plan to fight the case?\n\nWe will fight, legally and politically. We don\u2019t have a problem. Communists cannot be intimidated like this. We fought against the British.\n\nWe were the first party to face conspiracy and sedition cases under British rule. Even when my party was founded in 1925\u2026 Kanpur conspiracy case was put\u2026 many leaders could not reach Kanpur for attending the first Congress\u2026 but our party was founded. And our party was at the forefront of the freedom movement. There was the Meerut conspiracy case\u2026 the Madurai conspiracy case\u2026 the Tirunelveli conspiracy case\u2026 Communist party faced many conspiracy and sedition cases during the British rule\u2026.we could fight the British raj, now we will fight the BJP raj.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
