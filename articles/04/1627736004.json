NASA said the moon will appear full for about three days, from early Thursday morning into early Sunday morning.\n\nWhile the full moon will be a sight in and of itself, celestial watchers will be treated to an accompanying partial eclipse of the moon on Friday, depending on where they live.\n\nUnfortunately for those in North America, the penumbral lunar eclipse won\u2019t be visible because the moon becomes full during daylight hours when it\u2019s below the horizon.\n\nFor observers in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, however, the moon will appear ever-so-slightly darker than normal as it passes through the outer edge of Earth\u2019s shadow (the penumbra). The dimming effect won\u2019t be as a dramatic as a total eclipse and will be difficult to detect for the casual watcher staring up at the sky.\n\nThe partial penumbral eclipse of the moon will occur on Friday afternoon at 3:12 p.m. Eastern.\n\nAlthough moon-gazers in North America won\u2019t be able to witness the partial eclipse in person, they can still livestream the lunar event thanks to the Virtual Telescope Project, which will stream the view above Rome\u2019s skyline in Italy beginning at 3 p.m. Eastern.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["canadian news live", "canada", "news", "ctv news", "breaking news", "canadian", "local news", "weather", "breaking news", "ottawa", "politics", "covid 19 canada", "covid 19", "coronavirus canada", ""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Jun  5 09:04:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A Strawberry Moon will rise on Friday and pass through part of the shadow of the Earth in what is called a partial penumbral eclipse of the moon.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//static.ctvnews.ca/bellmedia/ctvnews/img/fav-icons-2019/57x57-CTVNews-Icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Strawberry Moon will rise on Friday and pass through part of the shadow of the Earth in what is called a partial penumbral eclipse of the moon.", "keywords": "canadian news live, canada, news, ctv news, breaking news, canadian, local news, weather, breaking news, ottawa, politics,  covid 19 canada, covid 19, coronavirus canada,", "news_keywords": "Strawberry Moon, NASA, lunar eclipse, partial penumbral eclipse, full moon, Earth's shadow, space,", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "fb": {"pages": 189363054419794}, "dc.date.modified": "2020-06-05", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Here's how to watch the 'Strawberry Moon Eclipse' on Friday", "description": "A Strawberry Moon will rise on Friday and pass through part of the shadow of the Earth in what is called a partial penumbral eclipse of the moon.", "url": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/here-s-how-to-watch-the-strawberry-moon-eclipse-on-friday-1.4970737", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4970741.1591360640!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg", "site_name": "CTVNews", "locale": "en_CA"}, "twitter": {"title": "Here's how to watch the 'Strawberry Moon Eclipse' on Friday", "url": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/here-s-how-to-watch-the-strawberry-moon-eclipse-on-friday-1.4970737", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A Strawberry Moon will rise on Friday and pass through part of the shadow of the Earth in what is called a partial penumbral eclipse of the moon.", "site": "@CTVNews", "creator": "@CTVNews", "image": {"src": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4970741.1591360640!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-06-05T09:04:00-04:00", "section": "Sci-Tech"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/here-s-how-to-watch-the-strawberry-moon-eclipse-on-friday-1.4970737"}
