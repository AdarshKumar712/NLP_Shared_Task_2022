I share the title of my mother\u2019s home with my stepfather, but he wants to get married again and wants his new wife to move into the house. What happens when he dies? Does she have any right to the house or can I kick her out immediately after he dies?\n\nVanessa\n\nDear Vanessa,\n\nGiven that he\u2019s about to have another chance at love and in the holiday spirit and interest of decorum, let\u2019s start by wishing them the best in their new lives together and hope they both live long and happy lives. It\u2019s nice that he doesn\u2019t have to be alone anymore and is able to share the remainder of his life with a woman he loves.\n\nAlso see:As a baby boomer, I didn\u2019t grow up with this culture of entitlement \u2014 do I have to leave my estate to my children or spouse?\n\nIf you and your stepfather\u2019s names are listed on the title deeds of your mother\u2019s former home, he owns 50%. His new wife would be his legal heir and, for better or for worse, you would end up owning the house with this woman. If he is a tenant for life, then the 50% of your mother\u2019s former home would pass to you when he dies, assuming you are an only child.\n\nRecommended: \u2018What did he do with all the money?\u2019 My dying husband cashed his $700K life insurance and emptied his bank accounts\n\nIn the meantime, I would like to gently suggest welcoming your stepfather\u2019s new wife into your lives as a member of your extended family. Try, if you can, to put this territorial approach to one side for now. You don\u2019t know this woman. What if she is warm and caring and wants for nothing except the love and support of her husband and his family?\n\nDon\u2019t miss: I discovered through Ancestry.com that my biological father is someone else \u2014 can I claim an inheritance as his heir?\n\nAt the very least, it will help the years pass without rancor and bitterness. If he invites you to the wedding, raise a glass to their health and happiness. Who knows, they may enrich your life in ways you could not have imagined and that go beyond the half share of your mother\u2019s property. You may even find yourself wishing that they both stick around for a very long time.\n\nRead also: \u2018My husband\u2019s kids hate me and refused to come to our wedding, yet he is leaving them all his property.\u2019 How can I negotiate to secure my future?\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?
