I\u2019d love to try the case,\u201d Giuliani told reporters as he made his way into a New Year\u2019s Eve celebration at the president\u2019s Florida resort on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody would have the courage to give me the case, but if you give me the case, I will prosecute it as a racketeering case, which I kind of invented anyway,\u201d he said, referring to his pioneering use of racketeering laws to take down New York mob leadership in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cIt was 30 years ago, but let\u2019s see if I can still do it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former New York City mayor did not elaborate, but he has said before that Trump did nothing wrong in the dealings with Ukraine that led to his impeachment, and that the real wrongdoers are former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.\n\nThe impeachment proceedings center on Trump\u2019s efforts to press Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the Bidens, focusing on Hunter Biden\u2019s work on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was calling for the removal the country\u2019s top prosecutor as part of the Obama administration\u2019s anti-corruption efforts there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m great at it. It\u2019s what I do best as a lawyer. That\u2019s what I would be good at,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, I would love it, I could rip \u2014 you know, I hate to sound like a ridiculously boastful lawyer, but cross-examining them would be, I don\u2019t know, I could\u2019ve done it when I was a second-year assistant U.S. attorney. They\u2019re a bunch of clowns.\u201d\n\nDirect link to video\u2026", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Juan Motime", "Toxic Male", "Tiny Hope", "Williard Lumpkin"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 03:38:17 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "America's Front Page For Political News", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "description": "America's Front Page For Political News", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "VERY interesting comment from Giuliani (raw)\u2026", "url": "https://www.citizenfreepress.com/breaking/very-interesting-comment-from-giuliani-raw/", "description": "Quick hit from Rudy last night at the Mar-a-Lago party\u2026 \u00a0 President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani says he\u2019d be willing to testify at his client\u2019s \u2026", "site_name": "CITIZEN FREE PRESS", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.citizenfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rudy-giuliani.jpg", "width": 1151, "height": 625}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-02T03:38:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T05:23:18+00:00"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@TheDailyBail", "text": {"title": "VERY interesting comment from Giuliani (raw)\u2026"}, "card": "summary"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.citizenfreepress.com/breaking/very-interesting-comment-from-giuliani-raw/"}
