Operating earnings excluding financial items such as interest and taxes shrank by 81% to 0.9 billion euros from 4.8 billion euros ($5.2 billion) a year earlier.\n\nThe company said Wednesday that despite the disruption from the virus it remained financially strong with what it termed a \u201crobust\u201d cash pile of 17.8 billion euros ($19 billion). Sales revenue fell by 8.3% to 55.1 billion euros.\n\nChief Financial Officer Frank Witter said in a statement that \u201cthe global COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted our business in the first quarter. We\u2019ve taken numerous countermeasures to cut costs and ensure liquidity and we continue to be robustly positioned financially. The Volkswagen Group is steering through this unprecedented crisis with focus and determination.\u201d\n\nThe quarter was marked by the shutdown of the company's plants due to the virus outbreak. Production has re-started in China and is being brought back online in Europe. Auto dealerships have reopened in major markets China and Germany.\n\nThere were a few bright spots, such as the company's high-end Porsche division seeing an increase in sales revenue due a higher share of more profitable models in the sales mix, though earnings at the division declined to 529 million euros from 829 million euros.\n\nThe company on Monday re-started production at its plant in Wolfsburg, Germany where the company is headquartered, making the Golf model and running at about 10-15% of normal. The pace was expected to rise to 40% next week.\n\nVolkswagen said the group as a whole would make an operating profit for the year but that earnings would be \u201cseverely below\u201d last year's.\n\nBesides Volkswagen, the company brands include Audi, Porsche, SEAT, Skoda and Lamborghini.\n\nThank you for reading the Springfield News-Sun and for supporting local journalism.
