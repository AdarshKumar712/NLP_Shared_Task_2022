Confetti fell from the skies as revelers sang along to Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cNew York, New York.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump, celebrating the new year in Florida at his Mar-a-Lago resort, took to Twitter to post \u201cHAPPY NEW YEAR!\u201d\n\nIn Moscow, celebrants enjoyed unseasonably warm weather as they jammed Red Square for a fireworks display over the Kremlin.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin delivered his traditional new year\u2019s greeting just moments before the clock struck midnight, saying, \u201cAs we look forward with excitement to the chiming of the bells, we believe and hope that all our wishes are bound to come true.\u201d\n\nIn London, fireworks lit up the sky above the London Eye observation wheel on the River Thames as tens of thousands looked on.\n\nCrowds in Paris filled the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es to watch fireworks soar over the specially-illuminated Arc de Triomphe as lasers shot from the historic arch.\n\nRevelers in Pyongyang, North Korea, celebrated with music and dancing in Kim Il Sung square.\n\nIn Brazil, fireworks rose over Rio de Janeiro\u2019s famous Copacabana beach as an estimated two million people jammed the shore and the surrounding area.\n\nRevelers in Seattle, however, had to make due with a much quieter celebration, as high winds delayed the fireworks display that organizers had planned for the city\u2019s Space Needle observation tower. When the clock struck midnight, celebrants were instead treated to a laser light show set to music.\n\nIn Rome, pilgrims crowded St. Peter\u2019s Square to greet the Pope Francis, who called for kindness and understanding in his New Year\u2019s Eve address.\n\nGod \u201cdelights in seeing how many acts of good are done every day,\u201d the pope said. \u201cWe are called to encounter others and to listen to their existence, their cry for help. Listening is already an act of love.\u201d\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020, ABC Audio.
