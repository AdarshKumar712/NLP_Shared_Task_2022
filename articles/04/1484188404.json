They work for a company that has a contract to manufacture a locomotive.\n\nThis is a highly complex piece of equipment.\n\nOn one level, workers are required to make the components to spec. Then they must put them all together. These tasks are formidable.\n\nOn another level, various departments of the company must coordinate their efforts. This is also viewed as a technological job. Organizing is considered a technology.\n\nWhen the locomotive is finished and delivered, and when it runs on its tracks and pulls a train, a great and inspiring victory is won.\n\nAnd then...the engineers begin to think about the implications.\n\nSuppose the locomotive was society itself? Suppose society was the finished product? Couldn't society be put together in a coordinated fashion? And couldn't the \"technology of organizing things\" be utilized for the job?\n\nWhy bother with endlessly arguing and lying politicians? Why should they be in charge? Isn't that an obvious losing proposition? Of course it is.\n\nBut engineers could lay out and build a future society that would benefit all people. Hunger, disease, and poverty could be wiped out. Eliminating them would be part of the uncompromising blueprint.\n\nThis \"insight\" hit engineers and technicians like a ton of bricks. Of course! All societies had been failures for the same reason: the wrong people were in charge.\n\nArmed with this new understanding, engineers of every stripe began to see what was needed. A revolution in thinking about societal organization. Science was the new king. And science would rule.\n\nOf course, for an engineered world to work, certain decisions would have to be made about the role of the individual. Every individual. You couldn't have an air-tight plan if every human were free to pursue his own objectives. Too many variables. Too much confusion. Too much conflict. Well, that problem could be solved. The individual's actions would be tailored to fit the coordinated operations of the planned society.\n\nThe individual would be inserted into a pre-ordained slot. He would be \"one of the components of the locomotive.\" His life would be connected to other lives to produce an exemplary shape.\n\nNext Page 1 | 2", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Belief", "Globalism", "People", "Population", "Technocracy", "Technocrats"], "tags": ["Population", "Globalism", "People", "Technocracy", "Belief", "Technocrats"], "authors": ["Jon Rappoport"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Article: A deeper understanding of technocracy - Globalists saw technocracy as a system they could use to control the population.
