Ld. Vijay Karnik from my upcoming directorial film #BhujThePrideOfIndia . #14Aug2020.\u201d He also revealed that the film will open in theatres a day before Independence Day this year. Ajay plays the lead role and will be seen as Squadron Leader Vijay Karnik.\n\nIt\u2019s a privilege to present @ajaydevgn sir\u2019s first look as Sq. Ld.

The period drama looks back into the journey of 300 women from Madhapar village of Gujarat\u2019s Kutch district, who played a pivotal role in helping India win the war. The women came together to rebuild and repair the only runway in Bhuj, which was crucial for the war.\n\nAlso read: Ananya Panday equates struggle to not appearing on Koffee With Karan, Siddhant Chaturvedi has a savage reply\n\nThe film also stars Sanjay Dutt, Sonakshi Sinha, Hate Story 4 actor Ihana Dhillon, singer-actor Ammy Virk and South Indian actor Pranitha Subhash. For Pranitha, who has starred in a number of movies such Porki, Saguni and Dynamite, Bhuj: The Pride of India will also mark her Bollywood debut.\n\nSpeaking about working with Ajay Devgn, she had earlier told IANS: \u201cAjay sir is so disciplined on sets. He is so natural when it comes to acting and the best thing about him is that as soon as the director says action, he gets into the character and gets out of it as soon as the director says cut. There was so much to learn from him and I feel blessed to have worked with him in my first Bollywood film.\u201d The film is slated to hit theatres on August 14.\n\n(With IANS inputs)\n\nFollow @htshowbiz for more", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Bhuj The Pride of India", "Bhuj The Pride of India Ajay Devgn", "Bhuj The Pride of India first look", "Bollywood", "Sanjay Dutt", "Sonakshi Sinha"], "tags": ["Ajay Devgn", "Bhuj The Pride of India", "India"], "authors": ["Ht Correspondent"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 09:59:28 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Ajay Devgn\u2019s first look from director Abhishek Dudhaiya\u2019s film Bhuj: The Pride of India is out.
