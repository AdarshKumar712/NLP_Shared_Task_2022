Laschet is widely seen as the continuity candidate.\n\nGerman magazine Focus reported that Spahn would run as Laschet's deputy.\n\nMerkel, chancellor of Europe's biggest economy for almost 15 years, has said she will not run again in the next federal election, due by Oct. 2021. It is unclear if she will be able to remain chancellor until then with a new party leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer has stressed that the party's top brass expected the winner of the leadership contest to work alongside Merkel.\n\nFriedrich Merz, on the right of the party and a long-time archrival of Merkel, is also expected to stand at a news conference later on Tuesday morning.\n\nLast week, Norbert Roettgen, head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, unexpectedly joined the leadership race.\n\nThe new CDU leader is in a strong position to be the conservative bloc's candidate for chancellor in the next election, although Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU) also have a big say. They may prefer to put forward their own leader, Markus Soeder.\n\nThe CDU plans to pick a new leader at a special congress on Apr 25, an attempt to resolve a crisis that is shaking the party's hold on power.\n\nThe conservative bloc currently rules in coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD).\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Angela Merkel", "Jens Spahn", "CDU", "news and
