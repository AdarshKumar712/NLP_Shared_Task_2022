This is an area where each and every one of us has to take personal responsibility.\u201d\n\nHe said binary views on Brexit and Scottish independence had \u201cundoubtedly contributed to the toxicity of the political debate\u201d, and hoped the absence of a scheduled election in 2020 would make the atmosphere \u201ca little less febrile\u201d.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 15:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A SENIOR Tory MSP has called for a ban on anonymous social media accounts to help clean the \u201ccesspit\u201d of abuse faced by politicians online.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/resources/images/5752176/", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "OMG-Verify-V1": "4389-366acdfc-5224-4c07-bb70-f74d8fbfc2db", "og": {"url": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18132003.msp-demands-end-anonymous-social-media-help-stem-torrent-abuse/", "site_name": "HeraldScotland", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9369125/", "width": 2400, "height": 1601}, "title": "MSP demands end to anonymous social media to help stem \u2018torrent\u2019 of abuse", "type": "website", "name": "MSP demands end to anonymous social media to help stem \u2018torrent\u2019 of abuse", "description": "A SENIOR Tory MSP has called for a ban on anonymous social media accounts to help clean the \u201ccesspit\u201d of abuse faced by politicians online."}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9369125/"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "MSP demands end to anonymous social media to help stem \u2018torrent\u2019 of abuse", "description": "A SENIOR Tory MSP has called for a ban on anonymous social media accounts to help clean the \u201ccesspit\u201d of abuse faced by politicians online."}, "fb": {"app_id": 612240812916784, "pages": 285985008233564}, "medium": "news", "title": "MSP demands end to anonymous social media to help stem \u2018torrent\u2019 of abuse", "description": "A SENIOR Tory MSP has called for a ban on anonymous social media accounts to help clean the \u201ccesspit\u201d of abuse faced by politicians online."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18132003.msp-demands-end-anonymous-social-media-help-stem-torrent-abuse/"}
