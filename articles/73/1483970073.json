John M. Lieb.\n\nLieb said the three victims were injured in their legs or lower part of their bodies and are expected to survive. No arrests have been made.\n\nCircumstances of the shooting remained unclear Tuesday morning, but Lieb said investigators do not believe the attack was random. He said \u201cthere are no ongoing threats to the public.\u201d\n\nLieb said detectives were investigating two crime scenes. One was a breezeway in the hotel, and the other was in the parking lot outside. He said investigators are trying to determine where the shots were fired. He said a firearm was recovered in the parking lot.\n\nIt was unclear if all three victims had been shot or if some were injured in another way during the incident. Lieb said detectives were trying to determine if the victims knew each other.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["leesburg pike", "tysons corner", "arrests", "hotel", "law and order", "crime"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
