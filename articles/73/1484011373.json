We\u2019re committed to stopping the devastating effects of the climate crisis on people and nature by supporting Friends of the Earth. Join us here.\n\n\u2018Eco-anxiety\u2019 is not a clinical diagnosis, nor is it a disorder. But it is a very real concern that\u2019s impacting people\u2019s lives right now. With the Amazon forest burning, animal species disappearing, coral reefs dying out, more extreme weather events and glaciers melting rapidly, it\u2019s understandable that people are worried. In the words of 16-year-old climate change activist Greta Thunberg: \u201cOur house is on fire.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Associated Press / Brasil2 via Getty Images Eco-anxiety is on the rise, particularly among young people. Eco-anxiety, or climate change anxiety, can cause sleepless nights, intense bouts of worry and, in severe instances, may also lead to drastic shifts in people\u2019s behaviour. Experts have to HuffPost UK there\u2019s been a rise in the number of people coming to them with environmental concerns over the past two years (a trend which only seems to be getting worse as the headlines on climate change grow more shocking) \u2013 and with the UN warning that we have 11 years to make a change before it\u2019s too late. Earlier this week a group of psychologists from The Climate Psychology Alliance (CPA) told The Telegraph eco-anxiety among children \u201cescalated\u201d over the summer. The organisation is now campaigning for it to be recognised as a psychological phenomenon, however caveated that it shouldn\u2019t be classed as a mental illness as the worry is a \u201crational\u201d one. \u00a9 ASSOCIATED PRESS Greta Thunberg. Ahead of the Global Climate Strike on Friday 20 September \u2013 which is set to be the biggest yet with both adults and children taking part \u2013 here\u2019s what you need to know about eco-anxiety and why taking action might actually help you tackle it.\n\nWhat is eco-anxiety?\n\n\u00a9 DisobeyArt via Getty ImagesWhat does it look like?\n\nEco-anxiety can lead to people overthinking and catastrophising about the future. It can be triggered by almost anything, suggests Burke, who works with adults aged 20-50 years old and is a BACP member \u2013 from seeing something in the news to engaging in a debate with a friend about eating meat. One of her clients was triggered by seeing colleagues at work coming in with plastic bags full of food and not recycling them. She had calculated that her small office was one of millions of other offices likely doing the same, and had begun to catastrophise about the huge amount of waste and plastic on our planet. It left her in tears in the therapy room. ____________________________________________________ More on our Empowering the Planet campaign: Make a donation to help our cause Sign our petition to help prevent plastic in the ocean Learn how you can ask UK parliament to stop climate change ____________________________________________________ This type of anxiety can also make people become compulsive in the behaviours they adopt to try and do their bit for the planet. Natasha Crowe has seen this in practice a lot. New mums in particular can become compulsive about their daily behaviours, she explains, \u201cso constantly recycling or making sure they\u2019re using eco wipes and eco nappies, and really trying to drill down on the daily impact that they\u2019re making.\u201d One of her clients commutes for work and has stopped driving to the office. Now he gets a bus to work, which takes him longer \u2013 an hour and a half in total. It\u2019s all about taking back control for these people, but when these changes impact on wellbeing, or have a negative impact on a person\u2019s life, it\u2019s time to take a step back. Catastrophic thoughts can be dangerous, as they can lead to \u201ca sense of helplessness\u201d and can be \u201cimmobilising\u201d, says Burke. You end up thinking: what\u2019s the point? But there are solutions.\n\n\u00a9 boonchai wedmakawand via Getty ImagesWhat can you do?", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Eco-Anxiety Is On The Rise.
