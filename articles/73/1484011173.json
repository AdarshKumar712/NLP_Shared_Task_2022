On Tuesday, the artwork was returned to a police station outside of Quebec City.\n\nThe caf\u00e9-bar's manager, Caroline Marois, said the alleged thieves are not from the area.\n\nThey have apologized for the theft, she said \u2014 just in the nick of time, as her next step was to publish their faces on social media.\n\nMarois said the young people who frequent her establishment on Saint-Jean Street sometimes get drunk and make bad decisions, without thinking about the long-term consequences.\n\nThere may still be consequences, as the artist did file his own complaint with police Monday.\n\nPaquet told CBC News that he will withdraw that complaint once he confirms the art, priced at around $160 per drawing, was undamaged.\n\nHaving a computer or a bicycle stolen is one thing, he said, but it's a whole other experience when something he created \u2014 something into which he invested time and effort \u2014 is taken.\n\nArtist 'very happy' to have work back\n\nPaquet is a web designer, photographer and musician. He also draws, and he spent years on the work he had on display in La Ninkasi.\n\nHe said he was proud to finally hang it in the exhibition \u2014 and subsequently shocked when four of his pieces went missing.\n\nThe art was returned Tuesady, the day after the artist reported it stolen to Quebec City police. The manager of La Ninkasi says her cameras recorded every detail of the theft. (Facebook)\n\nHe applauded Marois for her effort to get the art back.\n\nThe photos of the missing frames and text sent a powerful message, and \"they were shared more than 300 times,\" he said. \"The dozens of comments were nice, also.\"\n\nHe said it's important to him, too, that the alleged thieves are aware of the impact they had \u2014 that it makes no sense to steal. If they show remorse, he said he'll forgive them. It makes no sense for them to have to live the rest of their lives with a criminal record, he said.\n\nOnce he gets the art back, it will be returned to the walls of La Ninkasi in the coming days.\n\nPaquet said he is \"very happy\" to know he will soon be reunited with his work.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cbc News"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The art was turned over to police after the alleged thieves were served a thinly veiled threat of legal consequences on Facebook.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/a/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=cbcnews, cbcnews://1.5412016", "og": {"site_name": "CBC", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/caf%C3%A9-bar-quebe-city-la-ninkasi-1.5412016", "title": "Art stolen from Quebec City caf\u00e9-bar returned, thanks to social media | CBC News", "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5412021.1577829613!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/missing-artwork.jpg", "description": "The art was turned over to police after the alleged thieves were served a thinly veiled threat of legal consequences on Facebook.", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 128015371297}, "vf": {"section": "2.652", "unique_id": "1.5412016"}, "google-site-verification": "pJy_QmRvDz2tr7X8eQ6Y1L3Se-8RWM_PpJX42Pr_fYo", "twitter": {"site": "@cbc", "player": {"width": 640, "height": 360}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The art was turned over to police after the alleged thieves were served a thinly veiled threat of legal consequences on Facebook."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/caf%C3%A9-bar-quebe-city-la-ninkasi-1.5412016"}
