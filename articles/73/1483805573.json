She was last seen leaving the bar with two heavy-set black men, Birmingham police say.\n\nShe appeared to have left the bar willingly with the two men, police say.\n\nBut a text she sent that night to a coworker indicated she thought she might be in peril, her mother, Charlaine Houston, said in a Facebook post.\n\n\u201cIf I call answer, I don\u2019t know these people and I feel in trouble,\u201d the text reads, according to her mother. Paighton had driven to the bar with the coworker earlier in the day, the mother wrote.\n\nHer bank account has had no recent activity, and calls to her cell phone go straight to voicemail, her family says.\n\nPaighton Houston lives in Trussville, roughly a 15-mile drive northeast of downtown Birmingham. She was last seen wearing ripped blue jeans, a coral-colored T-shirt and blue Converse shoes, police said.\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey has offered a $5,000 reward for credible information in the search for Houston. Crime Stoppers also is offering a $5,000 reward.\n\n\u201cIn the midst of the busy holiday season, it is critical that we support Paighton, her family and law enforcement to ensure we do everything possible to bring her home,\u201d Ivey said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["national & world news", ""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cnn Wire"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A woman who disappeared after leaving an Alabama bar had texted a coworker that she was with strangers and felt she was in trouble, her mother says.
