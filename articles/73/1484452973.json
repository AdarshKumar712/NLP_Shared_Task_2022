These data showed that 36 percent (29/80) of the relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia patients achieved durable complete response, defined as a CR with a hematological remission maintained for at least 180 days. The objective response rate (ORR) was at 75 percent. Eighty-one percent of patients with CR experienced eradication of minimal residual disease as reflected by MRD-negative status. In addition, there was a 61 percent probability that patients who achieved a CR would maintain it after five years.\n\nThe EMA filling acceptance follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Lumoxiti in September 2018.\n\n\n\nAbout Lumoxiti (moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk):\n\nLumoxiti is a CD22-directed immunotoxin and a first-in-class treatment in the US for adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) hairy cell leukemia (HCL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including treatment with a purine nucleoside analog. Lumoxiti is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl \u2264 29 mL/min). It comprises the CD22 binding portion of an antibody fused to a truncated pseudomonas exotoxin. The toxin inhibits protein synthesis and ultimately triggers apoptotic cell death. Lumoxiti received U.S. FDA approval in September 2018 and has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of r/r HCL. AstraZeneca is the current Biologics License Application (BLA) holder for Lumoxiti in the US, and is also the marketing authorization applicant for the EU filing.\n\nAbout the \u20181053\u2019 Phase III trial:\n\nThe approval of Lumoxiti was based on data from the AstraZeneca-sponsored, open-label \u20181053\u2019 trial, which was a single-arm, multi-center Phase III clinical trial assessing the efficacy, safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics of Lumoxiti monotherapy in patients with r/r HCL who have received at least two prior therapies, including one purine nucleoside analog. The trial enrolled 80 patients and was conducted across 34 sites in 14 countries. The primary endpoint was durable complete response (CR), defined as CR with hematologic remission (blood count normalization) for more than 180 days. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, relapse-free survival, progression-free survival, time to response, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenic potential.\n\nAbout Innate Pharma:\n\nInnate Pharma S.A. is a commercial stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.\n\nInnate Pharma\u2019s commercial-stage product, Lumoxiti, in-licensed from AstraZeneca in the US, EU and Switzerland, was approved by the FDA in September 2018.
