But she did say anyone booking the pod would also need to have purchased a standard seat before having the option of moving between the two.\n\n\"The concept is designed as a pod you go to during the flight,\" she said. \"You will still have your economy seat separately for the other portion of the flight.\"\n\nExpanding service\n\nSome airlines already offer sleeping pods to their first- and business-class passengers, but the move from Air New Zealand builds on the airline's attempt to bring stripped-down versions of such perks to its economy-class customers.\n\nIn 2018, the airline marketed something it called Economy Skycouch to customers \u2014 essentially, a way to turn a row of three seats into one unit someone could lie down across.\n\nWatch the video below to see how it works.\n\n\"We expect other airlines will want to explore licensing the Economy Skynest from us just as they have with the Economy Skycouch,\" Goodman said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cbc News"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The airline says it plans to launch the service on its\u00a0direct flight between New York City and New Zealand's capital, Auckland, that will begin operating in October 2020.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/a/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "CBC", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-new-zealand-1.5476643", "title": "Air New Zealand to test out bunk beds in economy class | CBC News", "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5476717.1582736902!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/plane-bed-new-zealand.JPG", "description": "The airline says it plans to launch the service on its\u00a0direct flight between New York City and New Zealand's capital, Auckland, that will begin operating in October 2020.", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 5823419603}, "vf": {"section": "2.637", "unique_id": "1.5476643"}, "google-site-verification": "pJy_QmRvDz2tr7X8eQ6Y1L3Se-8RWM_PpJX42Pr_fYo", "twitter": {"site": "@cbc", "player": {"width": 640, "height": 360}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The airline says it plans to launch the service on its\u00a0direct flight between New York City and New Zealand's capital, Auckland, that will begin operating in October 2020."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-new-zealand-1.5476643"}
