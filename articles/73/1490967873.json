Orban said Thursday that a decision will be taken after meetings in the coming days with EPP President Donald Tusk, the head of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, an influential EPP member.\n\nBut at this point, Orban is still trying to persuade the EPP, the biggest group in the European Parliament, to become \u201cless liberal\u201d and hew closer to policies the Hungarian leader has espoused, Orban said. Those include staunchly opposing immigration and prioritizing national sovereignty in decision-making.\n\n\u201cIf EPP is unable to change itself, we think in the future it will be obsolete and we need a new European initiative, which is Christian Democrat,\u201d Orban told reporters in Budapest.\n\nThe EPP has played a key role in protecting Orban over the past decade, as he has centralized power at home while drawing EU probes over the erosion of the rule of law. But the party\u2019s patience has worn thin, and it suspended Fidesz in March. Orban urged the group to embrace the continent\u2019s populist agenda, including anti-immigration.\n\nThe Hungarian leader said he was already talking with potential allies for his new EU party, including in Poland, whose ruling Law & Justice Party belongs to the European Conservatives and Reformists, the sixth largest group in the European Parliament. Orban didn\u2019t rule out that his Fidesz party may join the ECR if his bid to create his own falls through.\n\n(Updates with quote, details from second paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Zoltan Simon in Budapest at zsimon@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Scott Rose at rrose10@bloomberg.net, Michael Winfrey, Andrea Dudik\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Zoltan Simon"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  9 13:47:48 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he\u2019s ready to start a new political platform in Europe if his Fidesz party is forced out of the European People\u2019s Party, the continent\u2019s biggest such group.Orban has repeatedly threatened to preemptively withdraw from the center-right alliance", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooNews", "card": "summary", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he\u2019s ready to start a new political platform in Europe if his Fidesz party is forced out of the European People\u2019s Party, the continent\u2019s biggest such group.Orban has repeatedly threatened to preemptively withdraw from the center-right alliance", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png"}, "title": "Hungary\u2019s Orban Mulls New EU Movement if His Party Exits EPP"}, "application-name": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines", "news_keywords": "Viktor Orban, European Union, Donald Tusk, European Parliament, Bloomberg, Fidesz party", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=78e216c8-6b55-3841-a74b-0f26407c0e85&src=web", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he\u2019s ready to start a new political platform in Europe if his Fidesz party is forced out of the European People\u2019s Party, the continent\u2019s biggest such group.Orban has repeatedly threatened to preemptively withdraw from the center-right alliance", "og": {"type": "article", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he\u2019s ready to start a new political platform in Europe if his Fidesz party is forced out of the European People\u2019s Party, the continent\u2019s biggest such group.Orban has repeatedly threatened to preemptively withdraw from the center-right alliance", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "title": "Hungary\u2019s Orban Mulls New EU Movement if His Party Exits EPP", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/hungary-orban-mulls-eu-movement-134748968.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 338028696036, "app_id": 458584288257241}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=78e216c8-6b55-3841-a74b-0f26407c0e85&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=78e216c8-6b55-3841-a74b-0f26407c0e85&src=web"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://news.yahoo.com/hungary-orban-mulls-eu-movement-134748968.html"}
