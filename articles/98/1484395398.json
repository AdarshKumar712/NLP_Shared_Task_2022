The day also marks the birthday of actor Salman Khan. While many fans thought that it was a major coincidence, Aayush actually spilled the beans saying that bringing Ayat into the world on Salman's birthday was a conscious decision.\n\n\u201cThe due date was the last week of December or first week of January. When we told this to everyone, Bhai (Salman) was excited and said \u2018give me a gift\u2019. So, it was a conscious decision to bring Ayat into this world on that day. It is a very good omen to have her on Bhai\u2019s birthday.\" the actor told Hindustan Times.\n\n\"Also, it saves me from giving multiple parties! Arpita has a habit of throwing lavish parties, so I was anyway thinking how much I\u2019ve got to earn to celebrate hers, mine, Ahil\u2019s and Ayat\u2019s birthdays. \u201cNow, we all can go to the farmhouse, where on one side, we can celebrate Bhai\u2019s birthday and the other side can be booked for the kid\u2019s party,\u201d he added.\n\nAayush had taken to Instagram to share the first pictures with Ayat. \"Welcome to this beautiful world Ayat. You\u2019ve brought a lot of happiness into our lives. May you touch everyone\u2019s life with a lot of love and joy,\" he wrote.\n\nFollow @News18Movies for more\n\nGet the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.
