It returned on Nov. 5 and this time Popeye\u2019s insists that it won\u2019t run out again.\n\nChick-fil-A, which is now the third-largest fast-food chain in the country, fired back that its bun+chicken+ pickles is still the \u201coriginal\u201d chicken sandwich. Not to be outdone, Wendy\u2019s Tweeted that they were enjoying watching the two rival chains fighting over who has the \u201csecond best\u201d chicken sandwich.\n\nThe Dining Duo decided to take the chicken sandwich challenge to see which of the three we liked best. \u201cCat\u201d and I attempted to try this a few months ago, but Popeye\u2019s had not brought it back on the menu yet.\n\nI know I promised that \u201cCat\u201d would make an appearance, but Christmas family responsibilities got in the way and she was unable to take the challenge. She has promised though to join me for lunch and dinner in Germantown soon.\n\nInstead, I enlisted the help of \u201cPoison Ivy,\u201d who used her plant toxins and mind-controlling pheromones to get me to let her come along on this Dining Duo excursion.\n\nWe started with Chickfil- A. Believe it or not, \u201cIvy\u201d had never been to Chick-fil-A before. She\u2019s not much on eating fried foods. She enjoyed her first bite, noting that it had a nice pickle-y flavor.\n\nChick-fil-A\u2019s sandwiches are marinated in pickle brine, served on a toasted bun with two pickles. \u201cIt\u2019s very good,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cIt\u2019s very juicy. It\u2019s definitely not a chopped and pressed chicken patty and not very fast food-y. It\u2019s more like one that you would get at a sit down restaurant.\u201d\n\nI agree that Chick-fil-A has a good taste to it. I\u2019ve had it before. This time, thankfully, it wasn\u2019t too greasy. It\u2019s a good chicken sandwich, better than the frozen ones at McDonald\u2019s, but not my favorite.\n\nNext up was Wendy\u2019s country-style chicken sandwich. I expected this to be the weakest of the three. I expected it to be a small frozen patty. I was pleasantly surprised. It was a nice plump piece of chicken. It had a good taste to it, but it still tastes\u2026I don\u2019t know, fast food-y, but a higher quality fast food taste. I really liked it. \u201cIvy\u201d also agreed that it has a good taste, but noted \u201cit\u2019s not the quality of the Chick-fil-A.\n\nPopeye\u2019s was the one I was the most curious about. I love Popeye\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s my favorite place to go for fried chicken. But I wondered it if really could top Chick-fil-A. They are the \u201coriginal\u201d after all.\n\nOne thing we both noticed right away was how big the chicken is on these sandwiches. It looks like a big piece of breaded fried chicken. \u201cIt\u2019s massive,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cIt\u2019s good. I like it. It is more old-fashioned tasting.\u201d\n\nPopeye\u2019s sandwich is served on a toasted brioche bun and also has pickles. I\u2019m not a big pickle fan on my sandwiches, but the quality of Popeye\u2019s pickles are far superior to the ones on Chick-fil-A.\n\n\u201cThese are better pickles,\u201d Ivy agreed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIvy\u201d and I both agreed though, that Popeye\u2019s chicken sandwich doesn\u2019t taste like what you expect a chicken sandwich to taste like. It tastes, well, like fried chicken on a bun. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved it. But I guess I am used to a frozen chicken patty that you get at most fast food places.\n\nWe also sampled the spicy Popeye\u2019s chicken sandwich. I also love Popeye\u2019s spicy chicken, but it doesn\u2019t love me back so I have had to lay off it because it kills my stomach.\n\n\u201cIvy\u201d noted right away that yes, this sucker is VERY hot and spicy, the kind of burn your fingers spicy. \u201cJust licking my fingers made my mouth burn,\u201d \u201cIvy\u201d said.\n\nAt the end of our little taste test, \u201cIvy\u201d and I compared notes and assigned a rank to each one.\n\nIVY: 1. Chick-fil-A \u2014 \u201cI like that mild pickle taste,\u201d \u201cIvy\u201d said.\n\n2. Popeye\u2019s \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s very thick,\u201d \u201cIvy\u201d commented. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t taste like a chicken sandwich. It tastes like fried chicken.\u201d\n\n3. Wendy\u2019s \u2014 \u201cThis was my least favorite,\u201d \u201cIvy\u201d said. \u201cBut it is still good.\n\nIt looks more like frozen chicken though.\u201d\n\nBAT: 1. Wendy\u2019s \u2014 I know this is a shocker.\n\nBut it is really good. It was totally unexpected. I thought the quality was good and despite a fast food taste, it still tastes like country style chicken.\u201d\n\n2. Popeye\u2019s \u2014 Yes, it tastes like fried chicken, but the quality is top notch. I even ate my pickles.\n\n3. Chick-fil-A \u2014 I like Chick-fil-A okay. But honestly, it is greasy and it\u2019s just not my favorite. I love the waffle fries though.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Dining Duo takes the chicken sandwich challenge - The Evening Times", "url": "https://www.theeveningtimes.com/theeveningtimes/2020/01/02/dining-duo-takes-the-chicken-sandwich-challenge/", "site_name": "The Evening Times", "updated_time": "2020-01-02T18:12:59+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://marioneveningtimes-ar.newsmemory.com/newsmemvol2/arkansas/marioneveningtimes/20200102/et01022020_3.pdf.0/img/Image_7.jpg", "secure_url": "https://marioneveningtimes-ar.newsmemory.com/newsmemvol2/arkansas/marioneveningtimes/20200102/et01022020_3.pdf.0/img/Image_7.jpg"}}, "article": {"section": "Community", "published_time": "2020-01-02T00:00:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T18:12:59+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Dining Duo takes the chicken sandwich challenge - The Evening Times", "image": "https://www.theeveningtimes.com/theeveningtimes/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/92790724f1d4783b901fc0b05b70ad88.jpg"}, "generator": "MasterSlider 3.4.1 - Responsive Touch Image Slider | avt.li/msf"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theeveningtimes.com/theeveningtimes/2020/01/02/dining-duo-takes-the-chicken-sandwich-challenge/"}
