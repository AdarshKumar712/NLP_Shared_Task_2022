That\u2019s the only way you do it,\u201d she said, warning that eventually armed guards would be needed at all places of worship, not just for Jews.\n\n\u201cWhat starts with the Jews never ends with the Jews,\u201d she added, saying that anti-Semitism is a tool used to divide Americans.\n\n\u201cYeah, absolutely, like they are in Israel,\u201d she responded to a question on whether Jews should purchase firearms for self-defense.\n\n\u201cYou have to defend your community,\u201d she said, adding \u201cAnd non-Jews, too.\u201d\n\nThe most recent hate crimes against Jews \u2013 with a Hanukkah stabbing attack at a rabbi\u2019s home in Monsey and an earlier violent attack on a kosher market in New Jersey \u2013 have prompted some Jews in New York\u2019s Rockland County to begin open carrying rifles to protect themselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to wake up and protect yourself. Protect your people, your community, your family. You\u2019re under siege \u2014 it\u2019s not B.S.,\u201d Barr told the rabbi, urging him to get a gun. \u201cOf course! And get trained.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake sure that the people representing you agree with you that\u2026we have the right to protect ourselves,\u201d she said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Frieda Powers", "Michelle Malkin", "Dennis Prager", "Stephen Moore", "Tucker Carlson", "Neil Patel", "Terence Jeffrey", "Chuck Norris", "John R.
