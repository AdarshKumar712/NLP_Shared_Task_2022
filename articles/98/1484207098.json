This time it is Wendy Wanderman, an entertainment executive who specializes in film marketing and production. A taxpayer-funded initiative she proposed in 2009 has surfaced and is causing some heartburn for Buttigieg\u2019s campaign. Her proposal, \u201cCash for Fatties\u201d would pay people to lose weight.\n\nRemember Cash for Clunkers, the Obama administration\u2019s cash incentive program for drivers who traded in older automobiles to purchase newer fuel-efficient vehicles? This plan was along the same lines. She proposed that there be a program for the government to pay people to lose weight. She outlined her idea in a 279-word blog post published by HuffPost where she was a contributor at the time. The internet is forever and her old blog post is in the news.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ed Driscoll"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.pjmedia.com/instapundit/instapundit.ico", "meta_data": {}, "canonical_link": "https://pjmedia.com/instapundit/353317/"}
