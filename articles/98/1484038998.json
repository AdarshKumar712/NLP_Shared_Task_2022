I\u2019m here. I\u2019m free now,\u201d Berry, now 33, told the 911 operator.\n\nBerry, along with Gina DeJesus, now 29, and Michelle Knight, now 38, had been held captive for more than 9 years by Ariel Castro. Castro kidnapped each of the women between 2002 and 2004.\n\nABC News' Robin Roberts conducts the first broadcast interview with Cleveland kidnapping survivors, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus. Heidi Gutman/ABC\n\nFor years, the women endured unimaginable abuse, as they were chained, starved and tortured by Castro.\n\nThe three women never gave up hope, and since their escape they have worked to help and heal others.\n\nBerry and DeJesus shared new details of their years of horror and how they\u2019ve triumphed over their trauma in new interviews with \u201c20/20.\u201d\n\nWatch the full story on \"20/20\" Friday, Jan. 3, at 9 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\nApril 21, 2003: Amanda Berry is abducted\n\nJust a day before her 17th birthday, Amanda Berry got up and got ready for work.\n\n\u201cI almost called off of work that day because the next day was my birthday. You know, what if? What if I would\u2019ve called off that day?\u201d Berry said.\n\nWhile walking home from work, a vehicle started to follow Berry down the street, and the man inside asked her if she needed a ride home.\n\nThe man, Ariel Castro, was an elementary school bus driver and the father of Berry\u2019s friend and classmate from middle school.\n\nIn April 2003, Castro kidnapped 16-year-old Amanda Berry as she was walking home from her job at Burger King. ABC\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Well she\u2019s at my house. Would you like to go see her?\u2019\" Castro said of his daughter, who lived in another neighborhood with her mother, Castro's ex-wife.\n\n\"I said, \u2018Yeah, sure,\u2019\u201d Berry said.\n\nAfter they entered the white, two-story house on Seymour Avenue, Castro told Berry that his daughter might be taking a bath, she said.\n\n\u201cSo he said, \u2018We\u2019ll just wait,\u2019\u201d Berry said. \u201cSo he started showing me around the house. And I never got back out.\u201d\n\nCastro took Berry upstairs and showed her something strange: a mystery woman sleeping in a bedroom in front of a television set. She later learned that the woman was Michelle Knight, who was abducted by Castro at 21 and had been held by him for almost a year. Berry\u2019s memories of what happened next are still raw.\n\n\u201cHe took me to the next bedroom, and it was just really dark in there, and he didn\u2019t turn on the lights, and there was a little, like, a little room off of the bigger bedroom, kind of a big closet,\u201d Berry said. \u201cAnd he took me in there, and he told me to pull down my pants. And from there I knew, like, this was not going to be good.\u201d\n\nShe became Castro\u2019s second prisoner.\n\n\u201cHe took me to the basement and he taped my wrists and he taped my ankles and he put on a belt around my ankles over the tape,\u201d Berry said. \u201cHe put a helmet over my head, and he said, \u2018Just be quiet and don\u2019t make any noise. And I\u2019ll take you home.\u2019\u201d\n\nBerry said Castro chained her to a pole, shut off the lights and left her in the dark with a television on.\n\n\u201cI just started screaming and crying\u2026 \u2018Somebody please help me,\u2019 you know. And nobody, nobody came,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so scared that I was going to die. I didn\u2019t think that I was going to ever make it home.\u201d\n\nApril 24, 2003: Day 4 of Amanda Berry\u2019s Captivity\n\nAs news of her abduction made headlines, Berry watched her mother and sister on the TV in the basement.\n\n\u201cThat kept me going. And I said, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m going to make it home to you. As long as you fight, I\u2019m going to fight,\u2019\u201d Berry said.\n\nOn the fourth day of her abduction, April 24, 2003, Berry said Castro moved her to an upstairs bedroom and chained her to a radiator.\n\n\u201cIt was really hard, you know, because in the beginning, the chain was around my stomach,\u201d Berry said. \u201cGoing to sleep at night, you know, if you wanted to toss on to your back, you couldn\u2019t do that, you would have to take the whole chain and move it to the front of your stomach so that you're not laying on the big lock on your back.\u201d\n\nOne week after Amanda Berry\u2019s abduction, Castro calls her family\n\nBerry was missing for a week when her family received a late-night call from Castro, who taunted them using Berry\u2019s cell phone.\n\n\u201cHe called and said, \u2018I have Mandy,\u2019 which, nobody called her Mandy but [people] who knew her,\u201d said Beth Serrano, Berry\u2019s sister. \u201c'She wants to be with me.'\u201d\n\nIn 2003, the FBI was just starting to develop technology that could track a cell phone\u2019s location if it was turned on. With that information, they were able to narrow down that her phone had been used within a thirty to forty block area.\n\n\u201cWe spent about a week, around the clock, in that area, hoping that this phone would be used again,\u201d FBI agent Tim Kolonik said. But Castro never used Berry\u2019s phone again.\n\n\u201cThat was the last we heard of anything,\u201d Serrano said.\n\nMeanwhile, Berry\u2019s dark and filthy room at Castro\u2019s house was about the size of a closet.\n\n\u201cThe mattress was old and nasty, and it was just disgusting. And we had the bucket to use the bathroom, and that smelled horrible,\u201d Berry said.\n\nOnce a day, Berry said, Castro gave her a bag of chips or crackers or other food to eat. But everything, including her weekly shower, came at a price.\n\nIn April 2003, Castro kidnapped 16-year-old Amanda Berry as she was walking home from her job at Burger King. FBI\n\n\u201cI mean, he tried to act nice, but he\u2019s like, \u2018Well, maybe you need to go take a shower,\u2019 and I had to take a shower with him,\u201d Berry said.\n\nBerry said she had to \u201cnumb\u201d herself to cope with the sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cYou, like, put your mind somewhere else so that you're not there. You know, you're not in that room with him,\u201d Berry said.\n\nIn her diary, Berry used a code to record how many times he raped her each day.\n\n\u201cI would always write these numbers at the top of the pages, because I felt like, you know, one day maybe authorities will get to read it. And he\u2019ll be punished for what he did,\u201d Berry said.\n\n\u201cThere was plenty of times when I just never knew,\u201d Berry said, adding that she thought, \u201cWhy is he keeping me here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if one day we were gonna be murdered or he wanted more girls in the house,\u201d Berry said. \u201cLike, what was he going to do to us.\u201d\n\nAlmost a year after Berry became his prisoner, Castro went on the prowl again just five blocks away from the street where he kidnapped Berry.\n\nApril 2, 2004: Gina DeJesus is abducted\n\nGina DeJesus, then 14 years old, was close friends with Castro\u2019s daughter, Arlene. Castro was also friends with DeJesus\u2019 dad. On the day she was kidnapped, DeJesus and Arlene were heading home from school when they went their separate ways.\n\nAs DeJesus continued her journey home, a maroon vehicle pulled up on the curb with Arlene\u2019s father at the wheel.\n\n\u201cHe asks me\u2026 'You seen my daughter?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah, she\u2019s right around the corner,\u2019 and he was like, \u2018Can you help me find her?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Sure,\u2019\u201d DeJesus said.\n\nBut instead, Castro drove Gina to his house, where he asked her for help moving a stereo. Once inside, DeJesus was unnerved by his bizarre behavior, she said.\n\n\u201cHe was, like, fixing his eyebrows and, like, trimming his mustache and, like, cutting his nose hairs,\u201d DeJesus said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like, starts like, to, like, touch me and stuff, and then I\u2019m like, \u2018What are you doing? You could go to jail.\u2019 He just switches up like, \u2018Well, OK, we\u2019re going to, you\u2019re going to go home now.\u2019 He said, \u2018But you can\u2019t go through the same door you came in.\u2019\u201d\n\nA year after Berry's abduction, Castro abducted 14-year-old Gina DeJesus as she returned home from middle school. FBI\n\nCastro led DeJesus to his basement, where she said he grabbed her and chained her up.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t make it tight enough, so I threw it over, and then I tried to run, but he sat on my back,\u201d DeJesus said. \u201cAnd then I just start kicking him. I kicked him and I bruised him really bad.\u201d\n\nAs Castro overpowered her, DeJesus screamed for help, but the radio in his basement and the radio in the living room were too loud, DeJesus said.\n\n\u201cHe, would take my hair and like, put it in his mouth. \u2026 I don\u2019t know why he did it but it was gross,\u201d she said.\n\nDeJesus said the first time Castro raped her was on May 7, 2004. Though she remembers the exact date, DeJesus said she was not comfortable discussing the details of what happened.\n\nLife in captivity\n\nAt first, DeJesus was Castro\u2019s new favorite.\n\n\u201cHe seems to treat me better than the other girls. I have the nicer room,\u201d DeJesus said.\n\nA year after Berry's abduction, Castro abducted 14-year-old Gina DeJesus as she returned home from middle school. ABC\n\nBerry said the slight gestures of favoritism made the girls feel jealous: \u201cIt was just simple things, but when you don\u2019t have anything, you\u2019re like, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t I have that? I want that.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe said that at first, Castro took special care to keep the girls divided and did not permit them to talk.\n\n\u201cHe was always there watching every move, it was like he knew everything, every move that we did,\u201d DeJesus said.\n\nThe girls were occasionally allowed out of their rooms to do chores, but had to obey stringent rules.\n\n\u201cWe had to use, like, a tiny drop of, dish soap to wash like a full sink of dishes,\u201d Berry said.\n\n\u201cWe had to put the pan in the center on the stove,\u201d DeJesus added.\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a little to the left, a little to the right,\u201d Berry said.\n\nTo fill the empty hours, Berry kept a diary in notebooks, on napkins and even on fast food bags. The black-and-white television was their only window to the outside world.\n\nAmanda Berry tried to make her daughter Jocelyn's life normal in their room seen here. FBI\n\nMarch 2006: Amanda Berry\u2019s mom dies while she\u2019s in captivity\n\nBerry said she would watch the Montel Williams Show featuring psychic Sylvia Browne, desperately wishing her mother would appear on the program so \u201c[Browne] could tell my mom that I was alive and that I\u2019m OK,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2004, Berry\u2019s mother Louwana Miller, went on the show. Browne told her, \u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2026 she\u2019s not alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just broke down crying because I couldn\u2019t believe she said that,\u201d Berry said. \u201cAnd then my mom broke down crying, so that hurt even worse.\u201d\n\nTogether, Amanda Berry and her daughter Jocelyn shared the room in Ariel Castro's house pictured here. FBI\n\nMiller never got to see her daughter freed. She died of heart failure three years after Berry disappeared.\n\n\u201cI think that was the hardest part of being in there. Like, she was always fighting. And she was never gonna give up on me,\u201d Berry said. \u201cFor her to get sick and I couldn\u2019t be there with her ... I couldn\u2019t help her when she was sick.\u201d\n\nChristmas 2006: Amanda Berry Gives Birth\n\nBerry realized she might be pregnant on her 20th birthday.\n\n\u201cI was terrified. How? I mean, I barely eat,\u201d Berry said, \u201cand I\u2019m chained to a wall, and I have a bucket for a bathroom.\u201d\n\nShe gave birth to Jocelyn on Christmas in 2006.\n\n\u201cThis is his kid, you know. How do I feel about that? And she resembled him a lot, and I would look at her, and I just felt, like, she\u2019s mine. She\u2019s mine,\u201d Berry said.\n\nDeJesus said that having the little girl there with them was a welcome distraction.\n\n\u201cIt was fun because I can get away from the situation,\u201d DeJesus said. \u201cWhen I was playing with Jocelyn, Jocelyn made me forget everything.\u201d\n\nGina DeJesus and Michelle Knight shared this room in Ariel Castro's house. FBI\n\nJocelyn saw the chains on her mother, which Berry said Castro instructed her to call \u201cbracelets.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was about 2, almost 3 years old, and he finally took the chains off of me. And that was because of Jocelyn.\u201d\n\nAs Jocelyn grew older, Castro allowed her freedoms that Berry, DeJesus and Knight were not given.\n\nThough she was locked in with the three of them whenever Castro left the house, Jocelyn occasionally was allowed to go outside in the backyard, to the park or to Sunday services with her father. Castro\u2019s love for Jocelyn seemed to turn him into a different man with her.\n\n\u201cShe loved him, and he loved her,\u201d Berry said. \u201cI was nervous, like, would he touch her? Would he ever think about touching her because, you know, he had his problems?\u201d\n\nMay 6, 2013: Escape\n\nThe women finally made their escape after more than nine years in captivity.\n\n\u201cJocelyn goes downstairs, and then she runs back up, and she says, \u2018I don\u2019t find Daddy. Daddy\u2019s nowhere around,\u2019\u201d DeJesus said.\n\n\u201cMy heart immediately started pounding,\" Berry said. \"I\u2019m like, \u2018Should I chance it? If I\u2019m going to do it, I need to do it now.'\"\n\nFor the first time in 10 years, Berry said she found her bedroom door unlocked without Castro around. Downstairs, the front door was open but wired with an alarm. Beyond it, the storm door was padlocked shut, but Berry was still able to squeeze out an arm.\n\nDeJesus said she thought Berry had been caught by Castro and talked Knight out of running to Berry. Berry said someone passing by outside saw her, but did not intervene.\n\nThat\u2019s when neighbor Charles Ramsey showed up.\n\nA general view of the exterior of the house where, on Monday, three women who had disappeared as teenagers approximately ten years ago were found alive on May 7, 2013 in Cleveland, Ohio. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\n\u201cHe kind of, like, started like trying to pull on the door, but he couldn\u2019t get it open either,\u201d Berry said. \u201cAnd so he, like, kind of kicks it, and he\u2019s like, \u2018There you go. Finish kicking it out, and you can get out.\u2019\u201d\n\nOnce Berry was out, she called for Jocelyn to crawl through the door. The two of them found a neighbor with a phone to call 911. Police arrived and rescued DeJesus and Knight.\n\n\u201cI was terrified, and just because there\u2019s people on the street doesn\u2019t mean that he wouldn\u2019t hurt me. I was so terrified,\u201d Berry said. \u201cI still don\u2019t know why he left that day with the door unlocked. I will never know.\u201d\n\nDeJesus remembered it took her \u201ca while to come out\u201d of her room because she didn\u2019t believe the police were really there.\n\n\u201cI thought maybe they were people in costumes \u2018cause I was shocked,\u201d she said. She wasn\u2019t the only one.\n\n\u201cWhen I was telling [first responders] my name, they looked like they\u2019d seen a ghost or something,\u201d DeJesus said. \u201cLike their face completely dropped.\u201d\n\nWhere Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus are today\n\nOn Aug. 1, 2013, Castro was sentenced to life plus 1,000 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to 937 counts of kidnapping and rape. On Sept. 3, 2013, he was found dead in his prison cell. He had killed himself.\n\nBy then, Castro\u2019s house had already been demolished. It is now a garden.\n\nTwo years later, DeJesus and Berry graduated from high school. DeJesus got to have the quincea\u00f1era she never had and wore a dazzling white dress.\n\nBerry and DeJesus together wrote their memoir, \u201cHope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland,\u201d with Washington Post journalists Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan, which was released in April 2015.\n\nBerry now works with a local news station covering missing children and adults in the Cleveland area.\n\n\u201cThat's the most important thing that I'm doing right now,\u201d Berry said. \u201cI just want to make the world a better place.\u201d\n\nOhio Gov.

Tony Dejak/AP Photo\n\nBerry is also raising Jocelyn, who\u2019s now 13 and thriving.\n\n\u201cJocelyn is more special than I could even use words to describe. I always describe her as wise beyond her years,\u201d said Jocelyn\u2019s former teacher Erin Hennessey.\n\nIn 2018, DeJesus founded The Cleveland Family Center for Missing Children and Adults to \u201cwork with the families to help them navigate the media, to help to go to the police station,\u201d DeJesus said.\n\n\u201cWhen she disappeared, we really struggled as a family to get help for anything and Gina really feels no family should have to ever endure that kind of pain while they're looking for a family member,\u201d said Sylvia Colon, DeJesus\u2019 cousin and the center\u2019s co-founder.\n\nMost amazingly, DeJesus\u2019 foundation is located on the same street where she was held captive for nine long years.\n\n\u201cI just want to change the neighborhood. I want to turn it to, like, positive and I want to give back,\u201d she said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["null"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Allie Yang", "Alexa Valiente", "Joseph Diaz", "January", "Min Read"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus spoke openly about their decade being held captive by Ariel Castro.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus spoke openly about their decade being held captive by Ariel Castro.", "keywords": "null", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
