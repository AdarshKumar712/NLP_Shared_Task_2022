If there is no agreement by 13 January, the Northern Ireland Secretary has little option but to call a fresh Stormont election. But the British and Irish governments, who paused the talks shortly before Christmas, appear confident a deal can be done. This month marks three years since the collapse of the power-sharing administration and Northern Ireland has remained in governmental limbo ever since. Budget crises in the health and education services have increased the pressure on the DUP and Sinn Fein to reach a compromise. In her New Year message, DUP leader Arlene Foster MLA said the new decade \"must be about stable devolution where the Executive is committed to building a successful Northern Ireland at peace with itself\". \"The talks will recommence on Thursday. We will be there and stand ready to restore devolution through a fair and balanced deal,\" she added. \"A Northern Ireland that is going to keep moving forward must be one where everyone feels at home but also must be one where no one feels their culture is being marginalised.\" In her message to mark the new decade, Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald TD said: \"The choice is now for agreement or elections but the current situation cannot continue.  :: Listen to All Out Politics on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker \"It is in the interests of all our people that we establish good government and real power-sharing based on equality and respect. \"The outstanding issues can be resolved. The time for acrimony and division is over and the time for slogans and soundbites is over. \"The test now for every party that has talked up getting back to work is to go back to the Executive table and deliver.\"  Efforts to restore the power-sharing government at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement have remained deadlocked over the issue of an Irish Language Act. But disappointing general election results for both the DUP and Sinn Fein appear to have focused minds and raised hopes of a breakthrough at Stormont.
