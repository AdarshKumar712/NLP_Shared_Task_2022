"movies": [], "text": "I'm an Israeli lawyer, Jewish, married to a Palestinian resident of Ramallah. After years of wandering throughout the world, we returned to the West Bank with our two children, 5-year-old Forat and 2-year-old Adam. We are trying to lead ordinary lives in an extraordinary and unforgiving reality, one that I will share with you here. (click to read all previous posts). I have changed the names of people in the blog, including my own. \"Umm Forat\" means \"Mother of Forat\" in Arabic.\n\n***\n\nWe had been in the new house a week and a half, and I still hadn\u2019t managed to buy a bed for Forat, clothes hangers or a car. But on Friday morning I borrowed a friend\u2019s car and took the children for a day trip to Tel Aviv. Our first stop: the unveiling ceremony for my uncle, who died two months after we reached the United States. Exactly one year ago, I was busy organizing our new apartment in Philadelphia when my father called to tell me of the death his eldest brother, Shafiq.\n\nAgain I fought with Forat in an unsuccessful attempt to leave the house on time. Again I yelled and threatened her, that there wouldn\u2019t be time to play with her friend Noa, who lives in Holon and who was the third and last planned stop on our trip, after the unveiling and a visit to a Tel Aviv friend\u2019s storage space to collect a set of toy chests. Forat stood in the doorway of the apartment screaming, \u201cPinukki the Bear is angry at you! I\u2019m never going to do clean-up-tidy-up again!\u201d Great. She\u2019s learning from me how to make threats.\n\nOsama walked us to the car and buckled the children into their car seats while I arranged our provisions for the trip on the seat beside me \u2013 water, sandwiches, fruit and \u201chealthy chocolate\u201d balls. We drove west, toward the town of Beitunia and the villages of Ein Arik and Dir Ibzi\u2019, from which we would drive to Modi'in and then Tel Aviv.\n\nBy the time we reached Dir Ibzi\u2019, Adam and Forat had devoured eight healthy chocolate balls, six melted cheese sandwich quarters and a peach and a half. Adam fell asleep. The food revived Forat, who began peppering me with questions.\n\n\u201cIma, is there something that there isn\u2019t in Philadelphia but there is everywhere else in the world?\u201d I thought the question stemmed from the things she was re-discovering here, things she forgot during our stay in the U.S., like humus and falafel from the neighborhood restaurant, okra, sahleb and za\u2019atar with olive oil.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you have ideas of what it could be?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I want you to answer me.\u201d She said the last sentence half in English, half in Hebrew. As was the case the last time we returned to Palestine, the exodus from an English-speaking country encouraged her to turn Hebrew from a passive language (listening to me) to an active one: Ani rotza she-at to answer me.\n\n\u201cMaybe \u2013 longing for Philadelphia?\u201d\n\nWe turned down the steep, winding street that leads from Dir Ibzi\u2019 to the main road. It was a stunning view of sky, clouds, and green plants scattered on agricultural terraces among brown soil and white rocks. We approached the T junction at the bottom, where Palestinian drivers reach the main road, used by both settlers and Palestinians, stretching west toward the checkpoint between the Palestinian village of Naalin and the Israeli settlement of Modi'in Ilit.\n\nThe yellow iron gate was closed. Two soldiers stood before us, in front of a parked army jeep. I remembered the attack that had taken place the week before, at the spring near Dir Ibzi\u2019 and the Israeli settlement of Dolev. Seventeen year-old Rina Shnerb was murdered, and her father and brother injured. In the aftermath, settlement leaders called on the government to close the \u201csuperfluous\u201d entrances to the Palestinian towns, entrances \u201cthat have no reason to remain.\u201d I stopped the car.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said.\n\nThe older soldier, wearing glasses, answered me. \u201cIt\u2019s closed here. You can\u2019t pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I reach the main road?\u201d I asked.\n\nThe road leading to Danny Spring near the Israeli settlement of Dolev, where 17-year-old Rina Shnerb was murdered in August.

Close\n\n\u201cThrough a different entrance,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nI carefully made a U-turn on the narrow road.\n\n\u201cIma, why are we turning around?\u201d Forat asked.\n\n\u201cJust a minute, sweetheart,\u201d I said. A Palestinian car, driven by a middle-aged man was driving down the road toward us. I waved to him through the open window.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s closed,\u201d I told him and asked if he knew an alternative route to the main road.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cTel Aviv,\u201d I said, swallowing a rush of guilt, knowing he can\u2019t drive to Tel Aviv. I\u2019m not guilty, I reminded myself. I\u2019m responsible. He was driving to Naalin, the last village before the checkpoint, and agreed to let me follow him. I returned to my conversation with Forat.\n\n\u201cYou remember those people who stand at checkpoints?\u201d I asked Forat.\n\n\u201cThe ones who have trouble sharing?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYes. Well, they put up a checkpoint and are not letting us cross.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Ima,\u201d Forat said. \u201cWe\u2019re Jews.\u201d\n\nI felt a pang in my heart.\n\n\u201cYes, sweetheart, you\u2019re right. Usually they let Jews pass. But here they think everyone is Palestinian, and so they closed the road to everyone, including Israelis.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven to dolls?\u201d Forat asked.\n\n\u201cWhat, sweetheart?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven Israeli dolls?\u201d She stuttered over the word dolls, re-learning how to speak Hebrew.\n\n\u201cI think so. Because the road is closed to everyone, and the Israeli dolls can\u2019t cross by themselves.\u201d There was a brief silence.\n\n\u201cIs it morning now for Diana?\u201d Forat asked, referring to her best friend in Philadelphia, the daughter of an Israeli couple studying at the University of Pennsylvania and not planning on returning to Israel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night now for Diana-le,\u201d I said. I thought of what Osama would say about our conversation. Among the many thoughts racing through my head was the realization that this was the first time I heard Forat refer to herself as Jewish.\n\n\u201cForat, you remember that you and Adam are half Jewish and half Palestinian,\u201d I said. \u201cBecause Ima is Jewish and Baba is Palestinian. And you are half from me, and half from Baba, and you can decide what you want to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Diana also half Palestinian and half Israeli?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, both of Diana\u2019s parents are Israeli and so she is all Israeli and also Jewish.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut do they let someone who is half-Jewish and half-Palestinian cross?\u201d Forat asked.\n\n\u201cUsually yes. You and Adam and I can cross if there is an open checkpoint.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Baba too?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cUsually not.\u201d\n\nWe continued driving the 40-minute detour through narrow, winding streets, the local roads of the villages on the ridge above the main road. The traffic was light on a quiet Friday morning, the day of rest in the West Bank.\n\n\u201cIma,\u201d Forat said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell the soldiers?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat they should share,\u201d she answered.\n\n\u201cYou ask a lot of good questions, sweetheart,\u201d I said. \u201cI would really like to tell them. But I don\u2019t think they were ready to listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Forat answered. \u201cYou didn\u2019t try.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about I write down everything you\u2019re asking and telling me this morning, and I\u2019ll publish it so that the soldiers and also other people will read it? You\u2019re such a smart girl, maybe they\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d Forat said. \u201cIma, I want another healthy chocolate ball.\u201d\n\nWe reached the main street, and I recognized the entrance to the village of Naalin. I opened the window and waved, thanking the driver who led us there, who now entered Naalin, the last village before the checkpoint. A young female guard from the private security company stood in the inspection lane, wearing a flattering black t-shirt and fitted black pants. A young man stood next to her, wearing a bullet-proof vest and carrying a huge M-16 rifle. She waved me on without even saying \u201cgood morning\u201d to check my accent.\n\n\u201cWhy did they let us cross now?\u201d Forat asked.\n\n\u201cThis is a checkpoint mostly for Jews,\u201d I told her. \u201cIt\u2019s almost always open.\u201d\n\nWe reached the traffic circle in front of the settlement of Modi'in Ilit. According to Waze, we would be ten minutes late for the ceremony at the cemetery. I called my cousin Amram and told him not to wait for us.\n\n\u201cIma, is Uncle Shafiq still dead?\u201d Forat asked.\n\n***\n\nClick here to read Umm Forat's previous posts.
