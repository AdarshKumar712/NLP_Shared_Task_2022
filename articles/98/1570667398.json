Among others, the exhibition includes dozens of previously unseen erotic drawings by the artist, works that document the creation of the Silver Factory, and a room dedicated to the years following his attempted murder at the hands of Valerie Solanas.\n\n\u201cAndy Warhol is mostly known as a pop artist,\u201d says assistant curator Moran in the video. \u201cBut in this exhibition, we really wanted to return to the man and think about all of the desires, the fears that might have driven him to create art.\u201d\n\nWatch the curator\u2019s tour below.\n\nAndy Warhol will be on display at the Tate Modern until April 18, 2021.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["art", "fashion", "film", "music", "ideas", "ideas sharing network", "dazed & confused", "dazed", "dazed & confused magazine", "dazed and confused", "dazed and confused magazine", "dazed+confused", "dazeddigital"], "tags": ["Andy Warhol", "Tate Modern", "coronavirus"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Apr  6 16:23:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Curators Gregor Muir and Fiont\u00e1n Moran discuss Warhol through the lens of the immigrant story, his LGBTQ+ identity, and his concerns with death and religion", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"author": "Dazed", "keywords": "art,fashion,film,music,ideas,ideas sharing network,dazed & confused, dazed, dazed & confused magazine, dazed and confused, dazed and confused magazine,dazed+confused,dazeddigital", "description": "Curators Gregor Muir and Fiont\u00e1n Moran discuss Warhol through the lens of the immigrant story, his LGBTQ+ identity, and his concerns with death and religion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 249814310818, "pages": 23596074088}, "ahrefs-site-verification": "debf75f21fc4e16fb832e869976daffd1a5752328ffd454d8f64fb19173c449e", "og": {"site_name": "Dazed", "title": "You can now see Andy Warhol\u2019s Tate show from the comfort of your couch", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.dazeddigital.com/art-photography/article/48668/1/you-can-now-see-andy-warhols-tate-show-from-the-comfort-of-your-couch", "image": "https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/516/0-144-516-344/azure/dazed-prod/1280/8/1288966.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-04-06T16:23:00+00:00", "section": "Art & Photography"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Dazed", "url": "https://www.dazeddigital.com/art-photography/article/48668/1/you-can-now-see-andy-warhols-tate-show-from-the-comfort-of-your-couch", "title": "You can now see Andy Warhol\u2019s Tate show from the comfort of your couch", "image": "https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/516/0-144-516-344/azure/dazed-prod/1280/8/1288966.jpg", "description": "Curators Gregor Muir and Fiont\u00e1n Moran discuss Warhol through the lens of the immigrant story, his LGBTQ+ identity, and his concerns with death and religion"}, "theme-color": "#222222"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.dazeddigital.com/art-photography/article/48668/1/you-can-now-see-andy-warhols-tate-show-from-the-comfort-of-your-couch"}
