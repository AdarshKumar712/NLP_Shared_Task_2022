They need to return to the commitments they trampled on and admit to their mistakes regarding the Iranian nation,\u201d he said.\n\nRouhani noted that the US maximum pressure campaign on Iran was aimed at \u201csmashing the grandeur of the nation and forcing the country to surrender\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is impossible. The enemies should repent for their wrong acts,\u201d he stressed.\n\n\u201cYou are not a superior nation and government for the nation and the government of Iran. We respect your nation and strongly protest against your government. However, we state that there is a way back.\u201d\n\nRouhani further pointed out that Iran will continue its forward march despite US sanctions and pressure, thanks to the nation\u2019s \u201chighly vibrant morale\u201d.\n\nTensions have soared between Tehran and Washington since May last year, when President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions on Tehran as part of its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign aimed at forcing it to renegotiate a new deal.\n\nIran has rejected negotiating a new deal with the Trump administration, saying talks were only possible if Washington returned to the nuclear pact, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and lifted sanctions.\n\nIran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council \u2013 the US, France, Britain, Russia, and China \u2013 plus Germany (P5+1) signed the JCPOA on July 14, 2015 and started implementing it on January 16, 2016.\n\nUnder the deal, Iran undertook to put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of nuclear-related sanctions.\n\nSince May 2019, Iran has rowed back on its nuclear commitments four times in compliance with articles 26 and 36 of the JCPOA.\n\nIts latest step came in November when engineers began feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into mothballed enrichment centrifuges at the underground Fordo plant south of Tehran.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "http://www.iran-daily.com/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"generator": "Tarnama Portal 4.0"}, "canonical_link": ""}
