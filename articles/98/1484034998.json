But on Wednesday afternoon, they enjoyed a special group experience, going for an hour-long boat ride on Sydney Harbour before getting down to business at the inaugural ATP Cup.\n\nCaptain Tim Henman, Daniel Evans, Cameron Norrie, James Ward, Joe Salisbury and Jamie Murray all took their phones out as soon as they arrived at the harbour, taking in the great views before bonding on the boat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a great city and you know you\u2019ve got a lot of iconic features with the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House,\u201d Henman said. \u201cIt really is a beautiful city and it\u2019s great to be back.\u201d\n\nThe group posed for plenty of pictures as the boat passed under the Sydney Harbour Bridge, with some members of the team marvelling at people who were climbing the iconic landmark. They stepped around to the front of the boat to lounge and check out the rest of the Sydney skyline, including Sydney Opera House.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great change-up. It\u2019s nice to be here,\u201d Ward said. \u201cI love coming to Australia every year and obviously a new event and representing your country is always a special thing and hopefully we\u2019ll have a lot of fun this week.\u201d\n\nTeam Great Britain will begin its ATP Cup efforts on Friday evening at 530pm local time against Team Bulgaria. The other countries competing in Group C are Belgium and Moldova, with the winner automatically advancing to the Final Eight, also taking place in Sydney.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Team Great Britain spends plenty of time together throughout the year, from going to dinners to watching football matches.
