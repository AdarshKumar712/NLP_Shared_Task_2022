digital channels continues to grow, so does the need to protect consumers against the prevalence of online banking fraud.\n\nDue to the prevalence of banking scams, we urge consumers to be more vigilant and familiarise themselves with the different types of online banking fraud.\n\nThe following are the latest online banking scams consumers should be wary of:\n\nFlight purchase debit scams\n\nYou will receive an SMS informing you of a flight purchase debited to your account.\n\nFraudsters will ask you to select a link in the SMS to revise the transaction.\n\nWhen you select the link, you will be redirected to a fake bank website.\n\nYou are then redirected to an \u2018Update and Confirm Details\u2019 screen requesting more information to be verified.\n\nThe fraudsters will now be in a position to access your banking profile.\n\nSocial media scams\n\nBeware of fraudsters pretending to represent the bank you use on social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp or any other social media platform.\n\nThe bank will never ask for your credit or cheque card, account number, online banking login details or password or One Time Pin (OTP) on social media platforms.\n\nThe official accounts also display a blue tick indicating they are verified.\n\nChange of banking details scam\n\nYou will receive an email that allegedly comes from one of your suppliers asking you to update your banking details.\n\nBeware of this, even if it is on the supplier\u2019s letterhead.\n\nContact your supplier on the number you already have for them and not the one on the fraudulent letter.\n\nSpeak to someone you know at the supplier to confirm the change in banking details.\n\nCopy of payment notification scam\n\nYou will receive an email requesting you to open a copy of your payment notification.\n\nFraudsters will prompt you to login via the email attachment.\n\nWhen you open the attachment in the email, you will be redirected to a fake bank website.\n\nIn an attempt to steal your banking details you will be requested to login.\n\nAs soon as you enter your login details on the screen, you are redirected to a successfully logged out screen.\n\nThe fraudsters will now be in a position to access your banking profile.\n\n419 scams\n\nThis is communication by email to a recipient making an offer that would result in a large payoff for the recipient.\n\nThe details vary and large amounts of money are usually involved.\n\nThe victims\u2019 banking details as well as sums of money are said to be required in advance in order to facilitate the payment of the funds.\n\nEssentially, the promised money transfer never happens and the fraudsters may use the victims\u2019 banking details to withdraw money for themselves.\n\nPhishing\n\nCommunication seemingly from the bank or other companies that gets you to disclose personal information such as your ID number, address, account number, username, login details, password and PIN.\n\nThis information can also be used to gain unauthorised access to your banking account online.\n\nOTP email fraud\n\nUsing various methods of phishing, criminals also try to get access to your email accounts, commonly Gmail, Yahoo, etc.\n\nThey produce fake login sites that look like Gmail or Yahoo.\n\nOnce they have your email username and password, they have access to your emails (statements, personal communications) and this helps a criminal build a social profile of you.\n\nCriminals can also intercept OTPs that are sent to emails once they have access to your email account.\n\nOTP Sim swap fraud\n\nOnce criminals are in possession of your username and password, they can easily access your accounts on online banking.\n\nThey can also contact your service provider to do a Sim swap, which basically means they hijack your sim and have access to your SMS.\n\nThis also gives them access to your OTP.\n\nRemember, the bank will never ask for your username, password or Pin in an email, SMS, social media or phone call.\n\nNever select a link to our website that was sent via email. Always type in the bank\u2019s web address.\n\nREAD MORE: Post Office of parcel delivery scam\n\nDo you have more information about the story?
