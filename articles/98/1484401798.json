some readers may find disturbing.\n\nMark Holmgren was 17 years old when he borrowed his brother\u2019s motorbike. It was a decision that would alter his life forever.\n\n\u201cI was just driving too fast, turned the corner and I wiped out. I tore the nerves in my shoulder. It was a brachial plexus injury and from that day I could never use it. Couldn\u2019t move it, couldn\u2019t feel it.\u201d\n\nHolmgren, now 37, carried his dysfunctional arm around for nearly two decades before deciding it was time to do something about it this year.\n\n\u201cAt first it was: I\u2019m going to wait, they\u2019ll be able to fix it, they\u2019re coming up with new stuff, give me a robotic arm, stuff like that and I\u2019ve been waiting too long,\u201d he recalled.\n\n\u201cI just decided to remove it. Move on, I guess.\u201d\n\nHe contacted doctors at the University of Alberta hospital, who agreed to amputate his right arm in April.\n\nHowever, Holmgren didn\u2019t want to depart with his arm forever\u2014he wanted to have it preserved.\n\n\u201cFirst they sent me a paper, I signed it, sent it back to (the doctor). He brought it into the surgery room with me and just showed me all the doctors in there and they were all like,\u2018Yup, we know.\u2019\u201d\n\nAbout a month after the surgery, Holmgren got a call from the lab saying his arm was ready to be picked up.\n\n\u201cI carried it out of the hospital in a garbage bag,\u201d said Holmgren. \u201cI actually kept it in my freezer for about a month.\u201d\n\nHe admits that shopping around and asking taxidermy businesses to clean a human arm was a bit of a challenge.\n\n\u201cA couple of them told me no, like right away. There was no way that they were going to touch human body parts.\u201d\n\nBut after a few weeks of searching, Legends Taxidermy in Drayton Valley agreed to do the job.\n\n\u201cI went and dropped it off, and got it back just before Christmas.\u201d\n\nHolmgren even brought his skeletal arm to Christmas dinner with his family.\n\n\u201cSome of them wanted to touch it, some of them don\u2019t want to touch it. It\u2019s just mixed feelings when people see it.\u201d\n\nThe Edmontonian plans to show more friends and family his limb before retiring it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to keep it probably behind the sink in the kitchen. I\u2019m happy I did it. It\u2019s just not for everybody.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["edmonton news", "local", "breaking", "alberta", "weather", "red deer", "grande prairie", "fort mcmurray", "oilers", "eskimos", "st. albert", "sherwood park", "spruce grove", "strathcona county"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Laine Mitchell"], "publish_date": "Sun Dec 29 14:20:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Mark Holmgren was 17 years old when he borrowed his brother\u2019s motorbike.
