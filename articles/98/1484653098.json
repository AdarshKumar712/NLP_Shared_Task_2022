\"Unnao\", \"CAA\" and \"Jamia\".\n\n\"I hope the victim gets... like the Unnao verdict is today... and I hope we don\u2019t get disappointed more, and times improve and I hope we are kinder towards each other,\u201d Ohlyan said while alternately raising her palms to make the words visible.\n\nOhlyan also had a vertical line of the hakenkreuz (the Nazi symbol that resembled the swastika) and crosses drawn on her arms, to presumably express her opposition to fascistic regimes.\n\nI was not expecting that someone will talk about Unnao Rape case and CAA. She had written Jamia also on her hand. That someone is @GeetikaVidya pic.twitter.com/o0K8j4x0Lx \u2014 Harsh (@_ambedkarite) January 1, 2020\n\nIn response to host Rajeev Masand's question about what changed for the actors after they became celebrities, Ohlyan's answer stood out.\n\n\"One factual observation about current times is people do not listen to economists or historians. they listen to celebrities.\"\n\nShe then goes onto say that she continues to study as she understood how it would help her when she became a celebrity.\n\n\"I was asked why I was studying more. I said because I am gonna be a celebrity. And when I be a celebrity they should listen to me. The food that I receive is increasing, so I am making my table bigger rather than my walls higher,\" was her poignant reply.\n\nOnly two movies old, the actor's responses won the hearts of Twitteratis especially since many of her counterparts have remained mum over the issues of the Citizenship Act and the series of police brutality on protestors.\n\nGet the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.
