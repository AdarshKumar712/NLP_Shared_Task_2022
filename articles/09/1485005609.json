Disney dominated the 2019 box office while also debuting its own streaming service. The media juggernaut will continue to build on that success as it turns the page to a new year and decade. Disney+'s launch saw the availability of hundreds of movie and TV titles but there's plenty of fresh titles coming within the next twelve months.\n\nWhen Disney+ launched on November 12, the service used the big day to debut shows like The Mandalorian, Marvel's Hero Project, The Imagineering Story, The World According to Jeff Goldblum, Forky Asks A Question, as well as the feature films, Lady and the Tramp and Noelle. The service hasn't added too much in terms of additional programming but that will look to change as Disney+ continues to ramp up its exclusive titles in order to compete with the top tier of streamers.\n\nContinue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view.\n\nRelated: One Way Disney+ Shows Are Already Better Than Netflix\n\nWith dozens of projects still in development, Disney+ is scheduled to debut plenty of new films, TV shows, shorts, and documentaries this year.
