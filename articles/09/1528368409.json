Four officials acknowledged that the process has hit bumps, with high-pressure debates over resources and planning occasionally reopening fault lines between the White House and HHS that first emerged over Trump\u2019s broader health agenda,\u201d the report notes. \u201cMeanwhile, the White House remains worried about growing economic risks, with Chinese production plunging in recent weeks and U.S. companies like Apple and Walmart with significant investments in the country reporting they\u2019re taking financial hits. Senior officials fear that a sustained outbreak could slow global markets and upend a strong U.S. economy that has been central to Trump\u2019s political pitch.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s fumbled evacuation of about 400 Americans from the marooned cruise ship brought into focus multiple gaps in preparedness, said four individuals with knowledge of the episode,\u201d Politico added.\n\nYou can read more here.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Tom Boggioni", "Agence France-Presse", "Bob Brigham"], "publish_date": "Sat Feb 22 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fav-1.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/trump-afp-5.jpg", "url": "https://www.rawstory.com/2020/02/trump-panicked-that-bumbling-response-to-coronavirus-could-derail-his-re-election-campaign-report/", "title": "Trump panicked that bumbling US response to coronavirus could derail his re-election campaign: report", "description": "According to a report from Politico, the White House has become gravely concerned that the so-far bumbling response to the coronavirus could have a long term effect on Donald Trump\u2019s drive to remain in the White House beyond 2020.
