A separate trip for the Real ID will cost $12.50. The ID will feature a star on the card.\n\nFinally, Governor Andrew Cuomo and the State Legislature plan to continue their push to get rid of flavored e-cigarettes and related vaping products in the new year.\n\nLawmakers are looking to ban all flavors, with the exceptions being tobacco and menthol.\n\nNear the tail end of 2019, the state raised the minimum age to buy e-cigarettes and tobacco to 21 years old, hoping the move helps cut down the rising number of children using e-cigarettes.\n\nAs 2020 kicks off, expect many more bills, laws and acts to take place, some of which could have an affect on you and your family.\n\nStay with 12 News throughout the year for coverage regarding these legislative developments.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cal Dymowski"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://quincy-network.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2019/10/cropped-cropped-wbng-e1526654892462-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New year, new legislation across NYS - WBNG", "description": "2020 is now officially underway, and with it comes new legislation across New York State.", "url": "https://wbng.com/2020/01/01/new-year-new-legislation-across-nys/", "site_name": "WBNG", "updated_time": "2020-01-01T22:52:24+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://quincy-network.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2019/12/New-York-State-Graphic-3-860x485.png", "secure_url": "https://quincy-network.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2019/12/New-York-State-Graphic-3-860x485.png", "width": 860, "height": 485}}, "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T22:52:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T22:52:24+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "2020 is now officially underway, and with it comes new legislation across New York State.", "title": "New year, new legislation across NYS - WBNG", "image": "https://quincy-network.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2019/12/New-York-State-Graphic-3.png"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://quincy-network.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2019/10/cropped-cropped-wbng-e1526654892462-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://wbng.com/2020/01/01/new-year-new-legislation-across-nys/"}
