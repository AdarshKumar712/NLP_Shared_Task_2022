If you want to venture just a little farther, consider driving a few hours to a beach or forest. Even a small adventure can feel a world away.</p></div></div></section></div><div class="row list-item  list-item-text"><section class="5173410267136000 text"><h3 class="">The Most Sustainable Destinations</h3><div class="text-container"><div><p>According to <a href="http://sustainabletop100.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-SD-Top100-Press-Release.pdf"><u>a list compiled by a dozen sustainability organizations</u></a>, cities and towns in Slovenia, including Ljubljana, as well as locations in Spain and Palau — where visitors must <a href="https://palaupledge.com/"><u>pledge</u></a> to protect the natural and cultural heritage before entering — were among the best places to visit and leave a light footprint in 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of them was selected based on certain criteria: that they had a governing body to manage sustainability; showed commitment to protecting natural resources, people and heritage; and reduced energy consumption, among other factors. The aim of the list is to raise the bar on sustainability issues for all cities, said Claire Ellis, the chair of Ecotourism Australia, one of the organizations that helped determine the list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slovenia, Dr. Ellis added, was among the first countries to develop sustainability tools and certification programs at the <a href="https://www.slovenia.info/en/business/green-scheme-of-slovenian-tourism"><u>national level</u></a>. In 2016 its capital, Ljubljana, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/winning-cities/2016-ljubljana/"><u>was voted Europe’s greenest city</u></a> by the European Union, thanks to its public transport, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, and commitment to protecting green areas and saving waste water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Increasingly, Ljubljana and other sustainable cities are becoming aware of the “over tourism” occuring in cities such as Barcelona and Venice, Dr. Ellis and other experts said. In Venice, for example, locals have <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/venice-tourism-overcrowding-intl/index.html"><u>become increasingly concerned</u></a> about the cruise ships that cause environmental damage, dominate the skyline and often cause overcrowding of the city. Similar issues plague Barcelona, which is experiencing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/aug/30/why-tourism-is-killing-barcelona-overtourism-photo-essay"><u>soaring numbers of visitors</u></a>.</p></div></div></section></div><div class="row list-item  list-item-text"><section class="5096171135565824 text"><h3 class="">If You Want to Visit More Popular Tourist Destinations</h3><div class="text-container"><div><p>If you do choose to visit crowded and popular cities, consider doing so outside peak summer months, say experts. Stay longer, choose accredited accommodation (using a site such as bookdifferent.com, which ensures claims to sustainability are checked by third parties), and find local activities that give back to residents, instead of the most popular activities, which can also often be tourist traps. When you are a visitor to a new place, consider that you are voting with your “money and feet and wallet,” Dr. Ellis said.&nbsp;</p></div></div></section></div><div class="row list-item  list-item-text"><section class="5177667603136512 text"><h3 class="">Visit Places That Need Your Support</h3><div class="text-container"><div><p>Another way to spend your hard-earned dollars is to travel to destinations rebuilding after disaster. Puerto Rico, for example, has developed a robust tourism sector since weathering a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria.html"><u>devastating hurricane</u></a> in 2017. The island, which also faces sea level rise, was picked as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/travel/visit-puerto-rico.html"><u>The Times’ No. 1 destination</u></a> in 2019, because it represents many fragile places around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Travelers can help further by volunteering in environmental and social projects helping to rebuild devastated communities, said Laurie Myers, the project lead for the Global Travel and Tourism Resilience Council, which helps the industry to focus on sustainable outcomes for disaster-affected communities. “Travel and tourism is probably the fastest way to recovery,” Mr. Myers said.&nbsp;</p></div></div></section></div><div class="row list-item  list-item-text"><section class="5114917191417856 text"><h3 class="">If You’re Visiting a Coast</h3><div class="text-container"><div><p>And if you’re planning a trip to any coastal destination, choosing one with a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261517711002081"><u>Marine Protected Area</u></a> is another way to ensure the involvement of local communities in protecting landscapes and aquatic life. “Once the local population is engaged,” Mr. Myers said, it can help them to rebuild after crisis and welcome visitors to their natural environment in a way that is sustainable.&nbsp;</p></div></div></section></div><div class="row list-item  list-item-text"><section class="5141199572697088 text"><h3 class="">Once You’ve Chosen Your Destination:</h3><div class="text-container"><div><ul>
  <li><strong>Use an eco-friendly booking site for accommodation. </strong>Sites like <a href="https://www.bookdifferent.com/en/"><u>bookdifferent.com</u></a> calculate your carbon footprint per night based on your selection and include eco-friendly ratings. Choose accommodation that injects money back into the local economy.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Consider using a sustainable travel agent. </strong>Companies like <a href="https://www.lokaltravel.com/"><u>lokal</u></a> can take out some of the legwork by organizing trips and activities for you that take environmental and social impact into consideration.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Look for a system of verification.</strong> This will help you determine if a business is simply greenwashing, or has met standards set by sustainability councils.</li>
  <li><strong>Seek out local experiences. </strong>Homestays, local guides and programs that give back to communities are also good ways to ensure your money is injected back into the local economy.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that “not every destination has eco-certified accommodations which is why it is also up to travellers to pay close attention,” Lonneke de Kort, the chief executive of <a href="http://bookdifferent.com/"><u>bookdifferent.com</u></a><u>,</u> wrote by email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Many small scale accommodations can be green solutions as well,” they added. “For instance, think of a farm which uses solar power, serves fresh organic produce for breakfast and employs locals.”&nbsp;</p></div></div></section></div><div class="row list-item  list-item-cardgroup"><section class="5186657707884544 cardgroup carousel undefined cardgroup"><div class="wrapper"><section class="6320600410750976 card card-article article"><div class="paper"><div class="article"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/travel/tourism-pledges-sustainable-travel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><div class="card-container"><h4>‘I Vow to Tread Lightly’</h4></div></a></div></div></section><section class="6211415966744576 card card-article article"><div class="paper"><div class="article"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/travel/sustainable-travel-budget-affordable-tips.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><div class="card-container"><h4>Sustainable Travel Can Be Budget-Friendly</h4></div></a></div></div></section><section class="6222071042408448 card card-article article"><div class="paper"><div class="article"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/travel/climate-change-sustainability.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><div class="card-container"><h4>How to Be a Green Traveler</h4></div></a></div></div></section><section class="5187048281473024 card card-article article"><div class="paper"><div class="article"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/travel/ecotourism-scientists.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><div class="card-container"><h4>Looking to Scientists to Expand Eco-Tourism Efforts</h4></div></a></div></div></section></div></section></div></div></div><span style="font-size:0"></span></section><section class="5107863445831680 adposition undefined ad-inline"></section><section class="5090589691346944 subhead container"><span style="font-size:0"></span><div class="wrapper"><div class="grid-list-intro"><h2 class="guide-headline">Getting There and Around </h2><div class="leadin"><p>Transport is one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases and other harmful pollutants.

(According to one 2016 study, every metric ton of carbon dioxide or its equivalent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/reader-center/travel-climate-change.html"><u>shrinks the ice cover in the Arctic</u></a> by three square meters, or 32 square feet.)</p></div></div></section></div><div class="row list-item  list-item-text"><section class="6266267665170432 text"><h3 class="">If You Need to Fly</h3><div class="text-container"><div><p>Planes expend much of their fuel just reaching altitude and descending, so the shorter the distance you fly, the less efficient, said Bryan Comer, a senior researcher with the International Council on Clean Transportation.

According to one <a href="https://theicct.org/publications/transatlantic-airline-fuel-efficiency-ranking-2017"><u>2017 study</u></a>, even the most efficient cruise ships emit between three to four times more carbon dioxide per passenger per kilometer than commercial flights. Ships also usually burn the lowest-quality and most polluting kind of fuel, which can affect the passengers, crew, and the environment and populations of the destinations being visited, Dr. Comer said.</p>
<p>There are other reasons to avoid cruise ships — for example, when visiting sensitive destinations like Venice, where the boats can dominate the skyline, crowd the city and even cause large waves that some say have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49276730"><u>contributed to the erosion</u></a> of the islands. “There are aesthetic reasons to be concerned about traveling to places where your arrival makes such an obvious impact,” Dr. Comer added.&nbsp;</p></div></div></section></div><div class="row list-item  list-item-text"><section class="5186548655980544 text"><h3 class="">By Train</h3><div class="text-container"><div><p>By most accounts, trains as a form of travel emit the lowest levels of greenhouse gases and other harmful pollutants, whether they are electric or diesel-powered.

Not only will this make your life easier, but it also can help reduce your overall emissions footprint, as your luggage is likely to be lighter and easier to transport — whether you’re taking a plane, train, car or boat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alden Wicker, the founder of the sustainable fashion and travel blog <a href="https://ecocult.com/"><u>Ecocult</u></a>, recommends choosing a simple color palette; natural materials including cotton, linen and wool; and items that can be easily hand-washed and air-dried. Consider that clothes you travel with are likely to get dirty, worn and washed often, so choose clothing that is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/sustainable-clothing.html"><u>built to last</u></a>. (Here are some more tips for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/travel/the-right-way-to-pack-for-travel.html"><u>paring down your packing</u></a> before a trip.)</p></div></div></section></div><div class="row list-item  list-item-text"><section class="5066857446899712 text"><h3 class="">Reduce Your Plastic</h3><div class="text-container"><div><p>One of the easiest ways to reduce your plastic and consumption of single-use products is to pack a reusable water bottle when you travel. For a hot or cold climate, consider insulated bottles like the <a href="https://www.swellbottle.com/shop/swell/bottles/"><u>S’well</u></a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0719JFBKS?tag=digitren08-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;ascsubtag=1576468603909d1lf"><u>MiiR</u></a>, which can maintain a drink’s temperature for hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for destinations where the water may contain impurities, it may be worth spending a little more on a bottle that can filter and purify water, such as the <a href="https://www.lifestraw.com/products/lifestraw-go"><u>Lifestraw Go</u></a> or <a href="https://grayl.com/collections/grayl-water-purifiers"><u>GRAYL</u></a>. (These bottles can also help to reduce the likelihood of getting a stomach bug when abroad.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other reusable and environmentally friendly items can lessen the trace you leave behind:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cutlery and small containers. </strong>Taking along a small container for snacks can help reduce your plastic consumption, as can reusable cutlery. If you’re short on space, even taking one item, such as a <a href="https://packhacker.com/travel-gear/life-without-plastic/stainless-steel-folding-spork/"><u>foldable spork</u></a>, can help reduce your footprint.</li>
  <li><strong>Reusable straw. </strong>Plastic straws are known to harm wildlife and pollute the oceans, and in recent years have increasingly been replaced with alternatives, and in some cases, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/nyregion/new-york-today-plastic-straw-ban.html"><u>banned entirely</u></a>. But with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/travel/straw-bans-hotels-resorts.html"><u>travel industry lagging</u></a> behind on these changes, you may want to consider bringing your own stainless steel or <a href="https://finalstraw.com/"><u>collapsible</u></a> straw.</li>
  <li><strong>Toothbrush and toiletries. </strong>Choose a bamboo or biodegradable toothbrush, and bring soaps, shampoos and conditioners in refillable silicone bottles, like the <a href="https://www.humangear.com/gear/gotoob"><u>GoToob</u></a> from <a href="https://www.humangear.com/"><u>humangear</u></a>, a San Francisco-based company that makes a number of travel-friendly products.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Sanitary products. </strong>Consider using a reusable silicone <a href="https://www.webmd.com/women/guide/menstrual-cup"><u>sanitary cup</u></a> over disposable tampons, applicators and pads, which often contain plastic and other synthetic materials that can harm the environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Clothesline. </strong>Take <a href="https://www.anacondastores.com/camping-hiking/equipment/travel-accessories/go-travel-clothes-line/BP90000548"><u>a pegless clothesline</u></a> to hang up on your balcony or in the bathroom for small laundry loads and delicates.</li>
  <li><strong>Kindle or iPad over books. </strong>Bringing your books along in digital form can lighten your load and save paper at the same time.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Tote bag. </strong>Pack a cloth bag for extra souvenirs, a day out or shopping. Doing so is likely to minimize picking up plastic bags along the way.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Cloth napkins. </strong>Using cloth instead of paper napkins means less trash every time you eat. Take a few along and pop them in with the laundry when they get dirty.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Sunscreen. </strong>Many sunscreens contain oxybenzone, which is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/travel/most-sunscreens-can-harm-coral-reefs-what-should-travelers-do.html"><u>toxic to the symbiotic algae that live within corals</u></a>. Bring along a reef-safe option, such as <a href="https://www.rawelementsusa.com/"><u>Raw Elements</u></a>, instead.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Soaps. </strong>Consider bringing along an all-use biodegradable soap such as <a href="https://www.drbronner.com/"><u>Dr. Bronner’s</u></a>, which can be used to wash your body, hair, dishes and clothing.&nbsp;</li>

Ms. Wicker, the founder of Ecocult, recommends taking a cooking class when you arrive somewhere new. It’s “fun; sustainable” and, she adds, an opportunity to inquire about the nature of the agriculture and farming systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, <strong>eating vegetarian or vegan </strong>(whether at home or traveling) is a great way to make a sustainable and environmentally friendly choice. Meat and dairy, particularly from cows, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/30/dining/climate-change-food-eating-habits.html"><u>an outsize impact on climate change</u></a>, with livestock accounting for around 14.5 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases each year. If you still want to eat non-vegetarian, choose chicken or sustainably sourced seafood instead. If you want to try cutting these out entirely, however, tofu and nuts are among the most sustainable options.</p>
<p>When thinking about what to eat, you might also consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Packing snacks. </strong>Bring along containers and fill them with nuts, fruit or snacks from street stalls instead of buying prepackaged goods that can contribute to landfills.</li>
  <li><strong>Following the locals. </strong>Even if you don’t speak the language, you can often get a fantastic meal by simply watching what local people order: It’s more likely to be fresh and locally sourced.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Making sustainable choices. </strong>Avoid all-inclusive resorts that provide a Western-style all-you-can breakfast with a lot of waste and indulgence. Instead, seek out local dining experiences.</li>
  <li><strong>But sometimes, relaxing your rules. </strong>While you might eat a vegetarian or even vegan diet at home, consider bending the rules if it means supporting local farmers instead of big industry and having a better sense of where your food comes from.&nbsp;</li>
</ul></div></div></section></div></div></div><span style="font-size:0"></span></section><section class="5069569785856000 adposition undefined ad-inline"></section><section class="5149585764777984 subhead container"><span style="font-size:0"></span><div class="wrapper"><div class="grid-list-intro"><h2 class="guide-headline">Shopping</h2><div class="leadin"><p>What we bring home with us matters as much as how we travel there and what we leave behind.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="list-item " style="border-top:none"><div></div></div><div class="subhead-childnodes childnodes list-items"><div class="row list-item  list-item-text"><section class="5075815809155072 text"><div class="text-container"><div><p>Being conscious of your consumption while traveling is another way to lower your personal emissions and leave a lighter footprint. Here are some things to consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ask questions. </strong>Ask retailers about their environmental impact and the conditions for their workers.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Buy local. </strong>As much as possible, avoid chain stores and markets outside tourist destinations, which are likely to sell cheaply made, imported goods.</li>
  <li><strong>Buy vegan.</strong> Avoid items with animal products, especially when you are unsure of their origin.</li>
  <li><strong>Research eco-friendly boutiques. </strong>These stores will stock environmentally friendly goods that inject money back into local economies and support traditional craft. Museum shops are also likely to stock artisan goods, Ms. Wicker, the founder of Ecocult, says.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid Western-owned stores. </strong>Choose local options instead.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Discover the local fashion. </strong>Purchase goods made in the village, town or city you are staying in.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Look for a fair trade or similar logo.</strong> This indicates your clothes were made sustainably.</li>
  <li><strong>Take a reusable bag on your day trips.&nbsp;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Skip the packaging.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>For any gifts, </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/climate/nyt-climate-newsletter-shopping.html"><u><strong>ditch the wrapping paper</strong></u></a><strong>.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Invest in quality products that last.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And when it comes to clothing specifically:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Shop vintage</strong>. You’ll be saving money and the environment.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Also seek out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/sustainable-clothing.html"><u>those that are built to last</u></a>.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Ask yourself: </strong>How many times will I wear this? Don’t buy clothing that will either wear out quickly, or that you’ll barely wear.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Consider the fabric.</strong> Different materials have different environmental impacts, so that’s something to take into consideration. (Think wool over synthetics.)&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Ask even more questions of the storeowners. </strong>Ask about the conditions clothes were made in and where they come from.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>While it “can be hard to tell the difference between locally made traditional items and things that have been imported from China,” avoiding shopping malls and large markets outside tourist destinations is a good first step, Ms. Wicker said. With a little bit of research, she added, “you can usually find one or more boutiques that specialize in supporting traditional craft.”&nbsp;</p></div></div></section></div><div class="row list-item  list-item-cardgroup"><section class="5170360035049472 cardgroup carousel undefined cardgroup"><div class="wrapper"><section class="6317327964438528 card card-article article"><div class="paper"><div class="article"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/travel/hotels-sustainability-ecotourism.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><div class="card-container"><h4>Hotels and Resorts Ramp Up Sustainability Efforts</h4></div></a></div></div></section><section class="5182417753079808 card card-article article"><div class="paper"><div class="article"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/travel/colorado-overtourism.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><div class="card-container"><h4>Farther and Less Crowded: The Rise of ‘Undertourism’</h4></div></a></div></div></section><section class="5119731497435136 card card-article article"><div class="paper"><div class="article"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/travel/eco-tourism-greening-summer-vacations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><div class="card-container"><h4>Greening Your Summer Vacation</h4></div></a></div></div></section><section class="5205251560833024 card card-article article"><div class="paper"><div class="article"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/travel/electric-sustainable-travel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><div class="card-container"><h4>By Air, Land and Sea, Travel is Electrifying</h4></div></a></div></div></section></div></section></div></div></div><span style="font-size:0"></span></section><section class="5124976323592192 adposition undefined ad-inline"></section></div><div class="container author-details-container"><div class="wrapper"><div class="grid-list-intro"><h2 class="guide-headline">About the Author</h2></div><div class="row inline-section"><div class="author-detail"><div><p>Livia Albeck-Ripka is a reporting fellow with The New York Times's climate and environment desk.

For a hot or cold climate, consider insulated bottles like the <a href=\"https://www.swellbottle.com/shop/swell/bottles/\"><u>S’well</u></a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0719JFBKS?tag=digitren08-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;ascsubtag=1576468603909d1lf\"><u>MiiR</u></a>, which can maintain a drink’s temperature for hours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And for destinations where the water may contain impurities, it may be worth spending a little more on a bottle that can filter and purify water, such as the <a href=\"https://www.lifestraw.com/products/lifestraw-go\"><u>Lifestraw Go</u></a> or <a href=\"https://grayl.com/collections/grayl-water-purifiers\"><u>GRAYL</u></a>. (These bottles can also help to reduce the likelihood of getting a stomach bug when abroad.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other reusable and environmentally friendly items can lessen the trace you leave behind:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Cutlery and small containers. </strong>Taking along a small container for snacks can help reduce your plastic consumption, as can reusable cutlery. If you’re short on space, even taking one item, such as a <a href=\"https://packhacker.com/travel-gear/life-without-plastic/stainless-steel-folding-spork/\"><u>foldable spork</u></a>, can help reduce your footprint.</li>\n  <li><strong>Reusable straw. </strong>Plastic straws are known to harm wildlife and pollute the oceans, and in recent years have increasingly been replaced with alternatives, and in some cases, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/nyregion/new-york-today-plastic-straw-ban.html\"><u>banned entirely</u></a>. But with the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/travel/straw-bans-hotels-resorts.html\"><u>travel industry lagging</u></a> behind on these changes, you may want to consider bringing your own stainless steel or <a href=\"https://finalstraw.com/\"><u>collapsible</u></a> straw.</li>\n  <li><strong>Toothbrush and toiletries. </strong>Choose a bamboo or biodegradable toothbrush, and bring soaps, shampoos and conditioners in refillable silicone bottles, like the <a href=\"https://www.humangear.com/gear/gotoob\"><u>GoToob</u></a> from <a href=\"https://www.humangear.com/\"><u>humangear</u></a>, a San Francisco-based company that makes a number of travel-friendly products.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li><strong>Sanitary products. </strong>Consider using a reusable silicone <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/women/guide/menstrual-cup\"><u>sanitary cup</u></a> over disposable tampons, applicators and pads, which often contain plastic and other synthetic materials that can harm the environment.</li>\n  <li><strong>Clothesline. </strong>Take <a href=\"https://www.anacondastores.com/camping-hiking/equipment/travel-accessories/go-travel-clothes-line/BP90000548\"><u>a pegless clothesline</u></a> to hang up on your balcony or in the bathroom for small laundry loads and delicates.</li>\n  <li><strong>Kindle or iPad over books. </strong>Bringing your books along in digital form can lighten your load and save paper at the same time.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li><strong>Tote bag. </strong>Pack a cloth bag for extra souvenirs, a day out or shopping. Doing so is likely to minimize picking up plastic bags along the way.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li><strong>Cloth napkins. </strong>Using cloth instead of paper napkins means less trash every time you eat. Take a few along and pop them in with the laundry when they get dirty.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li><strong>Sunscreen. </strong>Many sunscreens contain oxybenzone, which is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/travel/most-sunscreens-can-harm-coral-reefs-what-should-travelers-do.html\"><u>toxic to the symbiotic algae that live within corals</u></a>. Bring along a reef-safe option, such as <a href=\"https://www.rawelementsusa.com/\"><u>Raw Elements</u></a>, instead.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li><strong>Soaps. </strong>Consider bringing along an all-use biodegradable soap such as <a href=\"https://www.drbronner.com/\"><u>Dr. Bronner’s</u></a>, which can be used to wash your body, hair, dishes and clothing.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>"},"name":"Reduce Your Plastic"},"childIds":[],"firstPublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","uri":"","createdAt":"2019-12-19T19:18:41.96827Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-27T15:21:28.274841Z","title":"Reduce Your Plastic"},"5069569785856000":{"id":5069569785856000,"name":"","category":"node","type":"adposition","slug":null,"desk":null,"data":{"name":"Ad Position"},"childIds":[],"firstPublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","uri":"","createdAt":"2019-12-19T19:18:42.862014Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-19T19:18:42.862014Z","title":""},"5075815809155072":{"id":5075815809155072,"name":"Text #1","category":"node","type":"text","slug":null,"desk":null,"data":{"body":{"raw":{"blocks":[{"key":"5jimt","text":"Being conscious of your consumption while traveling is another way to lower your personal emissions and leave a lighter footprint.
