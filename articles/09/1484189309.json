S. Senate after the House passage of two articles of impeachment Dec. 18th.\n\nThe Constitution requires a vote of two-thirds of the Senate to convict and remove a president \u2014 or 67 votes. However damning and culpable Trump\u2019s actions in withholding critical aid to Ukraine against Russian aggression to force an investigation of a political rival, very few believe that 20 Republican senators will join 45 Democrats and two independents likely to vote for conviction.\n\nBut the larger, and perhaps more important question is whether the trial is going to be conducted fairly, with full respect for the Constitution and the rule of law.\n\nMitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, has already placed a heavy hand on the scales against a fair trial. He said he will work closely with the White House to oversee the trial, though his control over the trial is limited. The Constitution places the chief justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, as the presiding officer \u2014 not McConnell.\n\nBut McConnell\u2019s strong bias in favor of what amounts to an indicted defendant, President Trump, is equal to having the head of a jury say he will side with the defendant before a trial even begins.\n\nThe ranking Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, wrote to McConnell, urging him to guarantee a fair trial in the interests of all parties and the country. That would mean, Schumer wrote, the appearance of key White House officials who have refused to testify and the release of vital documents withheld by the president.\n\nThere are several Republican senators who do not like or respect Trump \u2014 and are not afraid to say so. They range from outspoken critics like Mitt Romney (Utah) to occasionally independent skeptics such as Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Susan Collins (Maine) and Pat Toomey (Pennsylvania).\n\nWhile many more quietly express disdain for Trump, his policies and behavior, it totals far less than 20, barring a bombshell soon.\n\nSign up for The Point Go inside New York politics.

A 51-49 vote to require those witnesses and documents, including a full, unredacted version of the Ukraine call, would bring those to account.\n\nTrump\u2019s refusal to allow key White House officials to testify and to release vital documents is tantamount to Richard Nixon\u2019s cover-up in 1974 \u2014 the key act that led to his approaching impeachment and resignation. Even Mr. Nixon did not block White House officials from testifying.\n\nThe American public has a right to hear from White House officials who refused to testify before the House of Representatives as they developed two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. They are, especially, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton, a former national security adviser who was fired by Trump. Bolton once objected to the Ukraine meddling by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani as \u201ca drug deal.\u201d\n\nThe near-total acceptance of Trump\u2019s behavior by virtually all Republicans to this point is shameful. In addition to turning a blind eye to Russian aggression in Ukraine, basically supporting Vladimir Putin, the Republican Party has ignored an unprecedented pattern of corruption and unlawful behavior by Trump and his close aides.\n\nTrump fired or castigated anyone who dared to oppose him, from Assistant Attorney General Sally Yates, who warned about the Russian connections of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn, to James Comey to Michael Cohen. Cohen paid $130,000 in hush money to a porn star to help Trump. Flynn pled guilty; Cohen is in jail.\n\nPaul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, is serving a seven-year jail term for corrupt activities. The favoritism shown Trump\u2019s children by China, Arab countries and others is far worse than GOP claims against the Bidens.\n\nOnce Democratic House managers of impeachment lay out their case, the only defense for Trumpite Republicans is to try to slam the door on revelation of the broader context of a truly \u201cdeep state\u201d of malfeasance and corruption embodied by the 45th president. Even the vice presidential option to break a 50-50 tie on demands for critical witnesses and documents would fail if four Republican senators stood up for justice and the rule of law.\n\nFrederic B.
