It\u2019s Monday, Dec. 30. Julia Wick is taking a New Year\u2019s break, so today\u2019s edition is brought to you by L.A. Times Deputy Managing Editor Shelby Grad.\n\nIt was the worst maritime disaster in modern California history: On Labor Day, 24 people died in a fire on board the Conception during a weekend diving trip around the Channel Islands. Since then, two questions have been asked over and over: How could this have happened? And how can this be prevented in the future?\n\nNewsletter Get our Essential California newsletter Subscribe\n\nTimes reporters Mark Puente, Richard Winton and Leila Miller have spent months trying to answer these questions in a series of investigative stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong their findings:\n\n\u2014 U.S. Coast Guard records over 20 years show the agency repeatedly rejected some recommendations by the National Transportation Safety Board for tougher rules, describing the proposals as \u201cunnecessarily burdensome and a duplication of existing requirements.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The Conception was one of about 325 small passenger vessels built before 1996 and given special exemptions from safety standards that the Coast Guard imposed on new vessels, some of which required larger escape hatches and illuminated exit signs.\n\n\u2014 More than 100 boats in California were grandfathered with weaker safety rules, according to a searchable Times database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reporters\u2019 latest story asks whether the federal rules in place worked. Coast Guard safety rules require at least one crew member roving the vessel whenever passengers are in the bunk area. But even before the Labor Day fire that killed 34 people aboard the Conception, some former captains said this critical rule designed to protect passengers was not followed. \u201cIt\u2019s a regulation, but it wasn\u2019t really followed,\u201d one said.\n\n[Read the story: \u201cBefore Conception boat fire, some captains say Coast Guard safety rule was ignored\u201d in the Los Angeles Times]\n\nWhere is this all going?\n\nIn the aftermath of The Times\u2019 reporting, there has been a push to tighten safety regulations. The Coast Guard also said it is now reviewing whether some of the NTSB\u2019s earlier recommendations should be reconsidered. Expect action in Congress in 2020.\n\nAnd finally, here are biographies of the victims.
