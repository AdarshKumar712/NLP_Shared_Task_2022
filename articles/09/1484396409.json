Now we find the Administration is starting the process of getting the legal work done to end States from issuing drivers licenses to illegal aliens. Federal law is clear, it is a felony to assist illegal aliens in any way. Plus, the State\u2019s refuse to give data on who they issued the licenses to, If I were an illegal alien with a \u201clegal\u201d drivers license I would be scared\u2014tear it up, move and leave no forwarding address. At some point the Feds will get the information\u2014and by applying for an illegal alien drivers license, admits they are here illegally. \u201cChad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ordered a review of state laws that allow illegal aliens to obtain driver\u2019s licenses and restrict data sharing with federal immigration authorities. Wolf on Tuesday ordered all of the components of DHS to conduct a department-wide review of the state laws to determine how they affect their day-to-day operations, according to a memo obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The DHS chief\u2019s directive indicates he is prepared to take aim against the state laws.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, I am instructing each operational component to conduct an assessment of the impact of these laws, so that the Department is prepared to deal with and counter these impacts as we protect the homeland,\u201d Wolf\u2019s memo read.\n\nThe memo follows implementation of New York\u2019s \u201cGreen Light\u201d law, and passage of a similar bill in New Jersey in December. Both laws not only allow illegal aliens to obtain driver\u2019s licenses, but also restrict DMV data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nPeople are helped with their driver licenses as other people wait their turn, at the Driver License Division for the state of Utah on July 9, 2019 in Orem, Utah. (Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)\n\nIn New York, in particular, numerous county clerks have expressed reservation over the fact that illegal aliens can obtain a driver\u2019s license with foreign documentation \u2014 arguing that such a policy paves the way for voter fraud, identity theft, and even terrorism. DHS had already voiced its opposition to a provision in the New York law that prohibits Homeland security Investigations, a division of ICE, from accessing DMV information \u2014 even if the agency is investigating serious crimes.\n\n\u201cLaws like New York\u2019s greenlight law have dangerous consequences that have far reaches beyond the DMV,\u201d DHS spokeswomen Heather Swift said Tuesday. \u201cThese types of laws make it easier for terrorists and criminals to obtain fraudulent documents and also prevent DHS investigators from accessing important records that help take down child pornography and human trafficking rings and combat everything from terrorism to drug smuggling.\u201d\n\nA total of 14 states allow illegal aliens to obtain driver\u2019s licenses in the U.S.\n\nWolf\u2019s memo ordered DHS agencies to assess the following: What DMV information is currently available and how is it accessed? How is the DMV information used in day-to-day operations? What are the security consequences and long-term impacts if information is limited?\n\nThe memo also directs agencies to seek solutions for any security consequences that arise from the state laws.\n\n\u201cNever before in our history have we seen politicians make such rash and dangerous decisions to end all communication and cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security law enforcement,\u201d Swift continued. \u201cThe Secretary is prepared to take every measure necessary to ensure the safety and security of the homeland and we look forward to the recommendations of our agents and officers in the field.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 20:32:04 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://3b9m3d3keq0q4enwal2laffp.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/church/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Homeland Security Chief Orders Review Of State Laws Allowing Driver\u2019s Licenses For Illegal Aliens - California Political Review", "description": "In October the Trump Administration started enforcing the law in re: deportation for illegal aliens given the romantic name by Obama, \u201cDREAMERS\u201d.\u00a0 Now we find the Administration is starting the process of getting the legal work done to end States from issuing drivers licenses to illegal aliens.\u00a0 Federal law is clear, it is a felony \u2026", "url": "http://www.capoliticalreview.com/capoliticalnewsandviews/homeland-security-chief-orders-review-of-state-laws-allowing-drivers-licenses-for-illegal-aliens/", "site_name": "California Political Review", "updated_time": "2020-01-01T15:34:35-08:00", "image": "http://www.capoliticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DMV.jpg"}, "article": {"section": "Stephen Frank's California Political News And Views", "published_time": "2020-01-01T20:32:04-08:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T15:34:35-08:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "In October the Trump Administration started enforcing the law in re: deportation for illegal aliens given the romantic name by Obama, \u201cDREAMERS\u201d.\u00a0 Now we find the Administration is starting the process of getting the legal work done to end States from issuing drivers licenses to illegal aliens.\u00a0 Federal law is clear, it is a felony [\u2026]", "title": "Homeland Security Chief Orders Review Of State Laws Allowing Driver\u2019s Licenses For Illegal Aliens - California Political Review", "domain": "California Political Review", "image": {"src": "http://www.capoliticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DMV.jpg"}}, "google-site-verification": "9Qn3d7sTiJxgCNAnf6-cqrNWSQzGSfHWyMx6oVYPrS8"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.capoliticalreview.com/capoliticalnewsandviews/homeland-security-chief-orders-review-of-state-laws-allowing-drivers-licenses-for-illegal-aliens/"}
