Since that time, there has been an outpouring of grief from his fans, with this petition being the latest attempt to honor the 18-time all-star player.\n\nThe petition was started by a man named Nick M. who wrote: \u201cWith the untimely and unexpected passing of the great Kobe Bryant please sign this petition in an attempt to immortalize him forever as the new NBA Logo.\u201d\n\nAs of this writing, the petition has more than 2.3 million signatures.\n\nAccording to a statement given to CNN, it\u2019s the fastest-growing petition on Change.org.\n\n\u201cNick\u2019s petition is not only the fastest-growing on Change.org, it\u2019s also the first petition of 2020 to top 1 million signatures anywhere in the globe,\u201d said Michael Jones, managing director of Change.org. \u201cAs the world comes to terms with the death of someone as famous and well-known as Kobe Bryant, Nick has given basketball fans an outlet to create a permanent memory of someone who made history in the NBA.\u201d\n\nThe hashtag #ChangeTheLogo also began trending on Twitter, with fans and celebrities alike supporting the change.\n\nFans have also been suggesting possible images of Kobe that could be used as the new logo.\n\nNa this is one right here...@NBA gotta do this straight up pic.twitter.com/zRecMhzM7T \u2014 LaFaybeion Brown (@Mr_Brown26) January 28, 2020\n\nThe NBA\u2019s current logo was designed in 1969 by Alan Siegel and features the silhouette of Jerry West. Like Bryant, West was also a shooting guard who played his entire career for the Los Angeles Lakers (1960-1974). He later became the team\u2019s coach and is now an executive board member for the NBA.\n\nWest has publicly stated that, although he was flattered by the logo designed, he is also somewhat embarrassed by it. In 2017, he told the Washington Post that he wished the NBA would change it. \u201cIf they would want to change it, I wish they would,\u201d he said during the interview. West joked that commissioner Adam Silver would be a good replacement. Previously, in a 2015 Huffington Post article, West suggested that Michael Jordan would be a good choice for a new logo.\n\nSo it\u2019s a fair bet that the man who is the current NBA logo wouldn\u2019t object to the change, especially since he was the Lakers general manager when Bryant joined the team.\n\n\u201cI will love Kobe forever and always cherish the time that I spent with him,\u201d West said in a statement given to the Los Angeles Times following the crash \u201cI watched him grow from an energetic kid into the man he became, making a difference in so many people\u2019s lives. He has left the world a better place. Kobe\u2019s legacy will live forever.\n\nREAD MORE:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Gadgets", "Channel guides", "Social Justice", "Snoop Dogg", "Live TV", "Smart Home", "Race", "Petition", "Nba", "Internet Freedom", "Celebrities", "Justin Bieber", "Instagram", "TikTok", "Anime", "NBA", "View All.", "Reddit", "Kobe Bryant"], "authors": ["Vishal Iyer", "David Britton Is A Writer", "Comedian Based In Rhinebeck", "New York Who Focuses On Internet Culture", "Memes", "Viral News Stories.
