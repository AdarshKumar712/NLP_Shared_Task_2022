However it's a political case so an extradition can't go ahead\", Shipton said.\n\nAssange was forced out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in the United Kingdom last April, where he spent seven years evading possible extradition to the US over a major leak of classified cables that exposed alleged US transgressions during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nIn the same month, the whistleblower was subsequently charged with violating the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. A month later, the US Justice Department filed 17 additional charges against the WikiLeaks founder, mainly regarding violations of the Espionage Act.\n\nThe whistleblower is currently being held at a high-security prison in London pending an extradition trial that is scheduled to begin the next Monday.\n\nIn the United States, Assange could face 175 years in prison, with experts expressing concerns that his current condition would prevent Assange from properly participating in his defence. Several medical experts have said Assange has been tortured and continually denied appropriate healthcare while under arrest.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Assange's eztradition to US", "Assange's father", "Assange in jail"], "tags": ["trial", "Ecuadorian Embassy", "Julian Assange", "arrest", "London", "WikiLeaks", "United States", "prison"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "LONDON (Sputnik) - John Shipton, the father of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, said he was sure that his son would die in jail if he is extradited to the United States.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn3.img.sputniknews.com/i/sputnik.png", "meta_data": {"description": "LONDON (Sputnik) - John Shipton, the father of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, said he was sure that his son would die in jail if he is extradited to the United States.", "keywords": "Assange's eztradition to US, Assange's father, Assange in jail", "news_keywords": "Assange's eztradition to US, Assange's father, Assange in jail", "robots": "all", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "ahrefs-site-verification": "ahrefs-site-verification_899ad24abeb428773ae480d902877f72151b81b12d4b7293cbfa1c452c76adcd", "analytics": {"site_domain": "sputniknews.com", "article_id": 1078347738, "p_ts": 1582084859, "rubric": "world", "tags": "Assange's eztradition to US, Assange's father, Assange in jail"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SputnikInt", "url": "https://sputniknews.com/world/202002191078347738-assanges-father-says-wikileaks-founder-to-die-in-jail-if-extradited-to-us/", "title": "Assange's Father Says WikiLeaks Founder to Die in Jail If Extradited to US", "description": "LONDON (Sputnik) - John Shipton, the father of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, said he was sure that his son would die in jail if he is extradited to the United States.", "image": "https://sputniknews.com/sharing_snippet/1078347738.png?1582084859"}, "fb": {"app_id": 799135720145118, "pages": 357990416180}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=969452947, app-argument=com.sputniknews://article?issuer_id=17&issuer_article_id=1078347738", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.sputniknews.sputnik", "og": {"title": "Assange's Father Says WikiLeaks Founder to Die in Jail If Extradited to US", "url": "https://sputniknews.com/world/202002191078347738-assanges-father-says-wikileaks-founder-to-die-in-jail-if-extradited-to-us/", "type": "website", "description": "LONDON (Sputnik) - John Shipton, the father of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, said he was sure that his son would die in jail if he is extradited to the United States.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn5.img.sputniknews.com/images/107686/01/1076860161.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 440}}, "lastmod": "2020-02-19T04:24:49Z", "pubdate": "2020-02-19T04:00:59Z", "url_type": "usual"}, "canonical_link": "https://sputniknews.com/world/202002191078347738-assanges-father-says-wikileaks-founder-to-die-in-jail-if-extradited-to-us/"}
