The newborn weighed in at 7lbs 3oz and for mum Alana Brown, the special moment is still sinking in.\n\nThe mum said: \"I didn't realise that it was the New Year at first, then the midwives came in with glasses of champagne and raspberries saying she was the first.\"\n\nJust 25 minutes later, Lincoln Cohen was born. He was one of the tiniest babies of the day, weighing 5lbs 1oz, arriving a week early.\n\nMum Megan was joined by grandma Fiona Moulton, who was thrilled to meet her first grandson after greeting five granddaughters over the years.\n\nMs Moulton said: \"I've been waiting for him a long time. It's an emotional day.\"\n\nTwo of Bolton hospital's midwives were themselves among the parents welcoming babies into the world in time for the new decade.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, midwife Katie Burton gave birth to a girl named Penelope. Weighing in at 7lb 1oz, Ms Burton said she looks just like her older brother. The mum was expecting her new daughter to arrive on January 5 and said the surprise arrival at 4.04pm on New Year's Eve is a sign of things to come calling little Penelope a \"party girl in the making\".\n\nThe second-time mum spoke about the experience of being a midwife as well as a patient: \"I like it, it's like it's our turn, our time to shine!\n\n\"It's very different. We always tell women it's just a couple of more pushes, but when you're actually doing it, it's not just that.\"\n\nA few hours earlier, fellow midwife Bianca Valentine welcomed a fourth son to her busy house. She said: \"I have been a lot more nervous this time. I wasn't a midwife when I had the others. It's not as laidback when you know what's coming.\"\n\nHer new little one, Elliott, was born just before 2pm on New Year's Eve, weighing 8lb 7oz.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 14:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "THE first babies of the new decade across all of Manchester were welcomed at The Royal Bolton Hospital.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/resources/images/3052396/", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "OMG-Verify-V1": "4389-366acdfc-5224-4c07-bb70-f74d8fbfc2db", "og": {"url": "https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/18131905.meet-first-babies-born-2020-bolton/", "site_name": "The Bolton News", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/resources/images/10853590/", "width": 2400, "height": 1795}, "title": "Meet the first babies born in 2020 in Bolton", "type": "website", "name": "Meet the first babies born in 2020 in Bolton", "description": "THE first babies of the new decade across all of Manchester were welcomed at The Royal Bolton Hospital."}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/resources/images/10853590/"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Meet the first babies born in 2020 in Bolton", "description": "THE first babies of the new decade across all of Manchester were welcomed at The Royal Bolton Hospital."}, "fb": {"app_id": 100403180042168, "pages": 1455904194621834}, "medium": "news", "title": "Meet the first babies born in 2020 in Bolton", "description": "THE first babies of the new decade across all of Manchester were welcomed at The Royal Bolton Hospital."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/18131905.meet-first-babies-born-2020-bolton/"}
