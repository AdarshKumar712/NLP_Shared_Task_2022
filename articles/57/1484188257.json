He was 77.\n\nThe renowned businessman had been hospitalized after suffering a brain hemorrhage on Dec. 12 that required emergency surgery, the NBA had said at the time.\n\nStern died on New Year\u2019s Day as a result of the hemorrhage, according to a statement from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. His wife and family were with him when he died.\n\n\u201cDavid took over the NBA in 1984 with the league at a crossroads. But over the course of 30 years as Commissioner, he ushered in the modern global NBA,\u201d Silver said, crediting Stern with making the NBA a \u201ctruly global brand\u201d and calling him one of the \u201cmost influential business leaders of his generation.\u201d\n\nStern had served as commissioner of the multibillion-dollar sports operation for 30 years, succeeding Larry O\u2019Brien in 1984. He handed the reins over to then-deputy commissioner Adam Silver in 2014.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Former NBA Commissioner David Stern speaks during his induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., in 2014.\n\nDuring his three decades at the helm, he expanded the sport\u2019s popularity and digital coverage \u2015 with the NBA being the first major professional sports league to appear on cable TV \u2015 as well as expanded the league internationally \u2015 having introduced national players to international teams, and vice versa. He also allowed the first NBA players to participate in the Olympic Games in 1992, and the so-called \u201cDream Team\u201d won the gold. He also oversaw the creation of the WNBA, the NBA\u2019s women\u2019s counterpart, in 1996.\n\nThe Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, which added his name to its walls in 2014, branded him as \u201cone of the most influential commissioners in the NBA\u2019s history.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder Stern the NBA added seven new teams, and the relocation of six NBA franchises,\u201d the sports memorial\u2019s tribute to him reads. \u201cThe expansion of the global game was one of Stern\u2019s greatest accomplishments during his tenure by opening 13 global NBA offices and staged regular season games outside the U.S. which was the first ever in professional sports.\u201d\n\nDespite stepping down as commissioner in 2014, Stern remained affiliated with the NBA as commissioner emeritus. He traveled overseas on the league\u2019s behalf and did public speaking and consulting.\n\n\u201cDavid Stern is the single most important person in the history of basketball,\u201d former NBA player and broadcaster Bill Walton said at the time of Stern\u2019s resignation. \u201cHe has used basketball to make the world a better place. ... He is a master at getting to what\u2019s next.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["U.S. News", "national basketball association", "david stern", "Commissioner of the NBA"], "tags": ["What's Working: Purpose + Profit", "SHOPPING", "NBA", "Impact: This New World", "David Stern", "Finds", "HuffPost Press Room", "Commissioner Of The Nba", "Congress", "Podcasts", "U.S. News", "Impact: Project Zero", "2020 Election", "Extremism", "Donald Trump", "Social Justice"], "authors": ["Breaking News Reporter"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 16:18:50 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Stern was the NBA\u2019s longest-tenured commissioner.
