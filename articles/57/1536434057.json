Early Bird Tickets are $10 for one day, or $15 for the weekend.\n\nReflection of Mirror Lake to Rise\n\nAfter selling his Tierra Verde home, longtime local Fred Hemmer and his wife moved into the Camden Pier District, an 18-story apartment building in Downtown St. Pete. And although they traded their waterfront home for a high-rise, they viewed the move as an upgrade, \u201cDowntown has so much entertainment to offer,\u201d Hemmer says, \u201cWe were tired of always driving downtown and figured, why not just move there?\u201d\n\nNow, Hemmer is looking to use his decades of experience in banking and real estate to further transform downtown St. Pete. A group of locals, led by Hemmer, are proposing an 18-story condominium tower for the northeast corner of 3rd Ave. N. and 8th St. N. The project, named Reflection, will be located a block from Mirror Lake and will offer 77 units in a modern building with a glass facade. The building was designed by SMP Architecture. Reflection will rise 200 feet over Mirror Lake with views of the Downtown St. Pete skyline.\n\nUnlike other condominium buildings in downtown St. Pete, the top floor won\u2019t contain penthouse units. Instead, drawing on his experience living at Camden Pier District, Hemmer\u2019s plans call for a rooftop amenity deck featuring a resort style pool that will offer 360 degree views of the city.\n\nUnits at Reflection will range from 1,300-2,300 square feet with 1-3 bedrooms. Pricing is set to begin in the $600,000s, which is about 30% lower than Beach Drive prices, and will rise to around $1.3 million.\n\nAlbert Whitted Airport expansion could help fuel downtown boom located on 179 acres just south of downtown St. Petersburg, a new master plan is expected for Albert Whitted Airport by the end of 2020. A key focus of the plan likely will be a proposal to extend one of the runways further east into Tampa Bay, Rich Lesniak, airport manager, told a City Council committee.\n\nMaking that shift could allow the airport\u2019s neighbor, University of South Florida St. Petersburg, and the hospitals and businesses west of USF, to build taller buildings and employ more people in those buildings. That could create a potential economic impact of close to $400 million, according to an economic analysis. It is a general aviation airport with two runways. About 180 aircraft are based at the airport and it averages about 90,000 takeoffs and landings per year.\n\nThe last master plan for Albert Whitted was completed in 2007, and the city has since wrapped up most of the projects in that plan. About 85 percent of the $18.5 million in capital improvements from the 2007 master plan were paid for with federal and state grants.\n\nSt. Pete\u2019s future tallest building?\n\nThe New York-based Red Apple Group, can now submit a building permit application with design and construction plans to the city. The hotel, condominium and retail complex would sit on the 2.27-acreparcel south of Central Ave, between Fourth and Fifth Streets.\n\n\n\nIncluded in the complex: 45 stories of condominiums, a 20-story hotel and an 842-space parking garage. The site would also include a six-story building with office and retail space. Obstacles remain, however. Corey Malyszka, an urban design and development coordinator with the city, said the developers had not, to his knowledge, gotten approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for their 515-foot tower.\n\n\n\nWith Albert Whitted Airport nearby, that\u2019s a must. Council Member Gina Driscoll said she is concerned about how the site would interact with downtown traffic.\n\nBody Electric gym in the Warehouse Arts District\n\nThe owners of The Body Electric Yoga Co. cut the ribbon Friday on their second site, The Body Electric Athletic Co.\n\nThe nearly 16,000-square-foot facility, at 655 31st St. S. in the Warehouse Arts District, was packed with people who turned out to see the three large studios, an open gym for members, a caf\u00e9 and childcare facilities.\n\nCharge of the Soul LLC, led by co-owners Katelyn Grady and Jenny Miller, paid $840,000 for the building in July 2019, and the company has put at least $650,000 in. Wannemacher Jensen Architects designed the project, which was financed by Bank OZK. Body Electric Athletic Co., 655 31St S., St. Petersburg\n\nPINELLAS COUNTY\n\nFree tire collection event to help reduce mosquito population. Residents can drop off tires at four locations on April 18. Pinellas County is hosting a FREE tire collection event on Saturday, April 18, 9am-1pm.\n\nTires are a common breeding location for mosquitoes. They can hold water, which provides mosquitoes with the perfect location to lay eggs and grow larvae.\n\nTires will be collected at the following locations:\n\nLargo: Eagle Lake Park, 1800 Keene Road\n\nLealman: Lealman Exchange, 5175 45th St. N.\n\nPalm Harbor: John Chesnut Sr. Park, 2200 East Lake Road S.\n\nSeminole: Walsingham Park, 12615 102nd Ave. N.\n\nProof of residence in any Pinellas town or city qualifies too. No business drop-offs accepted. Residents may bring up to 12 tires of 36 inches or less in diameter with or without rims.\n\nThe collected tires will be processed through Pinellas County Solid Waste\u2019s Waste-to-Energy facility, which generates enough electricity to power approximately 45,000 homes a day. Additionally, metal from the tires will be recovered from the processed ash and recycled.\n\nFor more information, residents may call Pinellas County Mosquito Control at (727) 464-7503 or visit www.pinellascounty.org/resident/mosquito_control.htm.\n\nSunstar First Care Ambulance Membership\n\nEnroll today for ambulance coverage through March, 2021.There is still time for individuals and families to enroll in the Sunstar FirstCare Ambulance Membership program and receive medical transport cost coverage for more than a year.\n\nThe Sunstar First Care Ambulance Membership is a Pinellas County Government program that works to minimize out-of-pocket ambulance expenses. While the membership is not an insurance plan, having it can cover out-of-pocket expenses associated with copays or significantly reduce the cost of medically necessary transportation expenses for members without insurance.\n\nThe family membership covers individuals who reside in the same household related by blood, marriage or adoption. The average cost of a single transport is $746. Annual membership fees are $68 for a single membership and $103 for a family membership.\n\nCongressman Charlie Crist (D-FL) announced a $210,000 grant to the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council to support the development of a comprehensive economic development strategy for the region. Administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Economic Development Administration, this funding will double the amount being invested by Tampa Bay counties, establishing an economic development strategy for the future that supports capital investment and job creation in the region.\n\nThis EDA grant supports the development and implementation of a comprehensive economic development strategy (CEDS) for the region served by the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council, which comprises the counties of Citrus, Hernando, Hillsborough, Manatee, Pasco, and Pinellas. The CEDS process is designed to bring together the public and private sectors in the creation of an economic development roadmap to diversify and strengthen the\n\nregional economy.\n\nCrist also announced a $263,040 grant to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) to be used for the restoration of seven threatened coral species. Allocated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), these funds will allow FWC to respond to the severe decline of corals in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The funds will be used to establish two permanent field-based coral nurseries and four pop-up nurseries, to transplant nursery-reared corals onto degraded reefs, and gene banking of genotypes of these corals.\n\nTAMPA BAY & BEYOND\n\nThe Tampa Bay Vipers will play its home games at Raymond James Stadium, headquartered at Plant City Stadium where players will be housed and practices held. Tampa Bay joins Seattle, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Dallas, St. Louis and Washington, D.C. as the league\u2019s inaugural cities. Teams will have 40-man active rosters and play a 10-week season. Vince McMahon said \u201cthe game will feature simplified rules for a faster pace of game that should complete in under three hours,\u201d and will draw from former college and NFL players. On March 5, 2019, Marc Trestman was announced to be the head coach and general manager of the Tampa Bay XFL team.\n\nClyde Butcher, world renowned landscape photographer, especially of the Everglades in black & white, was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the South Florida National Parks Trust (SFNPT) at their 5th Annual Wine & Wildlife at Naples Botanical Garden late last month. \u201cThe SFNPT is a special organization to our family and we have partnered with them for many years in support of the SWAMP program. SWAMP is an environmental education program that sends Collier County 6th graders into Big Cypress National Preserve on ranger-led field trips to see their backyard and become scientists for the day. I can\u2019t think of a better organization to honor Clyde for his lifetime of conservation and educational work in support of Florida\u2019s national parks,\u201d said Clyde\u2019s daughter Jackie Butcher Obendorf.\n\nTop 15 Beaches In America\n\nFlorida is home to some of the most famous beaches in the world, according to a recent TripAdvisor Travelers\u2019 Choice Awards selection.
