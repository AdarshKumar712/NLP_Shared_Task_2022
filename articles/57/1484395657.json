(Photo: Picasa)\n\nTwo little kittens \u2014 who, sadly, lost more than their mittens \u2014 were up for adoption from the Michigan Humane Society in Detroit on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nThe 6-month-old feline sisters, Annie and Winnie, lost their sight shortly after birth when their eyes were removed because of health issues.\n\nZack, a third cat in Howell, needs an owner who will help him lose some weight.\n\nAdopting pets with special needs will require more compassion and patience, but, animal experts say, they also can provide a special joy knowing that you are giving a pet who otherwise might not have been saved a better life.\n\n\"Blind cats do just as well as sighted cats,\" said Michigan Humane Society Media Manager Anna Chrisman. \"They play, they snuggle, they hang out, they run around like crazy. They act just like normal cats, but you just have to make a couple of accommodations for them.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nDetroit doughnut shop closes its doors \u2014 but says $15,000 could prompt reopening\n\nPolice: Robert Carmack's blood alcohol content was 3 times legal limit during Oct. arrest\n\nOne accommodation: They don't do well on the stairs. Another, they need to be in a home with furniture that won't get rearranged, and, in which the owner is willing to consider setting up some textured pathways that will let the cats know where they are going because, of course, they can't see.\n\nSince they were young, the two kittens had trouble with their sight, which was causing them pain, Chrisman said. So, to help them, she added, the humane society had no choice but to completely remove their eyes.\n\nAnnie and Winnie, who are now bonded and must be adopted together, seem to have opposite personalities.\n\nAnnie, who is gray and weighs just over 3 pounds, is an \"action-packed cat,\" who is \"ready to play, play, play,\" according to her humane society description. She can \"get carried away sometimes and play too rough,\" and needs help following \"the house rules of what is acceptable.\"\n\nHowever, Winnie, a brown tabby, is just over 4 pounds and very shy. She is \"unsure of new situations,\" tends to not want to rush into any situation, is startled by noises, and when nervous, may spin in circles until calmed with gentle petting.\n\nZack, an overweight cat, is seeking an owner. (Photo: Michigan Human Society)\n\nZack, also a shorthair, is 12 years old and weighs more than 30 pounds. He is on a special diet and needs an owner, Chrisman said, who will help him get healthy and slim down by eating right and getting enough daily exercise.\n\nZack may be chunky, Chrisman said, but he's also a pretty cool cat.\n\nMore information on the cats is available at www.michiganhumane.org/cats-and-kittens or 866-MHU-MANE.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/12/31/michigan-humane-society-eyeless-kittens-adoption/2783807001/", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Frank Witsil", "Published P.M.
