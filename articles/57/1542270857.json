It was Jackson\u2019s Nevada, the moment that the party establishment realized this campaign it had long written off might just seize the nomination.\n\nAt a rally in Michigan on Sunday, Jackson will endorse Sanders ahead of a do-or-die primary for the Vermont senator.\n\nThe Michigan contest in 1988 fell on March 27. After more than three dozen primaries and caucuses, a crowded presidential field had been winnowed down to three serious contenders: Michael Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor and presumed frontrunner; Missouri Rep. Dick Gephardt; and the Rev. Jackson, a former close aide to Martin Luther King Jr., and the public bearer of the torch of the civil rights movement.\n\nJoe Biden, then a senator from Delaware, had dropped out of the race following a plagiarism scandal and dismal polling numbers.\n\nGiven Gephardt\u2019s hard-hat, working-class brand, he badly needed a win in Michigan. He threw everything he had left into the state. Dukakis, too, wanted Michigan \u2014 to show that his appeal extended beyond the liberal confines of Harvard Square, and that he could win back those Reagan Democrats whose defection had cost Jimmy Carter reelection.\n\nJackson spent that election day touring Detroit, hitting black churches and five different housing projects. The New York Times\u2019 legendary political reporter, R.W. Apple, was on hand for the last minute push. Jackson, Apple observed in his election night dispatch, \u201chad drawn surprisingly large crowds of both blacks and whites in the last few days,\u201d adding that despite the black establishment\u2019s support of Michael Dukakis \u2014 Detroit Mayor Coleman Young was backing Dukakis \u2014 Jackson won some Detroit neighborhoods by 15 or 20 to one. \u201cBut the surprise was the Chicago clergyman\u2019s powerful showing in predominantly white cities like Lansing, Flint, Kalamazoo and Battle Creek, several of which he carried.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Jackson did more than get out the black vote. Progressive whites in the state also rallied hard to his cause. (Dean Baker, now a prominent progressive economist, was district director for Jackson in Ann Arbor.)\n\nThe energy of the moment comes through in the Times dispatch. \u201cSo dramatically did [Jackson] seize the public imagination that he was able to counter successfully the notion that Mr. Dukakis was the Democrat with the best chance of nomination,\u201d the Times wrote.\n\nJackson, after 37 primaries and caucuses, was now effectively tied with Dukakis in the delegate count \u2014 a stunning moment in American politics that has gone down the memory hole.\n\nThe victory generated two polar opposite responses in Washington, D.C., and Burlington, Vermont, both of which would have profound implications for the future of the party.\n\nIn Burlington, the city\u2019s independent mayor, an outspoken supporter of Jackson, had to decide if he would engage directly with the Democratic Party in order to help Jackson win. After the Michigan victory, Bernie Sanders went all in, calling a local press conference and announcing that he would be participating in the April Democratic caucus to back Jackson. \u201cI am the only non-Democrat, non-Republican, independent progressive mayor in the United States of America. OK, it is awkward, I freely admit, it is awkward for me to walk into a Democratic Party caucus, believe me, it is awkward. I am not a Democrat. Period,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said the stakes were too high, and the opportunity too great, to stand aside on principle. Jackson, he argued, could remake the Democratic Party in an image of social justice. \u201cSo while in fact, he may end up losing some conservative white votes, some racist white votes, I think there is a real chance that he could do what [Walter] Mondale couldn\u2019t do in a million years. That is to bring millions and millions of poor people and working people into the political arena who in the past never participated.\u201d\n\n\u2018Pick up your sling shot, pick up your rock, declare our time has come, a new day has begun!\u2019 \u2014 Rev. Jesse Jackson\u2019s iconic \u2018David and Goliath\u2019 speech from 1984 is just as relevant today\n\n3526:31 PM \u2013 Feb 5, 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy165 people are talking about this\n\nIn Washington, though, the reaction was pandemonium. Just as party leaders melted down publicly after Sanders\u2019s win in the Nevada caucuses, they did so after Jackson\u2019s triumph in Michigan. Talk in the top echelons of the Democratic Party turned to panic, with David Espo of the Associated Press reporting that the establishment feared a general-election blowout if Jackson was the nominee. Plans were being drawn up, he reported, to draft New York Governor Mario Cuomo to challenge Jackson at the convention if Dukakis couldn\u2019t stop the reverend.\n\nE.J. Dionne, then reporting for the New York Times, captured the sense of dread.\n\nWhite Democratic leaders who do not support Mr. Jackson admitted they were in a quandary, wondering how to confront the growing movement toward Mr. Jackson without appearing to be racist and without alienating the large core of activists, including many white liberals, that he has attracted\u2026. Around Washington, the words used by leading white Democrats to describe their party\u2019s situation included crisis, disarray, disaster, consternation, mess, and wacky. \u201cYou\u2019ve never heard a sense of panic sweep the party as it has in the last few days,\u201d said David Garth, an adviser to Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee. Mr. Garth predicted that \u2018\u201dthe anti-Jackson constituency, when the reality of his becoming President seeps in, may be a much bigger constituency than there is out there right now.\u201d\n\nJackson, the Democratic political class argued, was simply unelectable, so the party should go with a winner like Dukakis. Rep. Barney Frank\u2019s sister, Ann Lewis, was working for the Jackson campaign, but Frank was backing his home state governor. He explained to Dionne that there were two reasons Jackson couldn\u2019t win. \u201cOne, there is unfortunately still racism in the country\u2026.That doesn\u2019t mean the whole country\u2019s prejudiced. It means that if there\u2019s an irreducible 15 or 20 percent prejudice against a particular group, you\u2019re giving away an awful lot,\u201d Frank said. \u201cTwo, he\u2019s still to the left of the country, especially on foreign policy.\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s opponents had argued that his proximity to the nomination would paradoxically push some white Democrats away from him. It\u2019s all fine and good to vote for the charismatic black guy with the unifying message in 1988 \u2014 indeed, it was an anti-racist badge of honor \u2014 just not if he actually might win. The party establishment pulled the fire alarm. I asked Jackson, in an interview for my recent book We\u2019ve Got People, what kind of pressure he felt after his Michigan win. \u201cThe pressure was not on me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the so-called Reagan Democrats who began sewing discord and spreading lies.\u201d\n\nAt the April Democratic caucus in Vermont, Sanders spoke on Jackson\u2019s behalf. The interloper\u2019s speech did not go over well with every Democrat. As he headed back to his seat, a woman in the audience slapped him across the face, he later recounted in his 1997 book, \u201cOutsider in the House.\u201d\n\n\u201cBernie represents direction not complexion. He stood up for me in \u201988 and we won Vermont \u2014 the whitest state in the country,\u201d Jackson recently recalled to Jeremy Scahill. On the back of the progressive coalition Sanders had organized in Vermont, Jackson won the Vermont caucuses 46 to 45 percent.\n\nOutside of Vermont, it didn\u2019t go as well. Jackson had been polling ahead in the next state on the calendar, Wisconsin, but the party consolidation behind Dukakis, fueled by the panic, flipped the momentum, and Dukakis took the state.\n\nOver the next month, Dukakis would win Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio and Indiana, and while Jackson continued picking off a state here and some delegates there, the nomination contest was effectively over. As is often the case, political wisdom failed the party elite, and Dukakis was crushed by the unpopular George H.W. Bush.\n\nJackson\u2019s endorsement comes in the wake of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s departure from the race. \u201cI will not go against Bernie, but I\u2019ve not made a decision to endorse anybody,\u201d Jackson said in a February episode of Intercepted. \u201cAnd when we talk, I share with him observations. Same with Warren, share observations. I\u2019m not endorsing either one at this point.\u201d\n\nBut Jackson was clear on who he would not be supporting. \u201cI think the idea that somehow Biden has largely inherited the black vote in South Carolina is not sound judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were saying no to Clarence Thomas, he said, yes, to Clarence Thomas. We were saying no to the Crime Bill. He said yes to the Crime Bill. No to the Iraq War. He said yes to the Iraq war. He\u2019s on a different side of history. It\u2019s his right to be there but he might as well own up to his side of history.\u201d\n\nJackson said that Biden had taken on the aura of Obama, though that misunderstood the role Biden had played on the Obama\u2019s ticket. \u201cJoe Biden is seen as connected to Barack. He was put on the ticket to balance the ticket not to enhance it. Barack was against the Iraq war. He was for the Iraq war. Barack was against the Crime Bill. He was for the Crime Bill. Barack was supporting Anita Hill and Biden let Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court as a monument to his leadership in that committee. So his proximity to Barack gives the impression he is active in Civil Rights is clearer than it is,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBiden was Barack\u2019s right-wing. With Barack out, there\u2019s nothing left but the right-wing.\u201d\n\nBiden isn\u2019t offering a vision that meets the moment, Jackson said. \u201cHis message does not address the pain of our people. I\u2019m not sure what moderate means if people don\u2019t have affordable healthcare. I\u2019m not sure what moderate, \u2018I\u2019m a moderate\u2019 means to us. In fact, it means very little to us,\u201d he said.\n\nJust as Biden isn\u2019t moderate, Jackson argued, Sanders isn\u2019t on the left. \u201cWhat Sanders represents is not the left-wing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the moral center. Healthcare for everybody is moral. Education even for the poor without student loan debt is the moral center. Middle East policy where you recognize Israel and Palestine is the moral center.\u201d\n\nRyan Grim is the author of the book We\u2019ve Got People: From Jesse Jackson to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the End of Big Money and the Rise of a MovementWAIT!
