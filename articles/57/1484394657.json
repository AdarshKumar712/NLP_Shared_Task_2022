The officer said he will be taken to the Trichy GH to confirm if he is fit to travel to Tirunelveli, where he will be produced before the judicial magistrate. If doctors say he cannot travel so long, he will be produced before a judicial magistrate in Trichy. \u201cIn either case, we will act on the directions of the magistrate. We will hospitalise him or remand him in jail under judicial custody as they say,\u201d he said.As he was arrested, BJP workers raised slogans against Kannan while SDPI cadres condemned the arrest. When he was taken out of the guest house, some protesters attempted to throw slippers at him.On Monday night, the Melapalayam police booked him under Sections 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 505(i)(b) (intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the state or against public tranquillity), and 505 (ii) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) of the IPC.On Tuesday afternoon, Kannan was taken to a private hospital in Tirunelveli as he complained of chest pain. He had to be discharged in an hour as there was a strong protest by BJP cadres on the hospital premises. His family claimed that he will be taken to a hospital in Madurai but maintained confidentiality over the place fearing protest by BJP cadres.Police said Kannan\u2019s family took him to Madurai on Tuesday and then to Perambalur, where he was arrested due to pressure following the protest by senior BJP functionaries on the Marina on Wednesday. BJP national secretary H Raja, L Ganesan, C P Radhakrishnan and Pon Radhakrishnan along with 100 party workers were arrested for the sit-in protest in front of Gandhi statue on the Marina beach front. They had set a 24-hour deadline for the TN police to arrest him.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Madurai news", "Madurai latest news", "Madurai news live", "Madurai news today", "Today news Madurai", "writer \u2018Nellai\u2019 Kannan", "tirunelveli city police", "TIRUNELVELI", "provocative speech against Prime Minister", "nellai kannan", "Madurai news", "madurai", "CAA Protest Latest News", "BJP"], "tags": ["Delhi Air Pollution", "Delhi Smog", "Fire in Mumbai", "writer \u2018Nellai\u2019 Kannan", "Tirunelveli", "Mumbai Rains", "Madurai", "Bangalore Temperature", "Hyderabad Rain", "BJP", "Tirunelveli city police", "Srinagar encounter", "Chennai Weather", "Delhi Temperature"], "authors": ["Tnn"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Orator and writer \u2018Nellai\u2019 Kannan, who was booked for his \u2018provocative speech\u2019 against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, chief mi", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Orator and writer \u2018Nellai\u2019 Kannan, who was booked for his \u2018provocative speech\u2019 against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, chief mi", "keywords": "Madurai news, Madurai latest news, Madurai news live, Madurai news today, Today news Madurai,writer \u2018Nellai\u2019 Kannan,tirunelveli city police,TIRUNELVELI,provocative speech against Prime Minister,nellai kannan,Madurai news,madurai,CAA Protest Latest News,BJP", "robots": "NOODP", "og": {"title": "CAA Protest Latest News: \u2018Nellai\u2019 Kannan held after protest by BJP leaders | Madurai News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/madurai-nellai-kannan-held-after-protest-by-bjp-leaders/articleshow/73064705.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064733,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-602520,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "Orator and writer \u2018Nellai\u2019 Kannan, who was booked for his \u2018provocative speech\u2019 against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, chief mi", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/madurai-nellai-kannan-held-after-protest-by-bjp-leaders/articleshow/73064705.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064733,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-602520,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "CAA Protest Latest News: \u2018Nellai\u2019 Kannan held after protest by BJP leaders | Madurai News - Times of India", "description": "Orator and writer \u2018Nellai\u2019 Kannan, who was booked for his \u2018provocative speech\u2019 against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, chief mi", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "news_keywords": "writer \u2018Nellai\u2019 Kannan,tirunelveli city police,TIRUNELVELI,provocative speech against Prime Minister,nellai kannan,Madurai news,madurai,CAA Protest Latest News,BJP", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/madurai-nellai-kannan-held-after-protest-by-bjp-leaders/articleshow/73064705.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 227797153941209, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/madurai-nellai-kannan-held-after-protest-by-bjp-leaders/articleshow/73064705.cms"}
