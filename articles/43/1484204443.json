Moreno shared the grand marshal title with Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez and actress Gina Torres, but Moreno \u2014 who has won all four of the major annual American entertainment awards with an Oscar, Emmy, Grammy and Tony \u2014 won fans\u2019 hearts with her infectious energy.\n\nMoreno stood and danced in her parade vehicle as it made its way down most if not all of the parade route. She also caught the attention of a nearby TV camera, got close to it and introduced her grandsons, who were riding alongside her.\n\n#RoseParade grand marshal \u2066@TheRitaMoreno\u2069 gives one of my favorite quotes as she boards her #roseparade2020 car: \u201cWe\u2019re off like a herd of turtles.\u201d (i am now a fan for life) pic.twitter.com/pfWBFnTtd7 \u2014 Ryan Carter (@ryinie) January 1, 2020\n\nLos Lobos performing \u201cLa Bamba\u201d\n\nWhile the crowd on Orange Grove Boulevard just before the turn onto Colorado Boulevard was excited to see Los Lobos as they prepared to perform the closing musical number for the 2020 Rose Parade, its excitement increased significantly when the band performed its version of \u201cLa Bamba,\u201d which stayed atop the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks in 1987. The song was recorded for the film of the same name about musician Richie Valens, played by Lou Diamond Phillips. The song also topped the U.K. Singles chart, and its music video won the 1988 MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film.\n\nFans got up and danced at their seats and sang along during the performance.\n\nThe Cowboy Channel\u2019s live bull rider\n\nThe Cowboy Channel\u2019s \u201cWalk. Ride. Rodeo.\u201d float caught the audience\u2019s attention for several reasons \u2014 it launched fireworks, and it played the song \u201cOld Town Road\u201d by Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, which got the crowd singing along \u2014 but the main reason was because a person was riding a mechanical bull atop the float for the duration of the parade. The bull bucked slowly, likely as to not throw its rider down to the pavement, but the crowd remained enthralled by the performance.\n\nAlso riding the float was Amberley Snyder, a nationally ranked rodeo barrel racer who survived a devastating car crash that left her paralyzed below the waist in 2010. Snyder defied the odds to return to the sport she loves and now is a motivational speaker.\n\nDonate Life\u2019s \u201cLight in the Darkness\u201d float\n\nEvery year, Donate Life highlights organ, eye and tissue donors and recipients with its float. Those remembrances regularly evoke emotion, especially on social media.\n\nOhio Governor Mike DeWine highlighted he and wife Fran DeWine\u2019s participating in last year\u2019s Donate Life float by honoring the 421 Ohioans who were donors then.\n\nToday, is the Rose Parade in Pasadena! @FranDeWine and I were honored to sign one of the rose vials that\u2019s on the Donate Life float. Last year, 421 Ohioans shared the gift of life through organ donation, and our rose honors those individuals and their tremendous gift. #DonateLife pic.twitter.com/UYy6mxSMyg \u2014 Mike DeWine (@MikeDeWine) January 1, 2020\n\nWriter Rachel Brougham tweeted that a rose portrait on this year\u2019s float was dedicated to her late husband, Colin Brougham.\n\nAwhile ago, I received a letter from Donate Life, telling me there was a rose on their float in the Rose Parade in honor of Colin. I forgot about it until I turned on the TV at the exact moment that float was on. I\u2019ll take that as a sign. We miss you, Colin. You should be here. \u2014 Rachel Brougham (@RachelBrougham) January 1, 2020\n\nA couple from Georgia tweeted out that one of them was a donor tissue recipient and is a registered donor.\n\nThis float was GORGEOUS\u2026.and HUMBLING\u2026I\u2019m a donor tissue recipient and registered donor\u2026wonderful work for all who put this together\u2026heart goes out to the HEROS who donated so that others can live\u2764\ufe0f #DonateLife #DonateLifeFloat #BeADonor #RoseParade2020 \u2014 Dave & Laurie \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@DavelaurieC) January 1, 2020\n\nMarching bands from near and far\n\nMarching bands are a staple of the Rose Parade, but this year\u2019s entrants seemed to delight crowds more than in years past. Many locals from across Southern California were on hand to cheer on the Alhambra Unified School District Marching Band, the Los Angeles Unified School District High School Honor Band, the Pasadena City College Tournament of Roses Honor Band and the Rancho Verde High School Crimson Regiment.\n\nOther high school bands from around the country impressed, and the many international bands in attendance \u2014 from Costa Rica, Denmark, El Salvador, Japan, Mexico and Puerto Rico \u2014 each brought their own unique styles that delighted audiences.\n\nHowever, the standout band was Southern University\u2019s \u201cHuman Jukebox\u201d marching band, which wowed those in attendance with its power and precision in playing local favorite tune \u201cI Love LA\u201d by Randy Newman.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["top stories rdf", "Rose Parade", "Top Stories PSN", "Top Stories SGVT", "Top Stories WDN", "Top Stories LBPT", "Top Stories LADN", "top stories sun", "Top Stories OCR", "Top Stories Breeze", "Top Stories PE", "top stories ivdb"], "authors": ["Christopher Yee"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cropped-ocr_icon11.jpg?w=32", "meta_data": {"application-name": "orangecountyregister", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "wp-parsely_version": "1.14", "fb": {"pages": 6883399629}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The top 5 moments from the 2020 Rose Parade", "url": "http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/the-top-five-moments-from-the-2020-rose-parade", "description": "The parade was filled with its usual pageantry and history on a sunny, warm New Year\u2019s Day.", "site_name": "Orange County Register", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/PAS-L-PARADE-LIVE-0102-KD_030-1-1.jpg?w=1024&h=771", "width": 1024, "height": 771}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered", "published_time": "2020-01-01T22:39:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T23:39:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "cgpEpd98F7xFS0-WkGzGDc2KVzggxgQbOZaXRXYT61o", "twitter": {"text": {"title": "The top 5 moments from the 2020 Rose Parade"}, "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/PAS-L-PARADE-LIVE-0102-KD_030-1-1.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cropped-ocr_icon11.jpg?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/the-top-five-moments-from-the-2020-rose-parade"}
