But he declined to say if ministry officials would meet with the social affairs ministry.\n\n\u201cWhen we finish the inspection, we will submit a report to the prime minister for him to make a decision,\u201d Channarin said.\n\nIn August, Khmer Rise Party president Sok Sovann Vathana Sabung, who is a Council member, submitted a report to Hun Sen on the school\u2019s predicament and sought the prime minister\u2019s intervention in the matter.\n\nOn Tuesday, he told The Post that he welcomed the quick action taken by the Ministry of National Assembly-Senate Relations and Inspection and that he would follow the case with interest.\n\n\u201cThe ministry must solve the problem as pointed out by the government. I will try my best to protect this school. I have been doing so since I received its complaint,\u201d he said.\n\nSocial affairs ministry spokesman Touch Channy said on Tuesday that his ministry also welcomed the investigation and was preparing documents to defend its decision.\n\nHe said the relocation order had been revoked but the land was not to be sold as per the accusation by some parties.\n\n\u201cMy ministry is not too concerned about the investigation as we have enough documentation and have prepared our reports with [a land] title and clear reasons.\n\n\u201cThe government has ordered the Ministry of National Assembly-Senate Relation and Inspection to check the place. We also want to see the report and determination of which side is right and wrong,\u201d Channy said.\n\nHe said the government had to decide after the inspection if it wanted to hand over the land to the school or otherwise.\n\nSchool of Hope principal Phum Narith told The Post recently that it had been located on about 1.5ha since 2002. But the social affairs ministry told its director, who was a foreign national and unable to speak Khmer, to sign on a document written in the language.\n\nThe document told the school to sell the land.\n\nThe School of Hope is a branch of the Assemblies of God (NGO) which has been operating in Preah Sihanouk for some 20 years. It has accommodated and provided education to about 70,000 students and 50 teachers thus far.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Contact Author"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Following an order from Prime Minister Hun Sen, Minister of National Assembly-Senate Relations and Inspection Men Sam An on Wednesday visited the School of Hope, located on a 1ha plot in Preah Sihanouk province.
