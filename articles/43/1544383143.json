In one case, a woman in Wuhan, China, passed the virus to five family members without ever getting sick herself.\n\nThe Grand Princess arrived in Oakland on Monday after sitting off the coast of the San Francisco Bay Area for four days while officials planned what to do with its passengers. As of Monday night, 407 passengers had left the ship and begun traveling to US military bases for quarantine. Non-US citizens were put onto charter flights.\n\nTwo passengers who tested positive for the new coronavirus were transferred to local hospitals.\n\nIt's expected to take a few more days to unload the rest of the passengers. Once they have all left the ship, the Grand Princess plans to leave the San Francisco Bay with its entire crew onboard. It is unclear where the ship will go after that.\n\n\"Plans for a crew quarantine are still being determined,\" Princess Cruises said in the email.\n\nAn on-ship quarantine in Japan failed, especially for crew members\n\nCrew members aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship at the Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama port, February 24, 2020. More\n\nKazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty\n\nThe Grand Princess cruise ship is from the same line as the Diamond Princess, which hosted one of the largest outbreaks of the new coronavirus outside of China.\n\nThe ship sat in the port of Yokohama, Japan, for about three weeks in February as the local government placed everyone on board under quarantine. In the end, more than 700 people who were on the Diamond Princess tested positive for the new coronavirus.\n\nExperts have criticized the Japanese government's decision to keep passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess, and some have said the quarantine procedures may have even helped the virus spread.\n\n\"I'd like to sugarcoat it and try to be diplomatic about it, but it failed,\" Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told USA Today. \"People were getting infected on that ship. Something went awry.\"\n\nCrew members were especially at risk, since they still had to share cabins, bring food to passengers, and eat together in a mess hall.\n\nA crew member moves about the passageways of the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess on February 9, 2020, in Yokohama, Japan.

One of them, Binay Kumar Sarkar, told Business Insider that the situation on the ship was \"out of control.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Mmcfalljohnsen Businessinsider.Com", "Morgan Mcfall-Johnsen"], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 10 21:22:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "More than 1,000 crew members will stay on the ship as it sails back into the Pacific Ocean.
