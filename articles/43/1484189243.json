Join the political revolution at ...\n\n(Image by YouTube, Channel: Bernie Sanders) Details DMCA\n\n\n\nWhat better way for Bernie campaigners to end 2020 with a citation of one of the aspects of his campaign that he has worked hardest on: ENDORSEMENTS!\n\n\n\nIn 2016, I did a similar article, and so therefore, this year, I am doing the first of what I hope will be many more, leading to Bernie's victory in November!\n\n\n\nSince 2016, I have noticed some profound progress, especially in the number of legislators in South Carolina supporting him. This bodes well for a crucial Bernie victory in the South Carolina primary, which would be extremely significant in the over scheme of things.\n\n\n\nIf you are from Oregon, remember that US Senator Jeff Merkley endorsed Bernie in 2016 in the New York Times; please ask him to do this again, and please do it soon!\n\n\n\nOne thing that profoundly concerns me is the paucity of newspaper endorsements thus far, which to me is a very big deal, one that readers could correct and improve by writing to their local regional and hometown newspapers, ASKING THEM DIRECTLY TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE.\n\nI believe this could be done now, not waiting till a week before your state's primary. The momentum builds and vis-a-vis the editorial pages of America; this truly is vital, and it doesn't cost any campaign disbursements.\n\n\n\nThe person reading the letters to editors before they are published is most often the person who writes the endorsements, or is alternatively on the editorial board that makes the endorsement just before the primary election.\n\nI encourage you to watch the following 66-minute video of Bernie speaking with the Editorial Board of the Des Moines Register, the largest paper in the first primary state. See also my article introducing this aspect of Bernie's campaign with which you can become directly involved with your own short letter to the editor asking for the endorsement of the papers in your area!\n\nhttps://www.opednews.com/articles/Bernie-s-Brilliant-Des-Moi-by-Stephen-Fox-Battle-For-The-Editorial-Pages-Of-America_Des-Moines-Register_Editorial-Boards-Of-American-Newspapers_Editorial-Page-Endorsements-191222-740.html\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.\n\nFederal officials U.S. Senators Current\n\nPatrick Leahy, U.S. Senator from Vermont (1975-present), president pro tempore of the United States Senate (2012-15), president pro tempore emeritus of the United States Senate (2015-present)\n\nFormer\n\nMike Gravel, former U.S. Senator from Alaska (1969-81), Democratic candidate for president in 2008 and 2020 (co-endorsement)\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Page 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Battle For The Editorial Pages Of America", "Bernie Sanders 2020", "Bernie Sanders 2020 Endorsements", "Bernie Sanders Endorsements", "Des Moines Register", "Editorial Page Endorsements"], "tags": ["Des Moines Register", "Editorial Page Endorsements", "Battle For The Editorial Pages Of America", "Bernie Sanders 2020 Endorsements", "Bernie Sanders 2020", "Bernie Sanders Endorsements"], "authors": ["Stephen Fox"], "publish_date": "Thu Dec 19 15:00:00 2030", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Article: List of Bernie Sanders' 2020 Presidential Campaign Endorsements - The person reading the letters to editors is often the person who writes the endorsements, or is on the editorial board making endorsements just before the primary election.
