Kennedy, and her son Gideon went missing late Thursday afternoon after they took a canoe to retrieve a ball that had gone into the bay.\n\nThe McKean family left their home in Washington D.C. to self-quarantine at Maeve\u2019s mother\u2019s home on the Chesapeake Bay. According to Maeve\u2019s husband David, Maeve and Gideon were playing kickball behind the house when one of them kicked the ball into the water.\n\n\u201cThe cove is protected, with much calmer wind and water than in the greater Chesapeake. They got into a canoe, intending simply to retrieve the ball, and somehow got pushed by wind or tide into the open bay,\u201d McKean wrote. \u201cAbout 30 minutes later they were spotted by an onlooker from land, who saw them far out from shore, and called the police. After that last sighting, they were not seen again. The Coast Guard recovered their canoe, which was capsized and miles away, at approximately 6:30 [Friday] evening.\u201d\n\nMcKean\u2019s husband, David, shared a heartfelt post to Facebook saying that despite efforts to rescue Maeve and Gideon, the decision was made to suspend rescue efforts.\n\n\u201c\u2026the decision has now been made to suspend the active rescue effort. The search that began yesterday afternoon went on throughout the night and continued all day today,\u201d David McKean wrote. \u201cIt has been more than 24 hours, and the chances they have survived are impossibly small. It is clear that Maeve and Gideon have passed away.\u201d\n\nMcKean\u2019s mother, former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, issued a statement following her daughter\u2019s disappearance, saying:\n\n\u201cWith profound sadness, I share the news that the search for my beloved daughter Maeve and grandson Gideon has turned from rescue to recovery,\u201d Townsend said in a statement. \u201cMy heart is crushed, yet we shall try to summon the grace of God and what strength we have to honor the hope, energy and passion that Maeve and Gideon set forth into the world. My family thanks all for the outpouring of love and prayers as we grieve and try to bear this devastating loss.\u201d\n\nI am writing here to address the countless people who have loved my wife Maeve and my son Gideon. As many of you have\u2026 Posted by David McKean on Friday, April 3, 2020 Maeve Kennedy McKean was also mother to two other children: Gabriella (7) and Toby (2 1/2). Our thoughts and prayers are with Maeve and Gideon\u2019s family during this heartbreaking time. Read David McKean\u2019s full statement below.\n\nNow On Spotify!
