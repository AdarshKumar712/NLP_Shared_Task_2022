Associated Press\n\nHONG KONG -- The United States condemned the arrests of at least 14 veteran pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong on charges of joining massive anti-government protests last year, saying the police action jeopardizes a high degree of autonomy guaranteed the southern Chinese city.\n\nAmong those arrested Saturday were 81-year-old activist and former lawmaker Martin Lee and democracy advocates Albert Ho, Lee Cheuk-yan and Au Nok-hin. Police also arrested media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who founded the local newspaper Apple Daily.\n\nThe sweeping crackdown amid a coronavirus pandemic is based on charges of unlawful assembly stemming from huge rallies against proposed China extradition legislation that exposed deep divisions between democracy-minded Hong Kongers and the Communist Party-ruled central government in Beijing.\n\nThe bill - which would have allowed the residents of the semi-autonomous Chinese territory to be sent to mainland to stand trial - has been withdrawn, but the protests continued for more than seven months, centered around demands for voting rights and an independent inquiry into police conduct.\n\nWhile the protests began peacefully, they increasingly descended into violence after demonstrators became frustrated with the government's response. They feel that Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has ignored their demands and used the police to suppress them.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a statement condemned the arrests.\n\n'\u009cBeijing and its representatives in Hong Kong continue to take actions inconsistent with commitments made under the Sino-British Joint Declaration that include transparency, the rule of law, and guarantees that Hong Kong will continue to '\u0098enjoy a high degree of autonomy,'\" Pompeo said. He was referring to the 1997 handover of the former British colony to China, which promised the city would enjoy political freedoms not afforded mainland China.\n\nAttorney General William Barr also weighed in with a statement saying these events show how \"antithetical the values of the Chinese Communist Party are to those we share in Western liberal democracies. These actions - along with its malign influence activity and industrial espionage here in the United States - demonstrate once again that the Chinese Communist Party cannot be trusted.'\u009d\n\nBritain's Foreign Office also criticized the arrests, saying '\u009cthe right to peaceful protest is fundamental to Hong Kong's way of life and as such is protected in both the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.'\u009d\n\nBeijing has accused the U.S. and other Western countries of instigating the protests and insists they're China's internal affairs.\n\nThe Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong said police were enforcing the law against those suspected of organizing and participating in unauthorized assemblies, and foreign countries have no right to interfere, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\n'\u009cIt is completely wrong that the U.K. Foreign Office spokesperson has distorted the truth by painting unauthorized assemblies as '\u0098peaceful protests,' in a bid to whitewash, condone and exonerate the anti-China troublemakers in Hong Kong,\" the statement said.\n\nLai, Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum - a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party who was also arrested - were charged in February over their involvement in a rally on Aug. 31 last year.\n\nThe Hong Kong authorities had denied permission for most of the rallies and police increasingly used tear gas and pepper spray against demonstrators, arresting hundreds.\n\nThe League of Social Democrats wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday that its leaders were among those arrested, including chairman Raphael Wong. They were accused of participating in two unauthorized protests on Aug. 18 and Oct. 1 last year.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["News", "Nation/World", "Associated Press"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Associated Press", "Zen Soo"], "publish_date": "Sat Apr 18 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The United States and Britain have condemned the arrests of at least 14 veteran pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong on charges of joining massive anti-government protests last year", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.dailyherald.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "News, Nation/World, Associated Press", "description": "The United States and Britain have condemned the arrests of at least 14 veteran pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong on charges of joining massive anti-government protests last year", "robots": "noarchive", "author": "Associated Press", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@dailyherald", "url": "https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20200418/news/304189986", "title": "US, UK condemn Hong Kong arrests of democracy advocates", "description": "The United States and Britain have condemned the arrests of at least 14 veteran pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong on charges of joining massive anti-government protests last year", "image": "https://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20200418/news/304189986/AR/0/AR-304189986.jpg&updated=202004191931&imageversion=Facebook&exactH=630&exactW=1200&exactfit=crop&noborder", "account_id": 8960722}, "og": {"title": "US, UK condemn Hong Kong arrests of democracy advocates", "description": "The United States and Britain have condemned the arrests of at least 14 veteran pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong on charges of joining massive anti-government protests last year", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20200418/news/304189986", "image": "https://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20200418/news/304189986/EP/1/8/EP-304189986.jpg&updated=202004191931&imageversion=Facebook&exactH=630&exactW=1200&exactfit=crop&noborder", "site_name": "Daily Herald"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHeraldFans", "published_time": "2020-04-18", "modified_time": "2020-04-19T23:31:00Z"}, "fb": {"app_id": 105603449548761}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20200418/news/304189986"}
