In the midst of the event, a man with a machete entered the home and wounded five people.\n\nSaturday was the seventh night of Hanukkah, the Jewish eight-day wintertime \u201cfestival of lights.\u201d\n\nIn response to the attack, Sachs began using the hashtag \u201clight against hate\u201d on different social media platforms to show solidarity with, and support for, its victims. The concept has spread across North America over the last 20 hours.\n\nAccording to Sachs, he has received an outpouring of love and support since launching the campaign.\n\n\u201cEvery synagogue in Vancouver used that hashtag,\u201d said Sachs, adding that the idea has also gained support from the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver.\n\n\u201cWe are hearing and reading about the hatred towards the Jewish community, but in Richmond and across Canada, many people who are non-Jewish are standing up and saying, \u2018no,\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to all those who try to bring more light into the world and drive out the darkness.\u201d\n\nAlso joining the event on Sunday night were Ezra S. Shanken, CEO with the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, Richmond councilor Chak Au and Bill McNulty and B.C.
