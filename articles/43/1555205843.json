There is one exception: The inauguration of BER Airport stands.\n\nGood news are hard to find while the world is falling apart due to the Coronavirus. While Lufthansa, Germany\u2019s flag carrier and the largest airline in Europe, needs help from the state to avoid bankruptcy since it was hit by the virus too, the new and shiny airport it intends to use in Brandenburg, just outside Berlin, will be inaugurated soon.\n\nRecently, two check-in counters were tested. Photo: Imanuel Marcus\n\nTerminal 2 to be Opened Too\n\nIt gets better: Not only BER\u2019s elegant Terminal 1 will be ready to rumble on October 31st, 2020, but also Terminal 2, according to Zechbau, the company that is building it. At this moment, the extension to the new airport with the official name \u2018Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg Willy Brandt\u2019 looks more like the sarcophagus around the radiating Chernobyl power plant, but that will change.\n\nTerminal 2 will supposedly be ready on time. Photo: Imanuel Marcus\n\nEngelbert L\u00fctke Daldup, the CEO of \u2018Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH\u2019, the airport\u2019s operator, confirmed what many may still not believe, because of the nine-year delay the airport already has: It will actually happen this fall. If there was no Coronavirus, it would be time to pack bikinis and beer bottle openers, and to fly out of BER, into the sun.\n\nOur reporter found an open cable. Photo: Imanuel Marcus\n\nApproval for Dowels\n\nThere is actually one more event that has not been cancelled, namely the rehearsals. In summer, as many as 20,000 volunteers will test the baggage systems at BER, they will go through trial evacuations, cause a mess at the gate, try to find their way and ask stupid questions. It will obviously feel like the usual situation at any major airport.\n\nElegant, more elegant, BER. Photo: Imanuel Marcus\n\nAccording to Professor L\u00fctke Daldup, the main technical issues the construction site referred to as BER Airport had have been resolved by now. Those include problems with thousands of dowels. The latter needed a special approval from the authorities. In front of a committee at Berlin\u2019s House of Representatives, L\u00fctke Daldup confirmed this hurdle was out of the way.\n\nEngelbert L\u00fctke Daldup (right) is proud of his new airport. Photo: Imanuel Marcus\n\nWiring Systems Operative\n\nAn even bigger issue which had contributed to the airport\u2019s nine-year delay will be resolved by the end of March, he insisted. This one is about the wiring system the problems with which have given many people headaches and sleepless nights. Germany\u2019s Technical Control Board (T\u00dcV) would approve the system this month, Engelbert L\u00fcdtke Daldrup assured the commission members. It was fully operative.\n\nThere is a lot of room in Terminal 1. Photo: Imanuel Marcus\n\nOnce they have the green light, \u2018Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH\u2019 will officially declare the completion of the airport at the Regulatory Authority for Constructions. If everything goes as planned, the opening date in October will not be changed. It coincides with L\u00fcdtke Daldrup\u2019s 64th birthday.\n\nBER will supposedly opened on October 31st. Photo: Imanuel Marcus\n\nHuge Capacity\n\nEngelbert L\u00fcdtke Daldrup needs to be an optimist. It is his job, especially after those nine years of delay. That is why the committee also wanted confirmations from the company in charge of the construction itself. They got those.\n\nThey even included abstract art. Photo: Imanuel Marcus\n\nBER Airport\u2019s Terminal 1 was built to service 28 million passengers per year. Terminal 2 will increase that number to 34 million. Today\u2019s Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport will be converted to BER\u2019s Terminal 5 in October. All in all, the capacity will be enough to accommodate 36 million passengers, half a million more than Berlin\u2019s Tegel Airport and Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport had in 2019, combined.\n\nThere are countless nice perspectives at BER. Photo: Imanuel Marcus\n\nExpensive Parking Lot\n\nNow that BER will provide a capacity this big, it might not be needed anymore. The Coronavirus crisis is destroying the airlines. Lufthansa is now using BER\u2019s tarmac to park some of its aircraft. They are not needed anymore, at least for now. So they are filling Germany\u2019s most expensive parking lot.\n\nThese suitcases are being used for rehearsals.
