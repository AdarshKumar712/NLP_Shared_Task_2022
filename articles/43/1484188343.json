This was welcome as international visitors are known to spend more than domestic visitors.\n\nHe pointed out that the growth in visitor numbers in 2019 followed some important additions including adding a second ferry, procured from the south of France, and a new walk-on pontoon which replaced previous steps in Cobh.\n\nHe said the new \u201cIndependence\u201d exhibition, telling the story of the 1,400 prisoners held on the island in 1921 during the War of Independence, also opened on the island and proved highly successful.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, there are plans to add a covered ticket office at Kennedy Pier in Cobh, a calendar of concerts and events along with a new exhibition telling the story of the Famine-era convicts who did not survive the island prison experience.\u201d\n\nUpward trend\n\nMr Crotty said that with these new exhibitions and events and an extension of the opening season to seven days a week from April to October, they hope to see the upward trend in visitor numbers continue into 2020.\n\nHe pointed out that the former island prison and fortress had only reopened in June 2016, following \u20ac6.5 million of investment by Cork County Council and Failte Ireland.\n\nThat investment saw the reopening of the Famine-era prison, the 9.7-hectare (24 acre) island fortress, the modern prison, which only closed in 2004, and scenic walking trails around the outer island, as well as a cafe and gift shop on site.\n\n\u201cWe currently have a funding application with F\u00e1ilte Ireland, with plans to add a social village recreation of island life, a \u2018dungeon\u2019-style experience in the fort tunnels and an international welcome hub at the island pier.\u201d\n\nIn October 2017, Spike Island was named as Europe\u2019s leading tourist attraction at the prestigious World Travel Awards.\n\nLast November, Spike Island scooped another prestigious award, being named Best Attraction at the International Travel and Tourism Awards 2019 held in London.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Site manager new war exhibition behind former Cork prison\u2019s rising popularity", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/assets/images/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "Site manager new war exhibition behind former Cork prison\u2019s rising popularity", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14128325"}, "news_keywords": "News, Barry Roche, John Crotty, Spike In Visitors, Spike Island, Cork County Council, F\u00e1ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Roche, Southern Correspondent, Cobh, Europe, France, Ireland, London(GB), United Kingdom", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "Spike Island visitor numbers treble in three years", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/spike-island-visitor-numbers-treble-in-three-years-1.4128325", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "Site manager new war exhibition behind former Cork prison\u2019s rising popularity", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4128321&origw=1440", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4128321&origw=1440", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimes", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/spike-island-visitor-numbers-treble-in-three-years-1.4128325", "title": "Spike Island visitor numbers treble in three years", "description": "Site manager new war exhibition behind former Cork prison\u2019s rising popularity", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128321.1577896227!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/spike-island-visitor-numbers-treble-in-three-years-1.4128325"}
