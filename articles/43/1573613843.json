Now, it appears that early, aggressive testing could have prevented the widespread infections that currently plague the country.\n\nDr Adriana Heguy, a member of the research team at NYU, said \"people were just oblivious.\"\n\n\"It was a disaster that we didn't do testing,\" she said.\n\nThe first steps President Donald Trump took to fight the virus in the US was to enact travel bans, but those did not begin until March 11. By then, the virus had already been spreading for weeks.\n\nInitial testing done in the US was aimed specifically at individuals coming from China and who had displayed COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nThe earliest cases - those in Washington - were traced back to the original outbreak in Wuhan, China, but subsequent tests of the earliest New York cases revealed viruses with different mutations than the Washington cases, suggesting the viruses were imported from elsewhere.\n\nDaily coronavirus briefing No hype, just the advice and analysis you need Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Though they don't know which specific flight brought the virus from Europe to New York, they believe it took place between late January to early February.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the New York cases studied were European in origin.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Coronavirus", "New York City", "China", "Italy", "NYU", "Mount Sinai", "Americas", "World", "News"], "tags": ["Italy |", "NYU |", "China", "New York City", "coronavirus", "Coronavirus |", "Mount Sinai", "Mount Sinai |", "China |", "NYU", "New York City |"], "authors": ["Graig Graziosi"], "publish_date": "Thu Apr  9 17:10:55 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Researchers have found that most coronavirus cases in New York City originated from Europe, not Asia.
