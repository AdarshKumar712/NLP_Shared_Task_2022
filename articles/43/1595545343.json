The country decided to shut down its last remaining coal plant two years before the scheduled closure, signaling a strong intent to shift to renewable energy.\n\nThe coal plant is located in eastern Stockholm and owned by Stockholm Exergi, a company part-owned by the City of Stockholm. The decision was described by the company as a \u201cmilestone\u201d and will help lower the greenhouse gas emissions of the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis plant has provided the Stockholmers with heat and electricity for a long time \u2014 today we know that we must stop using all fossil fuels, therefore the coal needs to be phased out and we did so several years before the original plan,\u201d Anders Egelrud, chief executive of Stockholm Exergi, said in a statement.\n\nThe company first aimed to close the plant in 2022, gradually reducing its output. But the deadline was met sooner, mainly thanks to a lower electricity demand due to a mild winter in Sweden \u2014 instead of waiting for another two years, better close it now and save the emissions.\n\nThanks to the move, Stockholm, Sweden\u2019s capital, is a step closer to having its district heating produced only by renewable or recycled energy by 2030. Many European cities use district heating instead of localized boilers, as it increases efficiency and reduces pollution.\n\n\u201cSince Stockholm was almost totally fossil-dependent 30-40 years ago, we have made enormous changes and now we are taking the step away from carbon dependence and continuing the journey towards an energy system entirely based on renewable and recycled energy,\u201d Egelrud added.\n\nSweden\u2019s decision advances Europe\u2019s movement away from coal. Belgium became the first EU country to phase out coal for heating and power in 2016. Austria followed this year, closing its last coal-fired plant \u2013 which powered a district heating network in the municipality of Mellach.\n\nSeven more countries are expected to end coal by 2025: France (2022), Slovakia (2023), Portugal (2023), the UK (2024), Ireland (2025) and Italy (2025), according to Europe Beyond Coal. They are expected to be followed by Greece (2028), the Netherlands (2029), Finland (2029), Hungary (2030), and Denmark (2030).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere are ongoing discussions in the Czech Republic, Spain and North Macedonia about when to exit coal-fired electricity. Germany has said it will put its last coal plant offline by 2038, a commitment that still has to be firmed up in the country\u2019s coal exit law.\n\n\u201cAgainst the backdrop of the serious health challenges we are currently facing, leaving coal behind in exchange for renewables is the right decision and will repay us in kind with improved health, climate protection and more resilient economies,\u201d Kathrin Gutmann, campaign director for Europe Beyond Coal, told PV Magazine.\n\nLeaving fossil fuels behind isn\u2019t good just for the planet, it\u2019s also an economically smart move, as the costs of renewables are dropping across the globe. A study by Carbon Tracker showed coal developers could end up losing up to $600 billion as renewable energy is now cheaper than coal energy in many countries.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["sweden", "coal", "Europe"], "authors": ["Fermin Koop Is A Reporter Buenos Aires", "Argentina.
