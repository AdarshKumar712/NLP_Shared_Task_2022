REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Gambling revenue in the Chinese territory of Macau fell 13.7% in December from a year earlier, marking the steepest decline in close to four years.\n\nOverall revenues in 2019 fell 3.4%, hit by tepid demand from high rollers amid the Sino-U.S. trade war and protests in neighboring Hong Kong, figures from the city\u2019s gaming bureau show.\n\nThe year\u2019s revenue decline follows two years of gains in the former Portuguese colony and comes as a closely watched transition of a new government administration is underway.\n\nDecember\u2019s revenue slide was the biggest since a 16.3% drop in March 2016.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping visited Macau for three days in December to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its handover to China.\n\nHis trip, which saw the swearing in of Macau\u2019s new government, was a key reason for December\u2019s muted gambling revenues due to tight security and restrictions on visas which kept many gamblers away.\n\n($1=8.02 patacas)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["US", "MACAU", "REVENUES", "Macau", "Hong Kong", "Asia / Pacific", "China (PRC)", "Emerging Market Countries", "United States"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 07:30:37 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Gambling revenue in the Chinese territory of Macau fell 13.7% in December from a year earlier, marking the steepest decline in close to four years.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/favicon/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "gc07", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;gc07", "description": "Gambling revenue in the Chinese territory of Macau fell 13.7% in December from a year earlier, marking the steepest decline in close to four years.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "US,MACAU,REVENUES,Macau,Hong Kong,Asia / Pacific,China (PRC),Emerging Market Countries,United States", "news_keywords": "US;MACAU;REVENUES;Macau;Hong Kong;Asia / Pacific;China (PRC);Emerging Market Countries;United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Jan 01 07:30:37 UTC 2020", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2020-01-01T07:30:37+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-macau-revenues-idUSKBN1Z01KY", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Macau casino revenue falls in December the most in almost four years", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,MACAU,REVENUES,Macau,Hong Kong,Asia / Pacific,China (PRC),Emerging Market Countries,United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-MACAU-REVENUES", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Macau casino revenue falls in December the most in almost four years", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-01T07:30:37+0000", "sailthru.title": "Macau casino revenue falls in December the most in almost four years", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Macau casino revenue falls in December the most in almost four years", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-macau-revenues-idUSKBN1Z01KY", "type": "article", "description": "Gambling revenue in the Chinese territory of Macau fell 13.7% in December from a...", "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200101&t=2&i=1470801665&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG0019G", "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T07:30:37+0000", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T07:30:37+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "US,MACAU,REVENUES,Macau,Hong Kong,Asia / Pacific,China (PRC),Emerging Market Countries,United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Macau casino revenue falls in December the most in almost four years", "description": "Gambling revenue in the Chinese territory of Macau fell 13.7% in December from a year earlier, marking the steepest decline in close to four years.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200101&t=2&i=1470801665&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG0019G", "src": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200101&t=2&i=1470801665&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG0019G"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
