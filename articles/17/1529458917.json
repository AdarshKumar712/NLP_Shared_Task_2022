Johannesburg - Despite criminal charges laid against a DA councillor for allegedly accepting bribes worth R1.2million, the party has only fined him - drawing allegations that it is soft on corruption. The speaker's office in the City of Ekurhuleni confirmed that it had opened a case against DA councillor Shadow Shabangu after he was found by a council-commissioned forensic investigation to have received R1.2million from Blue Crane Eco Mall. The company built the Springs Mall which opened in March 2017. \u201cIn 2016, although Shabangu disclosed that he had earned R1.2m through consulting services, he did not disclose that these earnings were from a company that was developing a mall within Ekurhuleni and, indeed, within his jurisdiction,\u201d read the forensic report. Shabangu was also embroiled in the alleged sexual harassment of a female DA councillor.\n\nLast week, Sphelele Nxele, spokesperson for council Speaker Patricia Kumalo, said a council meeting held in October had adopted the forensic report and made recommendations thereto, including criminal charges.\n\n\u201cCouncil recommended that the speaker opens a case, which she subsequently opened with the SAPS in Germiston in October.\n\n\u201cThe process is therefore in the hands of law enforcement and council cannot dictate SAPS\u2019s internal processes,\u201d Nxele added.\n\nThe Star sent questions to Shabangu as well as DA Federal Council chairperson Helen Zille.\n\nResponding on their behalf, DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi said the party had acted on the damning allegations against Shabangu.\n\n\u201cAs a party of due process and which respects the rule of law, the party rightfully initiated investigations when both separate allegations were reported.\n\n\u201cWith regards to the first set of allegations (on bribes), the party\u2019s investigation found Mr Shabangu guilty for bringing the party into disrepute and was issued the sanction of a fine,\u201d Malatsi said, without revealing how much the fine was.\n\nOn the sexual harassment allegations, Malatsi said: \u201cThe investigation into the allegations of sexual harassment found that there was insufficient evidence to support the claims. In both instances, the party initiated investigations, did so thoroughly and made reasonable findings based on the evidence available.\n\n\"As a party we take sexual harassment seriously to the extent that up until recently we were the only political party with a sexual harassment policy.\u201d\n\nHowever, a DA insider said Shabangu had a hold over the party because it expelled Joburg councillor Anthony Still for not towing the line in collapsing the city\u2019s agenda and ensuring there was always a quorum to advance service delivery.\n\nStill had repeatedly defied the DA in Joburg by not walking out in order to allegedly disrupt the now ANC-governed City.\n\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019m just disturbed by the fact that the DA is keeping Shabangu in a front-facing position as ward councillor, despite knowing he accepts bribes,\u201d said the insider, who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nThe Star", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Despite criminal charges laid against a DA councillor for allegedly accepting bribes worth R1.2million, the party has only ...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/assets/images/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 293175074032541}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "DA accused of being soft on members embroiled in alleged corrupt dealings | The Star", "description": "Despite criminal charges laid against a DA councillor for allegedly accepting bribes worth R1.2million, the party has only ...", "url": "https://www.iol.co.za/the-star/news/da-accused-of-being-soft-on-members-embroiled-in-alleged-corrupt-dealings-43348561", "image": {"identifier": "https://image.iol.co.za/image/1/process/620x349?source=https://inm-baobab-prod-eu-west-1.s3.amazonaws.com/public/inm/media/image/117066678.JPG&operation=CROP&offset=0x180&resize=3087x1729", "width": 3088, "height": 2056}}, "keywords": "the star, news, DA", "description": "Despite criminal charges laid against a DA councillor for allegedly accepting bribes worth R1.2million, the party has only ...", "msvalidate.01": "5A0910AA1A12E32A5352933CF5FD96E9", "twitter": {"site": "@IOL", "creator": "@IOL", "description": "Despite criminal charges laid against a DA councillor for allegedly accepting bribes worth R1.2million, the party has only ...", "title": "DA accused of being soft on members embroiled in alleged corrupt dealings | The Star", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://image.iol.co.za/image/1/process/620x349?source=https://inm-baobab-prod-eu-west-1.s3.amazonaws.com/public/inm/media/image/117066678.JPG&operation=CROP&offset=0x180&resize=3087x1729"}}, "google-site-verification": "iQCzO2whcLNU6_F3xi1Dck7JMALz7869mBLTQf08wJo", "news_keywords": "the star, news, DA", "msapplication-config": "/assets/images/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "section": "the-star/news"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.iol.co.za/the-star/news/da-accused-of-being-soft-on-members-embroiled-in-alleged-corrupt-dealings-43348561"}
