Fines can now reach $10,000 per call. The law also requires major carriers such as AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile to use a new technology called STIR/SHAKEN to help customers know if they\u2019re being targeted by a robocaller with a spoofed number.\n\n\u201cI applaud Congress for working in a bipartisan manner to combat illegal robocalls and malicious caller ID spoofing,\u201d Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. Pai added he\u2019s glad the agency \u201chas a longer statute of limitations\u201d to pursue scammers.\n\nCarriers have already begun to deploy the STIR/SHAKEN technology in anticipation of the new law, though support is still limited. Eventually, companies like AT&T and Verizon should be able to verify calls between their networks, ensuring a call is coming from a real, authentic number.\n\nTrump\u2019s signing of the TRACED Act into law is just another step in the ongoing battle the FCC has taken to fight robocalls under Pai. The commissioner announced over the summer that the FCC would move to make it illegal to send spoofed calls or texts from overseas. Congress passed new rules in 2018 allowing the commission to do so.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Jan"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "An act targeting illegal robocalls has become law thanks to President Trump signing it this week.
