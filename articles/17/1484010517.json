Here\u2019s a list of great options to get you started.\n\nNCAA\u2019s Final Four\n\nAfter seven short years, the NCAA Men\u2019s Final Four tournament is back in Atlanta for 2020 with the semi-final game on April 4 and the national championship on April 6. Attending a Final Four game can make an epic memory to kick off the decade. But even without a ticket to the big game, the Final Four weekend promises other associated events, such as their Fan Fest and the free Capital One JamFest concert, featuring Taylor Swift. Events will be held at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the Georgia World Congress Center and the State Farm Arena.\n\nApril 3-6. Tickets start at $187. Mercedes-Benz Stadium (for semi-final and final games), 1 AMB Drive NW, Atlanta. 470-341-5000. ncaa.com/final-four.\n\nAtlanta sports\n\nFor that matter, aim to see any sporting event in 2020. Mercedes-Benz Stadium and SunTrust Park, both barely 3 years old, are rather impressive sights for first-time visitors, so that\u2019s reason enough to make the outing. The Gateway Center @ College Park, the newest venue to the Atlanta sports scene, is also worth a gander. The WNBA\u2019s Atlanta Dream will play their 2020 season at the new arena. But overall, it\u2019s also an electrifying experience to soak up the Atlanta sport fandom \u2014 from the Braves to the Hawks and particularly the Atlanta United craze (the 2018 MLS Cup Champions begin their season in late February).\n\nMercedes-Benz Stadium, 1 AMB Drive NW, Atlanta. 470-341-5000, mercedesbenzstadium.com; SunTrust Park, 755 Battery Ave. SE, Atlanta. 404-577-9100, mlb.com/braves; The Gateway Center, 2330 Convention Center Concourse, College Park. arenagatewaycenter.com.\n\nOctober 3, 2019 Atlanta - Atlanta Braves center fielder Ronald Acuna Jr. hits two run home run in 9th inning during Game 1 of best-of-five National League Division Series at SunTrust Park on Thursday, October 3, 2019.

After all, before its short stint as a Shriners temple, the venue started as a movie theater in 1929. So, it\u2019s only fitting you see a reel in honor of the theater\u2019s original function. Check the Fox website for occasional film screenings, such as their Coca-Cola Summer Film Festival.\n\nFox Theatre, 660 Peachtree St. NE, Atlanta. 404 -881-2100, foxtheatre.org.\n\nRegal Atlantic Station 4DX\n\nLooking for a new way to watch movies in 2020? Atlantic Station\u2019s Regal theater can now play select showings in 4DX, an immersive, multisensory viewing experience. Moviegoers will be able to experience effects such as wind and chair vibrations, which synchronize throughout an entire feature-length film. The cinema is currently screening \u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\u201d in 4DX.\n\nRegal Atlantic Station, 261 19th St. NW, Suite 1250, Atlanta. 844-462-7342, regmovies.com.\n\nMORE ON AJC.COM: Best places around Atlanta to keep your New Year\u2019s resolutions\n\nMARTA\u2019s Atlanta Streetcar\n\nHard to believe, but it has been nearly five years since the Atlanta Streetcar began operation. So, if you still haven\u2019t boarded the streetcar, put it in your 2020 plans. The current path operates from Centennial Olympic Park to the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site. And with recently announced expansion plans, the streetcar will soon be on the move to new places, such as the Beltline and Atlanta University Center.\n\nCurrent route starts at Peachtree Center Station and includes 11 stops toward Woodruff Park. 404-848-5000, itsmarta.com.\n\nAJC Peachtree Road Race\n\nThe annual tradition \u2014 now in its 51st year \u2014 draws runners from all over the globe, helping to cement its title as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest 10K.\u201d So why not make this the year to participate in this internationally treasured event? (Note: Registration for the 2020 AJC Peachtree Road Race will open on March 15, 2020). But even if you decide not to run/walk the race, you can still take part in the spectacle by finding a spot along the Peachtree Road course to cheer on the 60,000 participants.\n\nJuly 4. The race starts in Buckhead near Lenox Square Mall and ends in Piedmont Park. 404-231-9064, atlantatrackclub.org/peachtree.\n\nAtlanta Movie Tours\n\nDubbed the \u201cHollywood of the South,\u201d several blockbuster movies and acclaimed television shows are filmed right here in the city. By now, you\u2019ve likely even stumbled across a few filming sets unknowingly. But if all those cryptic yellow filming signs only make you more curious about Atlanta\u2019s movie scene, then perhaps 2020 should be the year you finally checked out a movie tour. Atlanta Movie Tours is a great opportunity to tour the filming locations for movies and shows such as \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cWalking Dead,\u201d \u201cBaby Driver\u201d and more.\n\nAtlanta Movie Tours, 327 Nelson St. SW, Atlanta. 855-255-3456, atlantamovietours.com.\n\nMovie Castings\n\nWant a deeper look behind the lens of Atlanta\u2019s filming scene \u2014 and want to get paid for it, too? If so, be sure to keep an eye out for casting calls in 2020. Follow the social media pages for casting agencies like Central Casting Georgia, which are always on the lookout for extras/background actors (Also, read how to get cast as an extra in Atlanta).\n\nCentral Casting Georgia, 235 Peachtree St. NE, Suite 217, Atlanta; 404- 920-8011, centralcasting.com.\n\nSummerhill Atlanta\n\nThe newly redeveloped mixed-use district will certainly be abuzz in 2020 as more restaurants plan to open in the first quarter, joining an already impressive group of new local restaurant concepts. This year, make plans to visit its retail center, where foodies can find everything from Sicilian-style pizza to Instagrammable doughnuts. And among the most notable 2020 Summerhill openings is Little Bear, the first brick-and-mortar restaurant from acclaimed pop-up chef Jarrett Stieber.\n\nSummerhill Atlanta, Georgia Avenue, summerhillatl.com.\n\nPop-up restaurants and A Mano\n\nSpeaking of pop-ups chefs and restaurants, this growing trend will likely carry on into 2020, so take advantage of all the out-of-the-box culinary fun while you still can. A Mano, an Italian restaurant in the Old Fourth Ward, routinely invites outside chefs to host pop-up dinners in their venue. That\u2019s where you can likely catch pop-up chef Seung Hee Lee, known for her exciting Korean flavor fusions.\n\nA Mano, 587 Ralph McGill Blvd. NE, Atlanta. 404-549-7727, amanoatl.com.\n\nThe Beltline and beyond\n\nEach new year usually brings those same-old resolutions \u2014 one of which is often to get more active. An outdoor walk can be one of the easiest and most rewarding physical activities, and Atlanta has plenty of beautiful options to put foot to pavement, trail or green space. Make this the year to explore everything from hiking trails to the city\u2019s recreational parks. And beginning Jan. 2, 2020, the Beltline (in partnership with the Atlanta Track Club) will host new free weekly group run/walks for their Run.Walk.Go program.\n\nCheck website for run/walk group times and directions to each trail head entrance. beltline.org.\n\nThe sun casts a long shadow as a man jogs along the Atlanta Beltline near the Old Fourth Ward neighborhood.

The Emory Continuing Education center offers a wide selection of courses to help with your goals. Find everything from career-based pursuits, such as learning HTML or email marketing strategy, to personal enrichment interests, such as wine tastings and learning how to paint with acrylics.\n\nEmory Continuing Education, 2635 Century Parkway NE, Suite 300, Atlanta. 404-727-6000. ece.emory.edu .\n\nCentennial Olympic Park and neighboring attractions\n\nIt\u2019s true, sometimes, we locals tend to take things for granted and that means rarely \u2014 or (gasp) never \u2014 taking advantage of our most popular tourist attractions. If this sounds like you, then consider adding Centennial Olympic Park and the surrounding attractions to your 2020 list. Find a concentration of tourist favorites here, including the Georgia Aquarium, the World of Coca-Cola, the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, CNN Studios, the Chick-fil-A College Football Hall of Fame and the SkyView Ferris wheel. (Note: the Atlanta CityPass is a cost-friendly way to see multiple attractions for less).\n\nCentennial Olympic Park, 265 Park Ave. W NW, Atlanta. 404-223-4000. gwcca.org. Visit the attraction websites for venue hours, addresses and pricing.\n\nHigh Museum of Art\n\nIn the same vein, a visit to the High Museum is another activity to mark on your year \u201920 list, especially if you\u2019ve haven\u2019t visited in some time. In addition to its permanent collection and often Instagram-famous temporary exhibits (like their current Virgil Abloh: \u201cFigures of Speech\u201d exhibit), the High also hosts programming such as their jazz and HIGH Frequency nights, where the museum comes alive with music and cocktails.\n\nHigh Museum of Art, 1280 Peachtree St. NE, Atlanta. 404-733-4400. high.org.\n\n\u201cThe Shade\u201d by August Rodin is one of the most notable works on display on the campus at the High Museum of Art. STAFF PHOTO Photo: For the AJC\n\nOakland Cemetery\n\nIt\u2019s more than just a historic graveyard, and if you\u2019ve never been, then perhaps it\u2019s time to discover why. Recognized for its deep history and celebrity grave sites, the popular attraction hosts several tours, including their October Spirit of Oakland Halloween tours, which routinely sell out as early as July. But you don\u2019t have to wait until fall for an ideal time to visit. On Feb. 29, the cemetery hosts its annual Daffodil Day, a free event celebrating the flower\u2019s seasonal return in the cemetery.\n\nOakland Cemetery, 248 Oakland Ave. SE, Atlanta. 404-688-2107, oaklandcemetery.com.\n\nOverview of Oakland Cemetery. Photo: For the AJC\n\nAtlanta Festivals\n\nEach year you tell yourself you\u2019re going to go to \u2026 (insert: Dogwood, Music Midtown, SweetWater 420, AJC Decatur Book Festival, etc.). Don\u2019t let another year go by with missed opportunities and unfulfilled plans. Make 2020 the year to maximize your weekends with some festival fun.\n\nVisit the individual festival websites for festival dates addresses and pricing. dogwood.org, musicmidtown.com, sweetwater420fest.com, decaturbookfestival.com.\n\nLeon Bridges, Walk The Moon, Cold War Kids, and more at Music Midtown Photo: Tad Lemire/ B98.5\n\nStaycation\n\nAs you plan more opportunities to add excitement to your year, also consider planning more opportunities for self-care. And a staycation can be an easy and affordable option for a mental health getaway. You can indulge in a spa-luxury combo at properties like the St. Regis Atlanta and the Waldorf Astoria Buckhead or aim for lively, trendier escapes like the Moxy in midtown and Hotel Clermont.\n\nSt Regis, 88 W. Paces Ferry Road NW, Atlanta. 404-563-7900, stregisatlanta.com; Waldorf Astoria Buckhead, 3376 Peachtree Road NE, Atlanta. 404-995-7500, waatl.com; Moxy Atlanta, 48 13th St. NE, Atlanta. 404-249-9446, acmoxymidtown.com; Hotel Clermont, 789 Ponce de Leon Ave. NE Atlanta. 470-207-5646, hotelclermont.com.\n\nThe Unforgettable Atlanta package at the Waldorf Astoria Atlanta Buckhead is ideal for people with limited time but want the opportunity to relax. Contributed by Waldorf Astoria Atlanta Buckhead Photo: For the AJC\n\n2020 Olympic Trials Marathon\n\nAs the 2020 Tokyo Olympics approach, it\u2019s only natural to reflect on Atlanta\u2019s time as host to the big games. But Atlanta will actually have the chance to relive some of that excitement as the city plays host to the U.S. Olympic marathon trials. The race will take place Feb. 29 (yes, it\u2019s a leap year) and include the nation\u2019s best marathoners. Arranged by the Atlanta Track Club and the USA Track & Field organization, spectators are directed along Peachtree for the best viewing locations of the course.\n\n12:03 p.m. (men\u2019s start time) and 12:13 p.m. (women\u2019s start time) Feb. 29.

NW, Atlanta. atlanta2020trials.com.\n\nSupport local at iVillage @ MLK and more\n\nConsider making a New Year\u2019s resolution to support more local vendors.

Holmes MARTA station, the newly opened shipping container village already hosts a few new businesses with plans to place more tenants soon.\n\niVillage @ MLK, 2489 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, Atlanta. investatlanta.com.\n\nYour polling place\n\nGeorgians will have a packed ballot this election year with two Senate seats, several House seats, the 2020 presidential elections and many local races up for a vote this year.
