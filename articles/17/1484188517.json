Hun Sen's Facebook page\n\nParties say aye to keeping the Consultative Council\n\nMembers of the Supreme Consultation Council have urged the government to keep the body alive in the next mandate as it has been useful in solving people\u2019s problems.\n\nKhmer Rise Party (KRP) president Sok Sovann Vathana Sabung, who is a Council member, said on Tuesday that he supported Prime Minister Hun Sen\u2019s wish to see it continue from the 2023 to 2028 government mandate.\n\nHe said it was an opportunity for parties outside the government to join with it to find solutions for the people.\n\nHe said his Khmer Rise Party had met with many families in the communities, to investigate their problems such as land disputes, inactive local officials, and the disputes between powerful people and ordinary folk.\n\n\u201cI support the statement of Samdech [Hun Sen] because the Supreme Consultation Council is beneficial.\n\n\u201cIn the past, the bad actions of some \u2018naughty\u2019 government officials were hidden or not reported to the government. But Council members have exposed them,\u201d Vathana Sabung said.\n\nAnother Council member, Cambodian Youth Party president Pich Sros, said he too supported its continuation as he wanted to contribute to solving the people\u2019s problems and expose the actions of bad officials.\n\nHe said some had criticised the Council\u2019s creation, but he dismissed the critics as just people with negative opinions.\n\n\u201cWhen Council members find a problem, we submit a report to the government. We then check/review the problem together. Criticisms are the opinions of those who cannot see the good we do,\u201d Sros said.\n\nWhile the Grassroots Democratic Party (GDP) participated in the 2018 national election, it decided not to be a Council member even though it was invited to participate.\n\nGDP spokesman Leok Sothea said on Tuesday that he did not support the Council because it was created as a show and had spent the national budget extravagantly.\n\nSome council members, he said, went to the community and helped solve people\u2019s problems. But these could not be completely resolved if the government and authorities did not strictly enforce the law against those who violated the people\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cBesides this, I don\u2019t see any other use for this council,\u201d Sothea said.\n\nLast Friday, Prime Minister Hun Sen attended the Council\u2019s summit and said he wanted to see it \u2013 currently with 16 member parties \u2013 continue to exist in the next mandate.\n\nHe said the council, although not a parliamentary committee, had provided comments and consultation to the government in an attempt to promote work efficiency, social development and prosperity.\n\nAlthough parliament is not made up of various political parties, the council had contributed a lot to society.\n\n\u201cInvolvement in politics to serve the society does not necessarily mean insulting each other. This applies to small and big parties,\u201d he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Contact Author"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Members of the Supreme Consultation Council have urged the government to keep the body alive in the next mandate as it has been useful in solving people\u2019s problems.
