Many Democrats said Trump improperly urged Zelensky to open investigations into Ukraine\u2019s alleged involvement in the 2016 election, as well as into Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s dealings in the country, withholding military aid as leverage. The president has denied doing anything wrong.\n\n\u201cI've released 21 years of my tax returns, how many has yours? What's he hiding?\" Biden responded.\n\nNo campaign staff or law enforcement removed the hecklers from the event.\n\nEarlier this month, Biden blasted a man at an Iowa town hall as a \"da-- liar\" -- and challenged him to a push-up contest -- after he accused the 77-year-old former vice president of being \"too old\" and took a swipe at son Hunter's role on the board of a controversial Ukrainian natural gas firm.\n\n\"You sent your son over there to get a job and work for a gas company where he had no experience. ... In order to get access for the president... you're selling access to the president just like he was,\u201d the questioner said.\n\nBiden fired back: \"You\u2019re a da-- liar, man. That's not true and no one has ever said that.\"\n\nBIDEN LASHES OUT AT TOWN HALL QUESTIONER\n\nBiden, who would be 78 upon becoming president if he wins, repeatedly has defended his fitness on the campaign trail, noting that with age \"comes wisdom.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe 2020 hopeful was ramping up his campaign efforts ahead of early voting contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, as nobody has emerged as a clear front-runner to win the Democrats' race for the presidential nomination.\n\nFox News' Allie Raffa in Milford, N.H., contributed to this report.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Yael Halon", "Yael Halon Is A Reporter For Fox News."], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was interrupted by hecklers calling him \"creepy\" and a \"pervert\" during a campaign event in Milford, NH, Sunday night.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was interrupted by hecklers calling him \"creepy\" and a \"pervert\" during a campaign event in Milford, NH, Sunday night.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "politics", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Yael Halon", "dc.title": "Hecklers derail Biden New Hampshire campaign event: 'Quid pro Joe'", "dcterms.abstract": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was interrupted by hecklers calling him \"creepy\" and a \"pervert\" during a campaign event in Milford, NH, Sunday night.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was interrupted by hecklers calling him \"creepy\" and a \"pervert\" during a campaign event in Milford, NH, Sunday night.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:e6770d66-451f-5936-bef0-f2e89e9e943b", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2019-12-29", "dcterms.created": "2019-12-29T20:36:18-05:00", "dcterms.modified": "2019-12-29T21:17:43-05:00", "og": {"title": "Hecklers derail Biden New Hampshire campaign event: 'Quid pro Joe'", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was interrupted by hecklers calling him \"creepy\" and a \"pervert\" during a campaign event in Milford, NH, Sunday night.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/JoeBiden720.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hecklers-biden-quid-pro-joe-new-hampshire", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Hecklers derail Biden New Hampshire campaign event: 'Quid pro Joe'", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was interrupted by hecklers calling him \"creepy\" and a \"pervert\" during a campaign event in Milford, NH, Sunday night.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/1024/512/JoeBiden720.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hecklers-biden-quid-pro-joe-new-hampshire"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/PERSON/Joe Biden,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/2020 Presidential Election,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Democrats,/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/NORTHEAST/New Hampshire,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Presidential Primaries,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Presidential,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Campaigning", "classification-isa": "joe-biden,politics,2020-presidential-election,democrats,newhampshire,presprimaries,presidential,campaigning"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hecklers-biden-quid-pro-joe-new-hampshire"}
