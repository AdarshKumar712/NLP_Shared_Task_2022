So, why isn't every prison in Ohio more like it? Ohio is in desperate need of criminal justice reform, considering our track record on incarceration. In 2011, Ohio was the first state to sell a prison to a private company, according to the ACLU of Ohio. The prison population grew rapidly, causing a massive overcrowding issue.\n\nToday, Ohio incarcerates almost five times as many people as the entire United Kingdom and a disproportionate amount of them are black, according to the Prison Policy Initiative. In 2014, The Dispatch reported that 56,000 children in Ohio have an incarcerated parent. Why aren't there skills trainings for these parents too?\n\nWe've invested millions of dollars in prisons and locked up thousands of Ohioans, but researchers agree it has done little to improve our crime rates.\n\nMeghana Kudrimoti, Columbus", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "I was touched by the Sunday Dispatch article \u201cIt takes a village\u201d about a new nursery building at the Ohio Reformatory for Women for incarcerated new mothers who are learning the skills they need to become better parents.
