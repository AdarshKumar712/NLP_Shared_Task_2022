There is quite a lot of scepticism over what are the next steps or whether or not Trump is just trying to get the two parties together. Remember, no one is making money in this particular scenario when you look at Saudi, Russia and particularly when you look at the oil share market in the US that is loose all around. So I would not be surprised if Donald Trump mentions the fact that the supply cuts will help the industry as a whole if in fact they can pull it off.Yes, we will certainly shore up at the time when demand comes back on. What a lot of people are viewing overall is the fact that the demand shocks that we have seen over the last couple of months will pass some stage. The recent manufacturing data out of China suggests they perhaps have been a little bit better. So if we take the goodwill scenario over there, we should get back to a relatively reasonable demand forecast once we get through the concerns that we have over the Covid issues. So in my mind, I am quite optimistic from here that what Donald Trump has said, what Saudi Arabia and Russia should do should create a market where the price of oil would go up from these levels. So in my mind, if I were a consumer, I would probably look to do some hedging.If we get concrete discussions in the emergency meeting of OPEC plus and come together to discuss what the demand picture should look like and discuss cut in supply, then that will undermine any price movements to the downside. So any dip will be well supported given that we have two of the largest producers willing to cut supply. So moving forward, let us see what comes out of the meeting and what is resolved. If there are cuts, which will be widely expected as they were before, then that would shoot up the price for the commodity.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Saudi Arabia", "oil", "Russia", "oil supply cut", "Donald Trump"], "tags": ["SEBI", "Rupee vs Dollar", "oil supply cut", "Russia", "Saudi Arabia", "Donald Trump"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Apr  3 11:23:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Oil demand should pick up once we get over the Covid crisis, said CIO, Probis Securities.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/icons/etfavicon.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "Oil demand should pick up once we get over the Covid crisis, said CIO, Probis Securities.", "news_keywords": "Saudi Arabia,oil,Russia,oil supply cut,Donald Trump", "keywords": "Saudi Arabia,oil,Russia,oil supply cut,Donald Trump", "fb": {"app_id": 128738260476079, "admins": 556964827, "pages": 21540067693}, "og": {"title": "Oil prices will shoot up if Saudi, Russia agree on supply cut: Jonathan Barratt", "site_name": "The Economic Times", "type": "article", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/oil-prices-will-shoot-up-if-saudi-russia-agree-on-supply-cut-jonathan-barratt/articleshow/74961477.cms", "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-74961476,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-167858,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg", "description": "Oil demand should pick up once we get over the Covid crisis, said CIO, Probis Securities."}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-04-03T11:23:00.000Z", "tag": "Donald Trump", "modified_time": "2020-04-03T11:23:00.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "etapp://articleshow/74961477", "app_store_id": 474766725, "app_name": "The Economic Times App"}, "android": {"url": "etandroidapp://articleshow/74961477", "com": "com.et.reader.activities", "app_name": "The Economic Times"}}, "website": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/", "object_type": "website", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@EconomicTimes", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/oil-prices-will-shoot-up-if-saudi-russia-agree-on-supply-cut-jonathan-barratt/articleshow/74961477.cms", "title": "Oil prices will shoot up if Saudi, Russia agree on supply cut: Jonathan Barratt", "description": "Oil demand should pick up once we get over the Covid crisis, said CIO, Probis Securities.", "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-74961476,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-167858,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg", "app": {"country": "IN", "name": {"iphone": "The Economic Times App", "googleplay": "The Economic Times App"}, "id": {"iphone": 474766725, "googleplay": "com.et.reader.activities"}, "url": {"iphone": "etapp://articleshow/74961477", "googleplay": "etandroidapp://articleshow/74961477"}}}}, "canonical_link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/oil-prices-will-shoot-up-if-saudi-russia-agree-on-supply-cut-jonathan-barratt/articleshow/74961477.cms"}
