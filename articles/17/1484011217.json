These include non-durable household items such as packaged food, beverages, toiletries, over-the-counter drugs and other consumables.\n\nThe report highlights that the FMCG goods account for 56% of the total sales by the ecommerce platforms, in terms of volume. However, in terms of value, the FMCG products only make up for 11%, the report highlights. The uneven proportion of value and volume can be attributed to the low cast of these non-durable home essentials.\n\nThe report comes at a time when even the investors both Indian and foreign are not deterred by the said consumer good slowdown. Just last month, Sequoia Capital India and responsAbility invested in $17 Mn in Gurugram-based food and beverage maker Wingreens.\n\nTalking to Inc42, a Sequoia spokesperson said, \u201cFor category creators and challenger brands in large markets, consumer adoption is quite significant if the product positioning and offering is truly differentiated. Such brands tend to be less affected by macro slowdown, especially at the growth stage.\u201d\n\nWingreen cofounder Arjun Srivastava also clarified, \u201cSo far we are not seeing any consumer slowdown because we are in a space where we are continuously innovating. All our products are differentiated from other products in the market. Because of that, we are seeing that there continues to be a lot of interest in consumer uptake.\u201d\n\nThe Fall Of FMCG\n\nA IBEF report also states that the India FMCG sector is booming in India and is poised to become the fourth largest sector in the Indian economy. Another report techsciresearch states that the FMCG market is projected to grow at a 20.6% rate annually to reach an $103.7 Bn in market value by 2020.\n\nHowever, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have lowered India\u2019s growth forecast due to the economic slowdown in the domestic and global markets. IMF estimates that the Indian economy will grow at 7% this year, going down from its earlier prediction of 7.3%. The ADB, too, has predicted a 7% growth rate for India this year.\n\nEven the previous Neilson report had noted that the consumer demand, in terms of value, has decreased to 10 % in the second quarter of FY2020, versus 16.5% in July September 2018. The report also noted that the growth in terms of volume has slashed down to 6.2% from 13.4%.\n\nAccording to the National Statistical Office (NSO) survey of 2017-18, consumer spending has dropped for the first time in four decades.\n\nWhat Else Is The Top Seller For The Ecommerce Platforms?\n\nOn the other hand, the recent Nielsen also notes that mobile phones \u2014 both smartphones and feature phones \u2014 make up for 48% of the total sales on the ecommerce platforms, in terms of value. Smartphone sales are followed by fashion with 16% contribution.\n\nThe report also highlights that a large number of consumers are with holding their purchases in anticipation of the sale period. Ecommerce platforms recorded 84% sales during the Indian festive season sale, and only 15% in the non sale days, the report adds.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Amazon", "Ecommerce", "Acquisitions", "Flipkart", "Ola", "Uber", "Paytm", "Funding"], "authors": ["Kritti B.", "Shanthi S", "Amit R.", "Aman Rawat", "Yatti Soni", "Kopal C.", "Meha A.", "Suprita A.", "Bhumika K.", "Kritti Bhalla"], "publish_date": "Fri Dec 20 08:54:41 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Desipte the economic slowdown affecting the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), a report adds that the FMCG are most sold product on ecommerce", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i0.wp.com/cdn.inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-favicon.png?fit=32%2C32&ssl=1", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "h__t14aH4KCSmW8JRpC9ITgIu-YEINK1VL_LkAdOr_c", "msvalidate.01": "A4C6FEB0E3162AD917341D52087BA093", "p": {"domain_verify": "8e998febb5441e4be3359a745e93c40e"}, "description": "Desipte the economic slowdown affecting the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), a report adds that the FMCG are most sold product on ecommerce", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Consumer Slowdown?
