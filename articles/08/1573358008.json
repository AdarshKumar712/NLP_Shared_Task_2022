The service boasting an extensive library of Disney, Pixar and Marvel content has expanded to more than a dozen countries since its initial November launch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re truly humbled that Disney+ is resonating with millions around the globe, and believe this bodes well for our continued expansion throughout Western Europe and into Japan and all of Latin America later this year,\u201d according to Kevin Mayer, chairman of Disney\u2019s Direct-to-Consumer & International segment.\n\nDisney shares soared following the news. They were up 6.7 percent in premarket trading at $107.81 as of 7:01 a.m. Thursday.\n\nThe Disney+ user base is now equivalent to about 30 percent of the roughly 167 million global paid members Netflix reported at the end of last year. It\u2019s also beating out Disney-controlled Hulu, which launched in 2007 and had 30.7 million paid subscribers as of early February.\n\nDisney+ is a bright spot for the Mouse House amid the coronavirus pandemic. The company has had to close theme parks around the world and delay the release of blockbuster movies such as \u201cMulan\u201d and \u201cBlack Widow\u201d because of the health crisis.\n\nDisney said last week that it would furlough all employees \u201cwhose jobs aren\u2019t necessary at this time\u201d as of April 19. Executive chairman Bob Iger is giving up his salary during the tumultuous period, though it accounts for a small fraction of his total compensation.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Business", "disney", "streaming", "subscriptions"], "tags": ["subscriptions", "streaming", "disney"], "authors": ["April"], "publish_date": "Thu Apr  9 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Disney+ has racked up more than 50 million paid subscribers within five months, an early sign the Mouse House is gaining ground in the streaming wars.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/nypost-2016/static/images/apple-icons/nypost/apple-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
