Perhaps for 2020, you can resolve to help others in your own community.\n\nThe Greenwich Time and the Stamford Advocate are putting a spotlight on some of our neighbors who could use a helping hand this holiday season.\n\nWe are publishing short stories about local people facing real-life difficulties \u2014 and asking our readers to join us in offering assistance through the Giving Fund.\n\nEach case in the Giving Fund includes an estimated dollar amount that would help a local person or family tackle everyday challenges such as rent payments, child care costs and transportation. Every dollar donated to the Giving Fund goes directly to the peoples in the stories, which are published every Thursday and Sunday throughout the holiday season.\n\nYour donation can be small, but it can make a huge difference to some of these families.\n\nThe names of those included have been changed to protect their privacy. The Stamford Advocate and Greenwich Time sponsor The Giving Fund in partnership with Family Centers and Person-to-Person.\n\nReaders are invited to brighten the holidays of others by making a donation. Here are the personal stories of some neighbors in need:\n\nCase #330) Linda is a single mother working hard to raise her daughter, work full time and earn a degree. She has been enrolled in college since 2016 and is on a path to earn a bachelor's degree in human services. Linda has attended classes year round and just completed registration for her last semester. Unfortunately, Linda's last class is not covered by financial aid. A grant of $1,000 will allow her to complete this final class and graduate. This degree will help Linda pursue different job opportunities and improve her career path, ultimately moving her family forward.\n\nCase No. 331) Samantha is a mother of two. During the birth of her second child, she faced complications that kept her from working full time. Her baby was born with a deformity that required extensive physical therapy. She also had to protect herself and her children from an abusive partner who threatened their lives. Samantha has sought the justice system to keep her family safe. The child is now healthy and thriving, however, Samantha is having difficulty covering an outstanding back rent balance from the period when she could not work. A grant of $1,000 will keep Samantha from facing eviction and allow her family to remain in a safe environment.\n\nCase No. 332) After undergoing major surgery during her pregnancy, Mary found herself unable to work for a couple of months. She eventually resumed work and later gave birth. Shortly after, she lost major supports in her life and her work clientele decreased. Though Mary was able to work during that time, it was a stressful period of caring for a baby and her other young children (one of whom has special needs) while recovering from the physical trauma. This winter, Mary is faced with a large bill from her utility company and will not be able to get a delivery until it is cleared. A grant of $1,000 will ensure that Mary and her children have a warm home during the winter.\n\nCase No. 333) Daniel relocated from Puerto Rico about 40 years ago and has been living independently in Norwalk for 12 years. He has worked steadily as an assistant in an appliance repair business. Though he has faced challenges, Daniel has always maintained his employment and his residence. But after battling pain and discomfort for years, he underwent hip replacement surgery this month. As a result, Daniel has not been able to work and for the first time, is at risk of losing his apartment. A grant of $800 will allow Daniel to pay for the full month's rent and remain in his home for the holidays, enabling him to fully recover and return to work.\n\nCase No. 334) Maria is a single mother. Throughout her young adult years, she has battled mental health issues causing her to be anxious, depressed and nervous. Despite this, she has always maintained a job and a place to live, until an immediate family member became ill and died. She had no other option but to work fewer hours, but her employer was no longer accommodating and she was asked to leave. She has since found another job and is grateful that the property owner has not evicted her. She is working alongside her property owner to pay her arrearage. A grant of $1,000 will help Maria maintain housing and allow her to focus on her emotional health and the well-being of her child.\n\nCase No. 335) Julio has always been a hard worker, supporting his wife and three children and sending money back to his parents in Honduras. He never missed work, until this fall he developed pain that was so bad he could not continue. Julio knew something was seriously wrong, but he was afraid what a trip to the hospital might cost. Finally, his wife insisted that he go and Julio heard the diagnosis he had been dreading. After an emergency operation, he was told he has cancer and cannot work for at least three months. A grant of $1,000 will relieve Julio of an immense burden and allow him to focus on getting well while remaining in his home.\n\nCase No. 336) Mr. Martin is an elderly man who has spent a number of years in an abusive relationship. He sought help through a local organization that has assisted him in finding housing where he will be safe from financial, verbal and emotional abuse. Mr. Martin receives a small amount in Social Security benefits that was mostly controlled by his ex-partner, leaving him with few resources. A grant of $650 will help Mr. Martin secure a subsidized apartment, allow him to save and be more self-sufficient in the near future.\n\nCase No. 337) Carol is a hard-working mother of three. When she and her family welcomed their youngest child last year, Carol learned their newborn was inflicted with a cardiac condition and kidney failure that required regular specialized care. Shortly after the child's birth, Carol's husband was laid off and left the family without medical insurance. The medical bills continue to mount, and Carol and her family are in danger of losing their home. A gift of $800 would provide some financial relief and allow Carol to enjoy the holidays with her family\n\nCase No. 338) Jackson is a 28-year-old Latino who was born with chronic health issues and multiple and pervasive learning disabilities. He lives independently in public housing and is working hard as an Uber driver. But his weekly income is not enough to cover special expenses. In order to continue working throughout the winter, he needs to purchase snow tires for his car. A total of $800 in assistance from the Giving Fund would enable him to get new tires and retain his level of self-sufficiency.\n\nCase No. 339) Gloria is a senior in high school and a single mother. She attends school during the day and works at night to make ends meet and provide for her son. Gloria relies on her parents to transport her and her son. She had a goal of purchasing a car, but due to personal reasons, she has been forced to use her savings to continually make ends meet. She is now applying to local colleges to become a physician's assistant. A gift of $500 would allow Gloria to begin to replenish her savings and become one step closer to owning a vehicle. This would allow her to have reliable transportation and make her possibilities endless.\n\nAll cases are also listed online.
