His historian Jean Froissart said the king was \u201cin a gayer mood than he had ever been seen before\u201d.\n\nWhen 40 Spanish ships were spotted, Edward took his sons Edward and John on to his ship and set sail.\n\nSurprising his soldiers, he pointed to a Spanish ship and barked: \u201cSteer this ship to that Spanish one. I want to joust with it.\u201d\n\nThe Spaniards fired arrows and stones at the English, but Edward\u2019s sailors used their grappling irons to pull in the enemy ships and board them.\n\nThe result? Twenty four Spanish boats captured.\n\nBut in 1360, Winchelsea\u2019s darkest hour came.\n\nFrench deputy marshal Jean de Neuville planned a daring raid of the town, massacring its people and taking their barrels of Gascon wine.\n\nNext morning the raiders set fire to the town, putting an end to Winchelsea\u2019s big city hopes.\n\nThis put Rye on high alert.\n\nFor the next two decades, the taxes were raised to build defences while English sailors stayed in the area \u2013 not necessarily a welcome thing for the paranoid townsfolk.\n\nThey had reason to be worried. In 1377, French admiral Jean de Vienne set sail for Rye on the advice of his aide Rainier de Grimaldi.\n\n\u201cIt is from there that the hardy seamen come who have outraged our coasts on so many occasion,\u201d Grimaldi had said.\n\n\u201cThe people of that town do not believe that we could descend on them.\u201d\n\nTwo decades had not been enough to prepare for the French invaders who quickly ransacked Rye, even taking the church\u2019s bronze bells.\n\nWord soon reached the influential Hamo of Offynton in Battle, who led his men through the Weald and set up camp in the ruins of Winchelsea.\n\nFearing a bloody battle, de Vienne first tried to negotiate with Hamo, then attempted to fight his forces.\n\nBoth gambles failed, so the French sailed further west.\n\nSwanning past Beachy Head, de Vienne decided to land at Rottingdean and make his way to poorly defended but rich Lewes.\n\nAs royal historian Jean Froissart described it: \u201cAs they entered Lewes there was a great deal of fighting and many French were wounded by the arrows.\n\n\u201cFinally the French conquered the town and dislodged the English. The whole town of Lewes was ransacked and burnt or destroyed.\u201d\n\nOvingdean Church, Seaford, and even the tiny parish of Exceat were all burnt to the ground before the French made their merry way home.\n\nThough the destruction the Hundred Years\u2019 War caused to Sussex may not seem obvious today, in many ways it was significant in shaping it.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sun Jan 19 09:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "AS THE invaders circled a small village, residents who had not been killed in the fighting fled to the nearby church.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/resources/images/2995245/", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "OMG-Verify-V1": "4389-366acdfc-5224-4c07-bb70-f74d8fbfc2db", "og": {"url": "https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/18168119.lewes-burning-big-invasion-sussex-forgot/", "site_name": "The Argus", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.theargus.co.uk/resources/images/10912539/", "width": 1559, "height": 1343}, "title": "Lewes burning: the big invasion Sussex forgot", "type": "website", "name": "Lewes burning: the big invasion Sussex forgot", "description": "AS THE invaders circled a small village, residents who had not been killed in the fighting fled to the nearby church."}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.theargus.co.uk/resources/images/10912539/"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lewes burning: the big invasion Sussex forgot", "description": "AS THE invaders circled a small village, residents who had not been killed in the fighting fled to the nearby church."}, "fb": {"app_id": 166200340097090, "pages": 104390656582501}, "medium": "news", "title": "Lewes burning: the big invasion Sussex forgot", "description": "AS THE invaders circled a small village, residents who had not been killed in the fighting fled to the nearby church."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/18168119.lewes-burning-big-invasion-sussex-forgot/"}
