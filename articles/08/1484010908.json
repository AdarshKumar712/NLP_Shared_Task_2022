In Nevada, it\u2019s 6.75 percent.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["- Hugh Jackson", "- Robin Bravender", "- Michael Lyle", "- Jeniffer Solis"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Current-Icon-150x150.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/macau-venetian.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/macau-venetian.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 576}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "While Hong Kong protests for more independence, China smiles on Macau | Nevada Current", "description": "In December while commemorating the 20th anniversary of Portugal handing over Macau to China, President Xi Jinping drew sharp contrasts between Macau and China\u2019s other Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong. \u201cXi praised the gambling hub for being one of the safest cities in the world, where people \u2018rationally\u2019 express different views,\u201d Reuters reported.
