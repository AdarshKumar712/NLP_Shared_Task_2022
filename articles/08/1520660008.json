In retrospect, it\u2019s astounding what Harry and his fellow pioneers accomplished in just over three decades \u2014 B.C. wines are securely on the global map.\u201d\n\nIn honour of McWatters, Chefs\u2019 Table is launching a new scholarship through the Okanagan College Foundation with an initial contribution of $2,000 per annum for a minimum period of five years. Students who are enrolled in a wine or tourism program at Okanagan College and participating in an international education experience will be eligible for the scholarship.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve donated first, but it\u2019s really a call to action: We invite industry associations, wineries and private individuals to enhance our gift by donating online or contacting the Okanagan College Foundation and pledging their support,\u201d said Belcham.\n\nMcWatters is a legend in the world of the British Columbia wine industry. He was perhaps best known as the founder of Sumac Estate Winery and as the director of the British Columbia Wine Institute. McWatters is remembered in the industry as a leader in developing quality standards for wine growing, wine making, and wine marketing.\n\nREAD MORE: Prestigious award renamed for late wine industry pioneer Harry McWatters\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s mentorship is rightly legendary,\u201d said Jonathan Rouse, associate dean of the Okanagan School of Business and director of food, wine and tourism at Okanagan College.\n\n\u201cHe always had his eye on emerging talent in the business, and vigorously mentored young people, through his roles as founder of the BC Wine Institute and his many ongoing industry affiliations.\u201d\n\nMcWatters taught at the college and was bestowed an honorary doctorate for his vast contributions in the B.C. wine community.\n\nWcWatters\u2019 wife Lisa Lalonde and his family will also be contributing to the scholarship.\n\n\u201cHarry collected experiences. He loved nothing more than planning trips based on where we would dine, what we would drink and who we would visit. We think Harry would love the creative use of these funds, and our family is pleased to add to the initial contribution in the amount of $1,000 per annum,\u201d said Lalonde.\n\nREAD MORE: Oliver to be future home of Canada\u2019s first District Wine Village\n\nTo report a typo, email: editor@pentictonwesternnews.com.\n\nwine", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["BCHL", "Celebrations of Life", "wine", "Salmon Arm Silverbacks"], "authors": ["Jesse Day"], "publish_date": "Thu Feb 13 17:30:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "McWatters\u2019 passing left \u201cmassive void\u201d in the B.C. wine industry.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://2yw6hl18xgcx2ovds7nmmeug-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/BlackPress/assets/images/icons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "gpsid": 20558107, "generator": "AMP for WP 0.9.98.2", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Salmon Arm Observer", "url": "https://www.saobserver.net/news/new-scholarship-to-honour-canadian-wine-icon-harry-mcwatters/", "title": "New scholarship to honour Canadian wine icon Harry McWatters - Salmon Arm Observer", "description": "McWatters\u2019 passing left \u201cmassive void\u201d in the B.C. wine industry.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.saobserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/20558107_web1_200219-PWN-McWattersScholarship-wine_1-1024x684.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 684}, "secure_url": "https://www.saobserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/20558107_web1_200219-PWN-McWattersScholarship-wine_1-1024x684.jpg"}, "description": "McWatters\u2019 passing left \u201cmassive void\u201d in the B.C. wine industry.", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2020-02-13T17:30:00-08:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New scholarship to honour Canadian wine icon Harry McWatters - Salmon Arm Observer", "description": "McWatters\u2019 passing left \u201cmassive void\u201d in the B.C. wine industry.", "image": "https://www.saobserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/20558107_web1_200219-PWN-McWattersScholarship-wine_1-1024x684.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 295882870429966}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.saobserver.net/news/new-scholarship-to-honour-canadian-wine-icon-harry-mcwatters/"}
