When officers arrived on the scene, the suspect, Juan Gabriel Miranda, fled in his car.\n\nSeveral minutes later, Miranda returned to the area and officers gave orders for him to stop and exit his vehicle, police said. A gunshot was heard as the man fled in the direction of the officers, \u201cat which time an officer involved shooting occurred.\u201d\n\nWhen Miranda, 46, drove back into the area moments later, a second officer-involved shooting occurred. The suspect stopped the car \u201cand a short stand-off with the suspect ensued,\u201d police said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficers used beanbag rounds and were able to detain the suspect \u2014 who was not struck by gunfire \u2014 without further incident. No officers were struck by gunfire, but one of them sustained a minor injury.\n\nMiranda was transported to a hospital and will be booked on felony charges stemming from the domestic violence incident, in addition to assault charges on the officers.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Things to Do"], "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Brittny Mejia Is A Reporter On The Los Angeles Times", "Metro Desk Covering Breaking News", "Stories On Immigration", "Race.
