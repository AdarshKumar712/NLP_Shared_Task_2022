Two actually had a lot of kayaking experience and the other two didn\u2019t have any,\" Lamb said.\n\nAt some point all four men entered the water.\n\nOne paddled to safety and called for help.\n\nA second male was out of the water by the time first responders arrived.\n\nThe third was rescued from the water by first responders.\n\nAll three were in stable condition.\n\nEmergency crews spent the morning searching for the fourth kayaker.\n\n\u201cThe last known location for the fourth victim was up here near the dam area. So we investigated, there\u2019s a cable system up there and a large log and we were able to shake the log free and recover the fourth victim,\u201d Lamb said.\n\nThe fourth man was found and transported to the hospital. He was pronounced deceased a short time after being taken to the hospital, according to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe would like to make sure that people know that they shouldn\u2019t be going into the river unless they really know what they\u2019re doing, especially above a dam,\u201d Lamb said.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\nemail", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Melissa Hudson"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "og": {"title": "Missing kayaker pulled from St. Joseph River in Niles has died", "description": "The man who was pulled from the St. Joseph River in Niles around noon on Wednesday has died, according to law enforcement.", "type": "website", "url": "https://www.abc57.com/news/crews-searching-for-missing-kayaker-in-niles", "image": {"identifier": "https://newscdn.weigelbroadcasting.com/LGbmx-1577898607-154385-blog-searchforkayaker.jpg", "width": 880, "height": 495}, "site_name": "ABC57"}, "fb": {"admins": 567665230, "app_id": 1571125042932041, "pages": "100510823358664,119162531570115,452172825176170"}, "Description": "ABC57 News in South Bend, Ind. covers all of Michiana including St. Joseph, Elkhart, Kosciusko, LaPorte and Marshall counties in Indiana and Berrien, Cass, Van Buren and St. Joseph counties in Mich.", "KEYWORDS": "Michiana, South Bend News, Mishawaka News, Berrien County News, Dowagiac News, La Porte News, La Grange News, Warsaw News, Plymouth News, Sturgis News, Buchanan News, Niles News, Elkhart News, Goshen News, ABC 57, ABC 57 Weather, Michiana Weather, Notre Dame Sports, South Bend Cubs, Notre Dame News.", "news_keywords": "Michiana, South Bend News, Mishawaka News, Berrien County News, Dowagiac News, La Porte News, La Grange News, Warsaw News, Plymouth News, Sturgis News, Buchanan News, Niles News, Elkhart News, Goshen News, ABC 57, ABC 57 Weather, Michiana Weather, Notre Dame Sports, South Bend Cubs, Notre Dame News.", "owner": "WBND", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Missing kayaker pulled from St. Joseph River in Niles has died", "description": "The man who was pulled from the St. Joseph River in Niles around noon on Wednesday has died, according to law enforcement."}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.abc57.com/news/crews-searching-for-missing-kayaker-in-niles"}
