It has essentially driven up the cost of recycling. It put the imperative on a cleaner recycling stream. The cleaner the material going into the recycling facilities, the less costly it is for them to process it.\u201d\n\nAccording to a release, residents will be informed via the fliers on what can be recycled and what should be placed in the general trash; the fliers also include information on what is acceptable recyclables and how to prepare them.\n\nThe program does not involve inspecting recycling bin content and no analysis or inspections of bins is being done.\n\nGeiger said that the campaign is an effort to help educate residents on the inner workings and often unknown elements of recycling, especially after the township signed a new contract for trash services with Waste Management that included a possible financial penalty for a too-high recycled content contamination rate.\n\nThe contamination of recyclable material is often not understood by the wider public. Under the new contract, the township will face a financial penalty of the recycling contamination rate exceeds 25 percent. During a Dec. 4 presentation, officials said the township has been average about a 22 to 23 percent contamination rate over the past several years, below the threshold.\n\nRelated: Woodlands to seek options for trash services after learning of proposed rate hike from Waste Management\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen municipalities across the nation hit hard by all of this. Some have closed their recycling programs, some have scaled them down. We are fortunate here that our program is strong and will continue to be, we don\u2019t see any looming impacts,\u201d Geiger said. \u201cWe want to do our part to keep it strong by cleaning up our recycling.\u201d\n\nWhat is described as \u201ccontaminated\u201d recyclables cannot be recycled, and are instead placed into a landfill. Products like a red Solo cup cannot be recycled because it is not the correct type of plastic. Other contaminations include greasy pizza boxes, styrofoam, plastic bags, wiring and even coat hangers.\n\nCardboard materials need to be clean, and plastic bottles should be washed out quickly with water. Chunks of food are contaminants, too, and should be removed from any item a resident tries to recycle.\n\nA full list of what is acceptable and is not is available online at The Woodlands Township website. Among the items that can be recycled are: aluminum, steel or tin cans; cartons that hold milk, juice or other items like soup; cardboard and other paperboard products; and plastic containers with the icon indicating it is plastic type one through five.\n\n\u201cFor decades, it was about encouraging people to recycle. well, The Woodlands\u2026we have that message. We have over 90 percent participation in our curbside recycling program, that is fantastic, that is sky high, well above the national average,\u201d he added. \u201cThe focus now is not just to do recycling, it is doing it correctly. The \u2018Recycle Right\u2019 program is all about telling residents to only put the items in the recycle cart that are supposed (to be in there).\u201d\n\njeff.forward@chron.com", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jeff Forward", "Staff Writer"], "publish_date": "Wed Feb 12 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "ispremium": 0, "dc.date": "2020-02-12T06:00:00Z", "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-12T06:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2020-02-13T14:42:26Z", "opinion": "false"}, "SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "news_keywords": "John Geiger, The Woodlands, The Woodlands Township, China, Woodlands News, Recycle Right, jeff.forward@chron.com", "nlpOrganization": "China, Woodlands News", "nlpPerson": "John Geiger", "nlpLocation": "The Woodlands, The Woodlands Township", "nlpOther": "Recycle Right, jeff.forward@chron.com", "nlpCategories": "%2FBusiness+%26+Industrial%2FEnergy+%26+Utilities", "sailthru.title": "Woodlands program teaches proper recycling habits as industry changes", "sailthru.date": "2020-02-12 0:00:00 -0600", "sailthru.author": "By Jeff Forward, Staff writer", "sailthru_type": "article", "sailthru_uid": 15053270, "sailthru_section": "the-woodlands-villager,the-woodlands-news", "sailthru_subject": "woodlands-news", "sailthru_pubname": "houston-chronicle", "sailthru_siteid": 21, "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/10/45/15/19026809/3/sailthruImage.jpg", "og": {"title": "Fresh off a new contract with Waste Management, Woodlands starts new program to teach proper recycling habits", "description": "Officials in The Woodlands have announced a new campaign called \"Recycle Right,\" which is aimed at teaching residents the proper ins and outs of recycling.
