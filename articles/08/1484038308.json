Police said the man, identified as Steven Fernandez of San Diego, fled on foot while firing several shots at the officer, taking cover in a garage in the 200 block of Knox Place where police said he then shot at a resident.\n\nFernandez was confined to the garage, and a SWAT team was called in an attempt to negotiate with Fernandez.\n\nAs negotiations took place, police said Fernandez displayed a gun and was subsequently shot and injured by an officer.\n\nFernandez was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a police officer and was taken to the hospital for treatment. He is expected to survive.\n\nPolice said two handguns were recovered at the scene.\n\nNo officers or civilians were injured in the shootings.\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2019 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
