The total value of liquor sales in Telangana on December 31 night was around Rs 350 crore, market experts said.Across the state, 1,91,323 cases of beer and 2,11,515 cases of Indian-made foreign liquor were sold on Tuesday night alone. \u201cWith Hyderabad alone catering to 60% of the sales, Rs 210 crore worth beer and other liquor brands were lapped up by the guzzlers in the city,\u201d a trader explained.Curiously, the total sales value remained the same when compared to the last year despite the increase in the prices recently. On December 31, 2018, 2,18,007 cases of beer and 2,00,051 cases of IMFL were sold across the state. \u201cThere was a slight dip in the number of cases sold when compared to the last year. But, increase in the prices made up for the total sale value remaining intact,\u201d sources in the liquor trade averred.Meanwhile, some liquor shops, in their bid to woo tipplers, came up with innovative ideas to increase sales on December 31 night.

The first prize winner would get an LCD TV, second prize winner a smart phone and third prize winner would get silver coins.Many liquor lovers fell for the bait and stood in a long queue to buy liquor.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Hyderabad news", "Hyderabad latest news", "Hyderabad news live", "Hyderabad news today", "Today news Hyderabad", "Telangana", "new year", "Liquor consumption", "Hyderabad swings in Rs 210 crore liquor", "Hyderabad news"], "tags": ["GHMC", "Hyderabad Metro", "New Year", "Telangana", "Asaduddin owaisi", "K Chandrasekhar Rao", "KT Rama Rao"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Liquor literally flowed in Hyderabad as tipplers spent a whopping Rs 210 crore on various brands as they bade goodbye to 2019 on Tuesday night and ush", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Liquor literally flowed in Hyderabad as tipplers spent a whopping Rs 210 crore on various brands as they bade goodbye to 2019 on Tuesday night and ush", "keywords": "Hyderabad news, Hyderabad latest news, Hyderabad news live, Hyderabad news today, Today news Hyderabad,Telangana,new year,Liquor consumption,Hyderabad swings in Rs 210 crore liquor,Hyderabad news", "robots": "NOODP", "og": {"title": "New Year celebrations: Hyderabad swings in Rs 210 crore liquor | Hyderabad News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/new-year-revelry-hyd-drowns-in-rs-210cr-liquor/articleshow/73062516.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063390,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-128081,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "Liquor literally flowed in Hyderabad as tipplers spent a whopping Rs 210 crore on various brands as they bade goodbye to 2019 on Tuesday night and ush", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/new-year-revelry-hyd-drowns-in-rs-210cr-liquor/articleshow/73062516.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063390,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-128081,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "New Year celebrations: Hyderabad swings in Rs 210 crore liquor | Hyderabad News - Times of India", "description": "Liquor literally flowed in Hyderabad as tipplers spent a whopping Rs 210 crore on various brands as they bade goodbye to 2019 on Tuesday night and ush", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "news_keywords": "Telangana,new year,Liquor consumption,Hyderabad swings in Rs 210 crore liquor,Hyderabad news", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/new-year-revelry-hyd-drowns-in-rs-210cr-liquor/articleshow/73062516.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 227797153941209, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/new-year-revelry-hyd-drowns-in-rs-210cr-liquor/articleshow/73062516.cms"}
