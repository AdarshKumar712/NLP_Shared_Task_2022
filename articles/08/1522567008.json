(WKRG) \u2014 A UFC fighter from McIntosh gets his first win with the premier mixed martial arts promotion, but maybe not in the way he would have wanted. According to MMA Fighting.com, Brok Weaver was declared the winner of his bout with Rodrigo Vargas after Weaver was knocked out by a \u201cblatantly illegal knee\u201d late in the first round Saturday night.\n\nWeaver landed his UFC contract after winning in Dana White\u2019s Contender Series in 2019. Weaver had a hero\u2019s welcome with a parade last year after landing the contract. A post from Port City MMA says Weaver is eager to get back into the gym to train for his next fight.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Chris Best", "The Associated Press", "Nicolette Schleisman"], "publish_date": "Sun Feb 16 13:36:27 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.wkrg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2019/06/thumbnail_WKRG_5_300PX.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "07e_JC57dQ2iJscG402lpVfZSJAuAxVAk3ZQn_FiexY", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=560952787", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "fb": {"pages": 275851267499}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Local UFC fighter gets first UFC win in unusual fashion", "url": "https://www.wkrg.com/state-regional/local-ufc-fighter-gets-first-ufc-win-in-unusual-fashion/", "description": "Brok Weaver was declared the winner of his bout after being knocked out by an illegal knee", "site_name": "WKRG News 5", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.wkrg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2019/08/brok-weaver.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "secure_url": "https://www.wkrg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2019/08/brok-weaver.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-16T13:36:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-16T18:47:10+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Local UFC fighter gets first UFC win in unusual fashion"}, "image": "https://www.wkrg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2019/08/brok-weaver.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Local UFC fighter gets first UFC win in unusual fashion", "description": "Brok Weaver was declared the winner of his bout after being knocked out by an illegal knee"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.wkrg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2019/06/thumbnail_WKRG_5_300PX.png?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.wkrg.com/state-regional/local-ufc-fighter-gets-first-ufc-win-in-unusual-fashion/"}
