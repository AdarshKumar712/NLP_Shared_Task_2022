The store just celebrated it\u2019s fifth anniversary of operation.\n\nEat Pure Mountain Market just celebrated its fifth anniversary of opening its doors to the people of Golden in December 2014.\n\nSupplying nourishing and organic locally sourced foods to the people of Golden, owner Nicole Du Vent has been enjoying the ride so far.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so lucky and blessed to have a business that\u2019s working in this community, and I\u2019m thankful for the support that the community has shown since the start,\u201d said Du Vent. \u201cI grew up on an orchard and I worked as a chef for almost 20 years, so food has always been my passion.\u201d\n\nDu Vent formerly worked as a chef in the backcountry, preparing meals for people who are on the go and living a healthy active lifestyle. While it was work she greatly enjoyed, she wanted to have a bigger role in the community of Golden, rather than continue to come and go in town due to her job.\n\n\u201cWhen I first opened my business, people would come in and be like \u2018oh, you must be new!\u2019, and I had to tell them that I had been in Golden for eight years,\u201d said Du Vent. \u201cGetting to know the community and seeing the same faces and chatting with them, being a part of this community has been so fulfilling.\u201d\n\nOne of the services that Eat Pure Mountain Market provides Golden is their produce bins. The bins, which are offered in a range of sizes and are comprised of 75 per cent vegetables and 25 per cent fruit, offer the most value per dollar for the produce that clients receive.\n\nWith prices varying from $30-45, bins are assembled by the staff at Eat Pure and are picked up by clients on Thursdays. The bins provide them with a wide assortment of foods for the week.\n\n\u201cWe shop the price list for the best deals, so you\u2019re going to get the most value for your organic dollar,\u201d said Du Vent. \u201cIt ensures that you get the most value, versus coming in and not knowing what the deals are.\u201d\n\nAll the produce is locally sourced, which is an important aspect of Eat Pure\u2019s mantra. Not only do locally sourced foods help protect the environment, according to Du Vent, but it also supports the local economy and creates opportunities for local produce suppliers to maintain a viable business.\n\n\u201cThere was one business in town that said she didn\u2019t think she could have kept up her business until we opened,\u201d said Du Vent. \u201cHaving a year round outlet can be the difference between someone having their dream business or not, so it\u2019s important to support local.\u201d\n\nIn the new year, Eat Pure will be providing a series of talks and classes on organic and healthy eating, as well as their customer appreciation day on Saturday, January 5.
