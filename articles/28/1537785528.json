The DHS chief\u2019s directive indicates he is prepared to take aim against the state laws.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, I am instructing each operational component to conduct an assessment of the impact of these laws, so that the Department is prepared to deal with and counter these impacts as we protect the homeland,\u201d Wolf\u2019s memo read.\n\nThe memo follows implementation of New York\u2019s \u201cGreen Light\u201d law, and passage of a similar bill in New Jersey in December. Both laws not only allow illegal aliens to obtain driver\u2019s licenses, but also restrict DMV data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Steven Ahle", "Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 10:30:26 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://davidharrisjr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/favicon2.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Homeland Security Chief Orders Review Of State Laws Allowing Driver\u2019s Licenses For Illegal Aliens", "description": "Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ordered a review of state laws allowing illegal aliens to obtain driver's licenses that will enable many illegals to vote.\r\n\r\nNew York is the latest state to pass such a bill on driver's licenses.\r\n\r\nMany county clerks in", "image": {"identifier": "https://davidharrisjr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cw.jpg", "url": "https://davidharrisjr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cw.jpg", "secure_url": "https://davidharrisjr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cw.jpg", "width": 992, "height": 744}, "url": "https://davidharrisjr.com/steven/hsc-orders-review-of-state-laws-allowing-drivers-licenses-for-illegals/", "site_name": "David Harris Jr", "updated_time": "2020-01-06T13:09:08-08:00", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T10:30:26-08:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-06T13:09:08-08:00", "section": "Politics", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DavidJHarrisJr/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Homeland Security Chief Orders Review Of State Laws Allowing Driver\u2019s Licenses For Illegal Aliens", "description": "Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ordered a review of state laws allowing illegal aliens to obtain driver's licenses that will enable many illegals to vote.\r\n\r\nNew York is the latest state to pass such a bill on driver's licenses.\r\n\r\nMany county clerks in", "image": "https://davidharrisjr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cw.jpg", "url": "https://davidharrisjr.com/steven/hsc-orders-review-of-state-laws-allowing-drivers-licenses-for-illegals/", "site": "@@DavidJHarrisJr"}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1"}, "canonical_link": "https://davidharrisjr.com/steven/hsc-orders-review-of-state-laws-allowing-drivers-licenses-for-illegals/"}
