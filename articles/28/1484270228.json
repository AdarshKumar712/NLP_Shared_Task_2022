His name was Dalvin Pacley.\n\n\u201cEveryday you wake up and you go through it again when you realize they are not there,\u201d said Melissa Facchiano, Dalvin Pacley\u2019s Grandmother.\n\nThe owner of the daycare Elaine Harris and her two sons survived the fire, but lost their home.\n\nIn October, investigators determined the fire was caused by an electrical failure associated with a routinely used extension cord.\n\nFire investigators also revealed there was only one smoke detector inside the entire daycare, which caused some outrage in the community.\n\n\u201cThey said they only found one smoke detector, which I mean if they heard the smoke detector everyone would\u2019ve been out of the house and my kids would still be here today,\u201d said Luther Jones, father of four children.\n\nIn September, changes were made to the way state certified daycare facilities are inspected.\n\nPennsylvania Department of Human Services Secretary Teresa Miller said the current inspection guidelines were outdated and did not check for smoke detectors.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it took a tragedy like this for us to see that, but that\u2019s why we\u2019re here and we looked at that and said more can be done,\u201d said Teresa Miller, Secretary, Pennsylvania Department of Human Services.\n\nIn November, Erie City Council unanimously voted to pass an ordinance requiring child care facilities to obtain an annual child care facility certificate of occupancy.\n\n\u201cSometimes you gotta ruffle some feathers, but if you want change you have to be aggressive,\u201d said Chief Guy Santone, Erie Fire Department.\n\nErie Fire Chief Guy Santone says more than 40 daycare centers in the city have received a letter explaining the inspection process.\n\nAfter this tragedy, multiple businesses throughout the Erie region raised thousands of dollars to help the families affected by the fire.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Fire", "Harris Family Daycare", "year in review"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Tiarra Braddock", "Chelsey Withers"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 00:57:10 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The tragic story that shook the entire community and the entire nation in 2019 was the Harris Family Daycare fire that killed five children.
