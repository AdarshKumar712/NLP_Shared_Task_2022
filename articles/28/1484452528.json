The presence of Allah is needed in running any administration. Everything starts and ends with God. The Governor has demonstrated that we must put God first in everything we do in our lives.\n\n\u201cThe Governor was at the Mosque and he charged us to live in harmony, respect the rule of law and do what is needful at all times. Prayers were said for all residents of Lagos. Prayers were recited to God to guide the Governor and members of his Exco as they lead the State.\u201d\n\nAhmed disclosed that the State government is working on several programmes that will speak to the THEMES agenda of the current administration, noting that the Government intends to boost the religious tolerance among Lagosians.\n\nDuring the session that was tagged: \u2018Prayer For The First Family, Lagos State\u2019s clerics committed the Governor; the Deputy Governor, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat; Members of State Executive Council; the Judiciary; members of the House of Assembly and Lagos State in God\u2019s hands.\n\nIn his remark, S.A Religious Matters (Christian), Very Reverend Bukola Adeleke, said they are working with the Commissioner for Home Affairs, Pharm (Mrs) Uzamat Akinbile-Yusuf, to ensure Lagosians respects other\u2019s religious views.\n\n\u201cWe are here today to pray for the first family in Lagos and of course, to commit the State into the hands of God. The Bible tells us that we must lay everything in God\u2019s hands, which is why we are here for the sole purpose of praying for Lagos. We prayed for Mr. Governor and committed his activities and plans for Lagos State into God\u2019s hands. We believe that God Almighty has answered our prayers.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of plans for religious tolerance in Lagos. We are working with Hon. Akinbile-Yusuf to ensure that Lagosians tolerate and respect the religious views of others. We want the peace we have been enjoying in Lagos to continue and the way to achieve that is to continuously respect other\u2019s religion,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this:\n\n<!\u2013\n\nafter_article responsive (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\u2013>", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 04:41:04 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://nigeriadailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/cropped-NDN-FB-logo-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "2020: Lagos clerics hold prayers for Sanwo-Olu - NigeriaDailyNews", "description": "<!\u2013 Sanwo-Olu \u2013> Sanwo-Olu A large gathering of Muslim and Christian Clerics, Wednesday, came together to pray for the First Family and Lagos State as a whole.
