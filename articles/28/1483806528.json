The officials are required to use a certain amount of Zero Pay points, given as employee benefits.By Kim Young-won ( wone0102@heraldcorp.com", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["The Korea Herald", "Korean news", "koreaHerald", "South Korea  news", "South Korea  news in english", "Asia News", "K-POP", "KPOP", "\ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\ud5e4\ub7f4\ub4dc", "\ub354\ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\ud5e4\ub7f4\ub4dc", "\ucf54\ub9ac\uc544 \ud5e4\ub7f4\ub4dc"], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Korea Herald"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 15:29:09 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "After\u00a0its launch in Dec. 2018,\u00a0Seoul City\u2019s own mobile payment app Zero Pay is now in a very fragile situation and is struggling to make a mark in the local payment industry, data showed on Wednesday.
