Gavin Newsom ordered all California state parks closed to vehicle access because of continued violations of the social-distancing rules put in place to slow the coronavirus spread. Read the details here.\n\nOn Thursday, California added 59 more state parks to the list of state parks where vehicle access is closed to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. Altogether, there are now 98 state parks and beaches with closed parking, located in 23 of California\u2019s 58 counties.\n\nAlthough their parking lots are closed to vehicles, most remain open to people who walk in.\n\nThe expanded list includes some prominent parks in the greater Bay Area, including Mount Diablo in Contra Costa County, Castle Rock on the Santa Clara-Santa Cruz county line, and multiple state beaches in Santa Cruz County and Monterey County, including New Brighton, Natural Bridges, Andrew Molera, Point Lobos and Pfeiffer Big Sur.\n\n\u201cLast weekend, many state parks and beaches received record visitation numbers, which made it impossible for the public to implement appropriate social and physical distancing practices,\u201d said state parks spokeswoman Gloria Sandoval in a statement. \u201cAs a result, State Parks is working closely with local county and public health officials and assessing park operations on a daily basis to provide access to healthy outdoor options while maintaining required social and physical distancing.\u201d\n\nThe list of parks where parking lots are closed as of Thursday March 26:\n\nCalaveras County:\n\nCalaveras Big Trees State Park (SP)\n\nContra Costa County:\n\nMount Diablo SP\n\nEl Dorado County:\n\nEd Z\u2019berg Sugar Pine Point SP\n\nEmerald Bay SP\n\nFolsom Lake State Recreation Area (SRA)\n\nMarshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park (SHP)\n\nLos Angeles County:\n\nBaldwin Hills Scenic Overlook\n\nEl Matador State Beach (SB)\n\nLeo Carrillo State Park SP\n\nLos Angeles SHP\n\nMalibu Creek SP\n\nMalibu Lagoon SB\n\nMalibu Pier and parking area were closed on 3/24/2020 to vehicular traffic and pier closed to pedestrian traffic at the western most point of concession restaurant.
