In a note on their official website, the brand confirmed that this feature of content recommendation will be available on phones with ColorOS 6 and above. This will basically promote apps and commercial links in the base operating system through the phone\u2019s Phone Manager app and Security Check page.\n\n\u201cTo continue offering more surprises for you and maintain a healthy and sustainable business model, we have introduced commercial content recommendation in the OS. Realme phones with ColorOS 6 and above will receive such recommendation updates. We encourage you to update the system regularly to enjoy a better operating experience and receive the latest Android security patches,\u201d the phone maker said in its note.\n\nEven though the brand has stated that ads will appear in the Phone Manager and on the Security Check page once new apps are installed, they have also mentioned that the users who do not want this ad service can disable the same.
