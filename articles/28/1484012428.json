As you would have seen\u2026 over 40 businesses have been fined since the ban was implemented on plastic bags. We expect that a similar level of vigilance will take place from the National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA) and the varying agencies,\u201d he said.\n\nOn January 1, 2019, a ban was placed on specific categories of single-use plastic products.\n\nThe overall ban relates to the importation, manufacture and use of plastic bags of dimensions 24\u201dx24\u201d and thickness of 1.2 mil or less; the importation, manufacture and use of plastic drinking straws, except those attached to juice boxes and tetrapaks, as well as straws utilised by the medical sector and the disabled community; and the importation of expanded polystyrene foam (commonly called styrofoam) that are used in the food and beverage industry.\n\nTwo ministerial orders were signed under the Trade Act and the Natural Resources and Conservation Authority (NRCA) Act to reinforce the ban.\n\nThe maximum fine under the Trade Act (Trade Plastic Packing Material Order) 2018 is $2 million, while under the NRCA (Plastic Packaging Prohibiting) Order 2018, the fine is $50,000. Both Orders carry a term of imprisonment of two years.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Loop News"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "As of January 1, 2020, the Government will impose a ban on the local manufacture, distribution and use of expanded polystyrene foam products used in the food and beverage", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/core/misc/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 751802658312414}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "As of January 1, 2020, the Government will impose a ban on the local manufacture, distribution and use of expanded polystyrene foam products used in the food and beverage", "og": {"url": "http://www.loopjamaica.com/content/styrofoam-ban-take-effect-january-1", "title": "Styrofoam ban to take effect January 1", "description": "As of January 1, 2020, the Government will impose a ban on the local manufacture, distribution and use of expanded polystyrene foam products used in the food and beverage", "image": "https://loopnewslive.blob.core.windows.net/liveimage/sites/default/files/2020-01/VxQKpLdW4l.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "http://www.loopjamaica.com/content/styrofoam-ban-take-effect-january-1"}
