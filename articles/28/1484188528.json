In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. \u2014 Viktor Frankl\n\nSilence.\n\nFrom peace to fear, being alone in silence can evoke many emotions within any leader.\n\nAnd it makes sense. In silence, we can really focus on getting our work done efficiently and without distraction. Our minds can drift to happy memories or exciting weekend plans. Or, silence can provide the space for stressful thoughts like looming deadlines, big presentations, or past imperfections.\n\nOverlook Corey Ruffner\n\nNow, what if there was a life tool that could help us cope with and control how we react to our thoughts? Imagine how it\u2019d not only boost our focus, but also enhance our ability to make better decisions in all kinds of situations.\n\nAs a leader, what\u2019s more important than that?\n\nThis is exactly what practicing mindfulness and meditation can train the mind to do, which is useful in a leadership position\u2014and life too! By learning to come to the present moment with awareness of our thoughts without judgement, we\u2019ll be better equipped to appropriately respond when it matters most.\n\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it. Countless other executive and entrepreneurial leaders from Bill Gates to Marc Benioff to Oprah also promote the merits of mindfulness. Even studies from Ivy League institutions like Harvard are uncovering the positive effects of meditation.\n\nLike anything though, it\u2019s hard to get started. Or, if you\u2019re already familiar with the practice, taking it to the next level can be just as difficult.\n\nSo, where do you go next? Maybe it\u2019s my nature as an entrepreneur, but I think the best way forward is to dive in headfirst.\n\nLet Go of the Fear\n\n\u201cI was surprised in a positive way by the silence. It was hard, but also really important to just be with myself. It freed up a lot of space in my mind.\u201d \u2014 Past donothing Retreat Participant\n\nIf embarking on a multi-day retreat in silence scares you, you\u2019re not alone. Personally, I\u2019ve been on over a dozen silent retreats and I still get nervous. Even today, I feel the butterflies before a new retreat begins. I also notice brain fill up with worries like:\n\nWill my business run fine without me?\n\nHow many emails will I have to respond to when I return?\n\nAm I going to get bored?\n\nWhich thoughts will pop into my mind?\n\nWhat will I do for so long without my iPhone!?\n\nToday, most humans simply aren\u2019t used to living without an instant connection to the world. However, we\u2019re didn\u2019t evolve to be as connected as we are today.\n\nIn fact, more studies are showing that the increasing dependence on our electronics are causing alarming spikes in anxiety, stress, and depression. It\u2019s severely affecting our quality of sleep, self-esteem, distraction levels, and work-life balance.\n\nThink of extended silence as a way to recalibrate our new, often inevitable, dependence on technology. By temporarily breaking this connection, we can both feel comfortable living without these devices while also finding gratitude for the benefits they do offer.\n\nSilence also provides us with uninterrupted time to focus on the one thing we too often neglect\u2014ourselves.\n\nWhat Really Happens At a Silent Retreat?\n\n\u201cI am able to bring the benefits of meditation back to my employees. I\u2019ve learned to treat everyone with more kindness. I\u2019m also handling employee challenges in a calmer, more productive way.\u201d \u2014 Past donothing Retreat Participant\n\nEvery silent retreat is different, so I certainly can\u2019t speak for all of them. What I can say though, is that the perfect mindfulness retreat experience is out there for you.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t think a meditation means you\u2019ll be sitting alone in a strange room for hours on end. It\u2019s actually quite the opposite! Many retreats involve regular movement and practices like mindful walking, stretching practices, hikes, meditation, and wisdom talks from the group leaders.\n\nAt the donothing Retreat, for example, we stay in silence for two of the days. Most meditation sessions last for about 25\u201345 minutes. Between meditating, we\u2019re off to walk through the mountains, eat a healthy meal, or just relax. Each of these events is designed to deepen your practice and teach mindful tools made to carry home with you.\n\nMost participants have found that the days fly by much faster than expected! They often leave feeling rejuvenated, rested, and inspired to take their leadership to the next level. They\u2019re also in awe of how closely they bonded with other attendees despite spending so much time in silence.\n\nLastly, the most important results happen after they return home. Most participants say they arrived back at the office feeling refreshed, refocused and reinvigorated not only as a leader, but in countless ways throughout their lives. They also notice a positive difference in their decision-making abilities, their reactions to tough questions, and their presence around others.\n\nEven if you attend once\u2014and decide that once is enough\u2014you\u2019ll still walk away with valuable mindfulness tools you\u2019ll carry for the rest of your life.\n\nWill it be a challenge? Absolutely, and it\u2019ll be the greatest, most rewarding leadership challenge of your life.\n\nReady to jump in feet first and join a mindfulness and meditation retreat? Whether it\u2019s at the donothing Leadership Retreat in Colorado from April 19\u201423, 2020, or one of the other amazing retreats located worldwide at locations like Spirit Rock, 1440 Multiversity, or elsewhere, I promise that you\u2019ll feel rewarded for a lifetime.\n\nConnect with me, Rob Dub\u00e9, on Twitter and LinkedIn and keep up with my company imageOne.
