We went to see the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 one of the great wonders of this planet \u2013 while we still can. Subject to the twin assaults of warming-caused bleaching and ocean acidification, it will be gone in a matter of decades in the absence of a dramatic reduction in global carbon emissions.\n\nWe also travelled to the Blue Mountains, another of Australia\u2019s natural wonders, known for its lush temperate rainforests, majestic cliffs and rock formations and panoramic vistas that challenge any the world has to offer. It too is now threatened by climate change.\n\nI witnessed this firsthand.\n\nI did not see vast expanses of rainforest framed by distant blue-tinged mountain ranges. Instead I looked out into smoke-filled valleys, with only the faintest ghosts of distant ridges and peaks in the background. The iconic blue tint (which derives from a haze formed from \u201cterpenes\u201d emitted by the Eucalyptus trees that are so plentiful here) was replaced by a brown haze. The blue sky, too, had been replaced by that brown haze.\n\nThe locals, whom I found to be friendly and outgoing, would volunteer that they have never seen anything like this before. Some even uttered the words \u201cclimate change\u201d without any prompting.\n\nThe songs of Peter Garrett and Midnight Oil I first enjoyed decades ago have taken on a whole new meaning for me now. They seem disturbingly prescient in light of what we are witnessing unfold in Australia.\n\nThe brown skies I observed in the Blue Mountains this week are a product of human-caused climate change. Take record heat, combine it with unprecedented drought in already dry regions and you get unprecedented bushfires like the ones engulfing the Blue Mountains and spreading across the continent. It\u2019s not complicated.\n\nTom Lowrey (@tomlowrey) The smoke is so thick in Katoomba tourists are opting for photos with billboards, rather than the Three Sisters themselves. @abcsydney pic.twitter.com/MOWvH8UBgs\n\nThe warming of our planet \u2013 and the changes in climate associated with it \u2013 are due to the fossil fuels we\u2019re burning: oil, whether at midnight or any other hour of the day, natural gas, and the biggest culprit of all, coal. That\u2019s not complicated either.\n\nWhen we mine for coal, like the controversial planned Adani coalmine, which would more than double Australia\u2019s coal-based carbon emissions, we are literally mining away at our blue skies. The Adani coalmine could rightly be renamed the Blue Sky mine.\n\nIn Australia, beds are burning. So are entire towns, irreplaceable forests and endangered and precious animal species such as the koala (arguably the world\u2019s only living plush toy) are perishing in massive numbers due to the unprecedented bushfires.\n\nThe continent of Australia is figuratively \u2013 and in some sense literally \u2013 on fire.\n\nYet the prime minister, Scott Morrison, appears remarkably indifferent to the climate emergency Australia is suffering through, having chosen to vacation in Hawaii as Australians are left to contend with unprecedented heat and bushfires.\n\nMorrison has shown himself to be beholden to coal interests and his administration is considered to have conspired with a small number of petrostates to sabotage the recent UN climate conference in Madrid (\u201cCOP25\u201d), seen as a last ditch effort to keep planetary warming below a level (1.5C) considered by many to constitute \u201cdangerous\u201d planetary warming.\n\nBut Australians need only wake up in the morning, turn on the television, read the newspaper or look out the window to see what is increasingly obvious to many \u2013 for Australia, dangerous climate change is already here. It\u2019s simply a matter of how much worse we\u2019re willing to allow it to get.\n\nAustralia is experiencing a climate emergency. It is literally burning. It needs leadership that is able to recognise that and act. And it needs voters to hold politicians accountable at the ballot box.\n\nAustralians must vote out fossil-fuelled politicians who have chosen to be part of the problem and vote in climate champions who are willing to solve it.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Sydney", "Climate change", "Australia news", "Environment", "Science", "Climate change", "Great Barrier Reef"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Michael Mann"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "I am a climate scientist on holiday in the Blue Mountains, watching climate change in action", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/fee5e2d638d1c35f6d501fa397e53329/152x152.png", "meta_data": {"description": "I am a climate scientist on holiday in the Blue Mountains, watching climate change in action", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Michael Mann", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a23008b42f324009a8acd74e48e423b085ab77cb/649_0_4659_2799/master/4659.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d153df24ee0aaecf9e0d3b45cf216751", "keywords": "Sydney,Climate change,Australia news,Environment,Science,Climate change,Great Barrier Reef", "news_keywords": "Sydney,Climate change,Australia news,Environment,Science,Climate change,Great Barrier Reef", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/02/australia-your-country-is-burning-dangerous-climate-change-is-here-with-you-now", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a23008b42f324009a8acd74e48e423b085ab77cb/649_0_4659_2799/master/4659.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b2d05b676ee29274f1e6514b53eab742", "description": "I am a climate scientist on holiday in the Blue Mountains, watching climate change in action", "type": "article", "title": "Australia, your country is burning \u2013 dangerous climate change is here with you now", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-e-mann", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2020-01-01T19:00:12.000Z", "tag": "Sydney,Climate change,Australia news,Environment,Science,Climate change,Great Barrier Reef", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T19:05:51.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://commentisfree/2020/jan/02/australia-your-country-is-burning-dangerous-climate-change-is-here-with-you-now?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://commentisfree/2020/jan/02/australia-your-country-is-burning-dangerous-climate-change-is-here-with-you-now?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/02/australia-your-country-is-burning-dangerous-climate-change-is-here-with-you-now", "iphone": "gnmguardian://commentisfree/2020/jan/02/australia-your-country-is-burning-dangerous-climate-change-is-here-with-you-now?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a23008b42f324009a8acd74e48e423b085ab77cb/649_0_4659_2799/master/4659.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=e7c624023bf92b921b845a847a073534", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/02/australia-your-country-is-burning-dangerous-climate-change-is-here-with-you-now"}
