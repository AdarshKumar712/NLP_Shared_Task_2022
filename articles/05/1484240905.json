The trial was expected to start in April. The date had not been set.\n\nHow the Japanese authorities might investigate Ghosn\u2019s escape and what action they might take on the apparent security lapses remains unclear.\n\nGhosn, who is of Lebanese origin and holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian passports, disclosed his location in a statement through his representatives but did not say how he managed to flee Japan. He promised to talk to reporters next week.\n\nHe said he wanted to avoid \u201cinjustice and political persecution.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am now in Lebanon and will no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied, in flagrant disregard of Japan\u2019s legal obligations under international law and treaties it is bound to uphold,\u201d the statement said.\n\nHis lawyer Junichiro Hironaka denied all knowledge of the escape, saying he was stunned. He said he didn\u2019t expect Ghosn to return to Japan.\n\nWhen asked if Ghosn had taken any of the documents being prepared for the trial, Hironaka acknowledged he hadn\u2019t checked but said he seriously doubted Ghosn would care about a trial he had taken such pains to avoid.\n\nJapanese media reports said Wednesday there were no official records of Ghosn\u2019s departure from the country, but a private jet had left from a regional airport to Turkey. One report said he sneaked out from his Tokyo home hiding in a case for a musical instrument.\n\nLebanon\u2019s minister for presidential affairs, Selim Jreissati, told the An-Nahar newspaper that Ghosn entered legally at the airport with a French passport and Lebanese ID.\n\nFrance has reacted with surprise and confusion, denying any knowledge.\n\nSpeculation is rife that a foreign or Japanese government, or both, might have been involved, or maybe just looked the other way to allow the escape to rid the public of a potentially embarrassing trial.\n\nWith him missing, Ghosn\u2019s trial is suspended.\n\nBut a trial is still pending against Nissan as a company and Greg Kelly, another Nissan executive. Kelly, an American, has said he is innocent.\n\nKelly\u2019s allegations overlap with those charges against Ghosn related to the underreporting of Ghosn\u2019s future compensation. Those charges are less serious than the additional breach of trust accusations against Ghosn.\n\nGhosn has been charged with breach of trust in having Nissan shoulder his personal investment losses, and diverting payments in Saudi Arabia and Oman for personal gain.\n\nHe has repeatedly asserted his innocence, saying authorities trumped up the charges to prevent a fuller merger between Nissan and alliance partner Renault SA.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Politics", "Columnists", "Odd News", "Volcano Coverage"], "authors": ["Associated Press"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/themes/staradvertiser/images/sa-favicon-16x16.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "fb": {"pages": 112299605447935}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "By jumping bail, fugitive Carlos Ghosn burns bridges to Japan", "description": "TOKYO >> By jumping bail, former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn, who had long insisted on his innocence, has now committed a clear crime and can never return to Japan without going to jail.", "url": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/01/01/breaking-news/by-jumping-bail-fugitive-carlos-ghosn-burns-bridges-to-japan/", "site_name": "Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/web1_9460312-0387e39b08914c839d10afdca4c7683d-300x200.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/staradvertiser/", "tag": "World news", "section": "Top News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T23:00:00-10:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "TOKYO >> By jumping bail, former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn, who had long insisted on his innocence, has now committed a clear crime and can never return to Japan without going to jail.", "title": "By jumping bail, fugitive Carlos Ghosn burns bridges to Japan | Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "site": "@staradvertiser", "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/web1_9460312-0387e39b08914c839d10afdca4c7683d.jpg", "creator": "@staradvertiser"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/01/01/breaking-news/by-jumping-bail-fugitive-carlos-ghosn-burns-bridges-to-japan/"}
