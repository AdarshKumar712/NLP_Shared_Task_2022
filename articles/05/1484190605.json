Cops say a 56-year-old Hasidic Jewish man was walking on Union Street between Albany Avenue and Kingston Avenue when a group of men, who appear to be teens, approached him from behind. One of the suspects punched the victim in the back of the head, knocking him down to the ground. Another one of them recorded the incident on his phone. The suspects then fled on foot.\n\nIn the second incident, which occurred just before 6 p.m. in the same area. A 23-year-old Hasidic Jewish man was walking on the sidewalk at Albany Avenue and Lincoln Place when the same group approached him. Police say one suspect struck the victim in the head with a chair and punched him in the face. Another one, who you can see in the video below, menaced the victim with a stick. The suspects fled on foot east on Union Street.\n\nThese incidents were among the series of anti-Semitic attacks that prompted Mayor Bill de Blasio to announce last week that the NYPD would increase their presence in Williamsburg, Crown Heights, and Borough Park.\n\nA local activist told the Post that one of the victims initially was reluctant to come forward about the attack because he was afraid of reprisals from the suspects: \u201cHe believes the justice system is so messed up he is not putting his name on file,\u201d Yaacov Behrman, the founder of the Jewish Future Alliance, told them. \u201cWhat do you tell someone like that?...Chances are his fears are legitimate because they are not going to hold the suspect.\u201d\n\nThe Hate Crime Task Force is investigating the incident. Anyone with information in regard to the identity of these individuals is asked to call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers website, or on Twitter.\n\nFollowing more than a dozen anti-Semitic incidents in the region this past month, including the deadly shooting at a Jersey City kosher market and a stabbing at a Hannukkah celebration at a rabbi's home in Rockland County, elected officials in Brooklyn's ultra-Orthodox communities called on Governor Andrew Cuomo to deploy the National Guard and more state police to patrol the borough earlier this week.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["#orthodox jews", "#nypd", "#hate crimes", "#Crown Heights", "#police", "#anti-semitic attack"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 12:06:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Hate Crime Task Force is investigating the incident.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "gothamist-web-client/config/environment": "%7B%22modulePrefix%22%3A%22gothamist-web-client%22%2C%22environment%22%3A%22production%22%2C%22rootURL%22%3A%22%2F%22%2C%22locationType%22%3A%22auto%22%2C%22EmberENV%22%3A%7B%22FEATURES%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22EXTEND_PROTOTYPES%22%3A%7B%22Date%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22_APPLICATION_TEMPLATE_WRAPPER%22%3Afalse%2C%22_JQUERY_INTEGRATION%22%3Afalse%2C%22_TEMPLATE_ONLY_GLIMMER_COMPONENTS%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%22APP%22%3A%7B%22wagtailImages%22%3A%7B%22imagePath%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fcms.prod.nypr.digital%2Fimages%22%7D%2C%22name%22%3A%22gothamist-web-client%22%2C%22version%22%3A%22v2.1.3%2B81dce779%22%7D%2C%22fastboot%22%3A%7B%22hostWhitelist%22%3A%5B%7B%7D%2C%7B%7D%2C%22www.gothamist.com%22%2C%22gothamist.com%22%2C%22gothamist-client.prod.nypr.digital%22%5D%7D%2C%22moment%22%3A%7B%22includeTimezone%22%3A%22all%22%7D%2C%22nypr-ads-htl%22%3A%7B%22scriptURL%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fhtlbid.com%2Fv3%2Fgothamist.com%2Fhtlbid.js%22%7D%2C%22ember-math-helpers%22%3A%7B%22only%22%3A%5B%22mod%22%5D%7D%2C%22ember-metrics%22%3A%7B%22includeAdapters%22%3A%5B%22chartbeat%22%5D%7D%2C%22metrics%22%3A%7B%22chartbeat%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A%2216246%22%2C%22domain%22%3A%22gothamist.com%22%7D%7D%2C%22cmsServer%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fcms.prod.nypr.digital%22%2C%22apiServer%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.wnyc.org%22%2C%22disqusAPI%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fdisqus.com%2Fapi%2F3.0%22%2C%22disqusKey%22%3A%22e6CVgEaLZqw0RNacE0YTx0PwnjyXh8X8QogknYzUX34hJ4k7EmUVPxVCD5FjHjqp%22%2C%22champEndpoint%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fchamp.gothamist.com%2Fchamp%2Fgothamist%22%2C%22wtcNewsletter%22%3A%228c376c6dff%22%2C%22dailyNewsletter%22%3A%2265dbec786b%22%2C%22commentsAnchor%22%3A%22comments%22%2C%22donateCookie%22%3A%22goth_donateToutClosed%22%2C%22articleViewsCookie%22%3A%22goth_articleViews%22%2C%22productBannerCookiePrefix%22%3A%22gothamist_product_banner_%22%2C%22siteId%22%3A2%2C%22etagAPI%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.wnyc.org%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fbrowser_id%2F%22%2C%22googleTagManager%22%3A%22GTM-M2S32K5%22%2C%22nypr-metrics%22%3A%7B%22disableEagerListenAnalytics%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%22ember-cli-mirage%22%3A%7B%22usingProxy%22%3Afalse%2C%22useDefaultPassthroughs%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%22exportApplicationGlobal%22%3Afalse%7D", "description": "The Hate Crime Task Force is investigating the incident.", "og": {"site_name": "Gothamist", "image": {"identifier": "https://cms.prod.nypr.digital/images/299173/fill-1200x650/", "width": 1200, "height": 650}, "url": "https://gothamist.com/news/police-orthodox-jewish-men-attacked-crown-heights-incidents-during-hanukkah", "title": "Police: Orthodox Jewish Men Attacked In Crown Heights Incidents During Hanukkah", "description": "The Hate Crime Task Force is investigating the incident.", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cms.prod.nypr.digital/images/299173/fill-1200x650/", "title": "Police: Orthodox Jewish Men Attacked In Crown Heights Incidents During Hanukkah", "description": "The Hate Crime Task Force is investigating the incident.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@gothamist"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T12:06:00-05:00", "section": "News", "tag": "anti-semitic attack,police,orthodox jews,Crown Heights,nypd,hate crimes", "author": "/staff/ben-yakas"}}, "canonical_link": "https://gothamist.com/news/police-orthodox-jewish-men-attacked-crown-heights-incidents-during-hanukkah"}
