Muilenburg's successor will be David Calhoun who, as a long-standing member of Boeing's board of directors, allowed Muilenburg to remain CEO for more than a year after the first 737 Max crash and after internal studies found that the jetliner posed an unacceptable risk of accident. It caused the deaths of 346 people.\n\nMuilenburg raked in $30 million in 2018. He could walk away from Boeing with another $60 million.\n\nLast August, the Business Roundtable an association of CEOs of America's biggest corporations, of which Muilenburg is a director announced with great fanfare a \"fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders\" (emphasis in the original) and not just their shareholders.\n\nRubbish. Corporate social responsibility is a sham.\n\nAnother Business Roundtable director is Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors. Just weeks after making the Roundtable commitment, and despite GM's hefty profits and large tax breaks, Barra rejected workers' demands that GM raise their wages and stop outsourcing their jobs. Earlier in the year GM shut its giant assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio.\n\nSome 50,000 GM workers then staged the longest auto strike in 50 years. They won a few wage gains but didn't save any jobs. Meanwhile, GM's stock has performed so well that Barra earned $22 million last year.\n\nAnother prominent Business Roundtable CEO who made the commitment to all his stakeholders is AT&T's Randall Stephenson, who promised to invest in the company's broadband network and create at least 7,000 new jobs with the billions the company received from the Trump tax cut.\n\nInstead, AT&T has cut more than 30,000 jobs since the tax cut went into effect.\n\nLet's not forget Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and its Whole Foods subsidiary. Just weeks after Bezos made the Business Roundtable commitment to all his stakeholders, Whole Foods announced it would be cutting medical benefits for its entire part-time workforce.\n\nThe annual saving to Amazon from this cost-cutting move is roughly what Bezos whose net worth is $110 billion makes in two hours. (Bezos's nearly-completed D.C. mansion will have 2 elevators, 25 bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, and a movie theater.)\n\nGE's CEO Larry Culp is also a member of the Business Roundtable. Two months after he made the commitment to all his stakeholders, General Electric froze the pensions of 20,000 workers in order to cut costs. Culp raked in $15 million last year.\n\nThe list goes on. Just in time for the holidays, US Steel announced 1,545 layoffs at two plants in Michigan. Last year, five US Steel executives received an average compensation package of $4.8 million, a 53 percent increase over 2017.\n\nInstead of a holiday bonus this year, Walmart offered its employees a 15 percent store discount. Oh, and did I say? Walmart saved $2.2 billion this year from the Trump tax cut.\n\nThe giant tax cut itself was a product of the Business Roundtable's extensive lobbying, lubricated by its generous campaign donations. Several of its member corporations, including Amazon and General Motors, wound up paying no federal income taxes at all last year.\n\nNext Page 1 | 2", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Amazon", "Corporate", "Corporate CEO Salaries", "Corporate Crime", "Jobs", "WalMart", "Workers"], "tags": ["Jobs", "Corporate", "WalMart", "Amazon", "Corporate Crime", "Corporate CEO Salaries", "Workers"], "authors": ["Robert Reich"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Article: The Sham of Corporate Social Responsibility - American corporations are sacrificing workers and communities as never before, in order to further boost record profits and unprecedented CEO pay.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"description": "Article: The Sham of Corporate Social Responsibility - American corporations are sacrificing workers and communities as never before, in order to further boost record profits and unprecedented CEO pay.", "keywords": "Amazon,Corporate,Corporate CEO Salaries,Corporate Crime,Jobs,WalMart,Workers", "fb": {"admins": 737810614, "app_id": 157889207614942}, "generator": "Populum - \ufeffContent management software for hybrid blog/media/commerce communities", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"url": "https://www.opednews.com/articles/The-Sham-of-Corporate-Soci-by-Robert-Reich-Amazon_Corporate_Corporate-CEO-Salaries_Corporate-Crime-200101-688.html", "site_name": "OpEdNews", "title": "The Sham of Corporate Social Responsibility", "description": "American corporations are sacrificing workers and communities as never before, in order to further boost record profits and unprecedented CEO pay.", "image": {"identifier": "images/fblogo.gif", "width": 1024, "height": 1024}, "type": "website", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"title": "The Sham of Corporate Social Responsibility", "description": "American corporations are sacrificing workers and communities as never before, in order to further boost record profits and unprecedented CEO pay.", "image": "images/fblogo.gif", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@opednews"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.opednews.com/articles/The-Sham-of-Corporate-Soci-by-Robert-Reich-Amazon_Corporate_Corporate-CEO-Salaries_Corporate-Crime-200101-688.html"}
