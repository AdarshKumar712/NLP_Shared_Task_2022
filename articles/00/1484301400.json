Authorities are forecasting growth of between 0.5 percent and 2.5 percent this year.\n\nThe services and construction sectors offset weakness in manufacturing, helping the economy grow at a slightly faster pace in the fourth quarter.\n\nGDP grew 0.8 percent in October-December from the same period a year ago, compared with a revised 0.7 percent in the previous quarter, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a statement.\n\nAnalysts had expected GDP growth of 0.8 percent.\n\nThe economy grew 0.1 percent quarter-on-quarter on an annualised and seasonally adjusted basis, compared with an upwardly revised 2.4 percent rise the quarter before. Analysts had expected a 0.4 percent expansion.\n\n\u201cThe global economic slowdown has already affected us. This year we avoided a recession. Our economy is still growing, but less vigorously than we would like,\u201d Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his annual New Year message on December 31.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Stay Fit", "#GST", "Life etc", "Tech Toyz", "Startup", "Explainers", "Food for thought", "Tax", "Singapore economy news", "Boardroom Results", "Big Deal", "Overdrive", "Market analysts", "Smart Living", "Money Money Money", "Storyboard", "#CyrusMistry", "Dress for Success", "Young Turks", "Startup Street", "Singapore", "Entrepreneurship", "Changing India", "Interviews", "US-China trade war"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The export-oriented economy has been hit hard by the drawn-out trade war between the United States and China as well as a cyclical global downturn in the electronics sector.Get latest Economy online at cnbctv18.com", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.cnbctv18.com/assets/images/cnbc-logo.png?v=1.png", "meta_data": {"description": "The export-oriented economy has been hit hard by the drawn-out trade war between the United States and China as well as a cyclical global downturn in the electronics sector.Get latest Economy online at cnbctv18.com", "news_keywords": "Singapore, Singapore economy, GDP growth fourth quarter 2019, US China trade war, Singapore Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore economy news", "Keywords": "Singapore, Singapore economy, GDP growth fourth quarter 2019, US China trade war, Singapore Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore economy news", "robots": "NOODP", "Last-Modified": "January 02, 2020 07:42 AM IST", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "cnbctv18.com", "type": "website", "url": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/singapore-economy-expands-07-percent-in-2019-slowest-in-a-decade-4979391.htm", "title": "Singapore economy expands 0.7 percent in 2019, slowest in a decade", "description": "The export-oriented economy has been hit hard by the drawn-out trade war between the United States and China as well as a cyclical global downturn in the electronics sector.Get latest Economy online at cnbctv18.com", "image": "https://images.cnbctv18.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-11T014816Z_1_LYNXMPEFBA02P_RTROPTP_4_SOUTHEASTASIA-HAZE-768x500.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@cnbctv18com", "creator": "@cnbctv18com", "url": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/singapore-economy-expands-07-percent-in-2019-slowest-in-a-decade-4979391.htm?v=1", "title": "Singapore economy expands 0.7 percent in 2019, slowest in a decade", "image": {"src": "https://images.cnbctv18.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-11T014816Z_1_LYNXMPEFBA02P_RTROPTP_4_SOUTHEASTASIA-HAZE-768x500.jpg"}}, "fb": {"pages": 169218193115587}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dailymotion-domain-verification": "dm7bwnm8yezsnexa3"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/singapore-economy-expands-07-percent-in-2019-slowest-in-a-decade-4979391.htm"}
