He thought Taylor would give the team instructions for the weekend\u2019s game or a critique of their practice that day. But when Taylor told the band, known as the \u201cHuman Jukebox,\u201d that they had been selected to perform in the 2020 Rose Parade, Soberanis-Ramos\u2019 heart leapt with excitement.\n\n\u201cI was in shock because we were going to be in my backyard,\u201d said Soberanis-Ramos, a Compton native. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I never thought I would do before. To be a part of this, it\u2019s simply a blessing.\u201d\n\nSoberanis-Ramos, 19, said he always watched the Rose Parade on television growing up, but could never make the 23-mile drive to Pasadena to see the New Year\u2019s Day festivities in person. Instead, choosing to attend a historically black university in Baton Rouge, La., unexpectedly had provided him with an opportunity he had dreamed of. Merely being in the parade, he said, \u201cgives me hope.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s what this year\u2019s parade is all about.\n\nTournament of Roses President Laura Farber thought of this year\u2019s theme, \u201cThe Power of Hope,\u201d with people like Soberanis- Ramos in mind. Farber, the first Latina to serve in the role, said she wanted to use her platform to promote diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe Human Jukebox, along with many of the other bands that will perform, embody that, she said. She\u2019s excited for Southern California and the rest of the world to see that impact.\n\nZaid Soberanis-Ramos, right, adjusts his hat while waiting to perform with the Southern University Band during Bandfest at Pasadena City College. (Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cWith the country and the world as divided as it is right now, we want hope to bring everyone together,\u201d Farber said. \u201cThat\u2019s what America\u2019s New Year celebration does. Hope is a powerful concept, and we wanted to focus on that.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201chope\u201d had never been used in the previous 130 Rose Bowl themes, Farber said. Her life revolved around hope, she said, and she knew that the word would resonate with others if she centered the parade on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFarber was born in Argentina and immigrated to the United States with her family when she was young to escape the country\u2019s military dictatorship that seized power in the mid-1970s. She graduated from UCLA in 1987 and then from Georgetown Law three years later. Today she\u2019s a wife, mother and attorney in Pasadena. She volunteered for the Tournament of Roses for 26 years and slowly climbed the ranks.\n\nLaura Farber, president of the 2020 Tournament of Roses, steps to the stage to announce the 2020 Royal Court. (Tim Berger/La Ca\u00f1ada Valley Sun)\n\nWith each passing year, she saw the leadership diversify. The past five years produced the first African American and the first Asian American presidents of the organization. Farber said the best part of the job is the people. Hearing their stories inspires her.\n\n\u201cSometimes you don\u2019t appreciate the impact of our events until you meet people and see how engaged they are,\u201d Farber said. \u201cIt changes them, especially kids who have never left their towns or cities and are now playing on a big international stage.\u201d\n\nThat description fits Soberanis-Ramos, who started playing the horn at Manuel Dominguez High in Compton.\n\nHis parents, who immigrated from Mexico before he and his four younger siblings were born, never attended college and worked hard to support them, he said. He used band as a way to keep himself busy. He practiced for hours by himself, meticulously going over songs and honing his technique. He wanted to use music to better his life, he said.\n\n\u201cAll the dedication and hard work started paying off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was getting me ready for the real world \u2014 the practices, the uniforms, the precision. When you see the joy on people\u2019s faces when you do a song and their heads are bopping, it makes it all worth it.\u201d\n\nSoberanis-Ramos, a computer science major who wants to work with mobile technology, said that a friend told him about Southern University, and he began watching videos of the marching band on YouTube. He saw \u201cone of the best bands in the world,\u201d as Farber describes them.\n\nZaid Soberanis-Ramos, right, warms up with his 200-plus member squad, the Southern University marching band, a.k.a. the \u201cHuman Jukebox,\u201d at Pasadena City College. (Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe Southern University Band plays on the field at Bandfest at Pasadena City College. (Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe band is used to performing at elite venues. Since its creation in 1947, it has played at Super Bowls, presidential inaugurations and the 1980 Rose Parade. Most famously, it headlined the reopening of the Louisiana Superdome in 2006 after Hurricane Katrina. After researching and witnessing what the band stood for, Soberanis- Ramos knew that he wanted to be a part of it. He auditioned and was accepted.\n\nSoberanis- Ramos said that attending a historically black university was eye-opening at first, noting the Southern hospitality that pervaded the campus. The positive energy and genuine sense of camaraderie gave him \u201ca huge culture shock,\u201d he said. He and his band mates now carry those unique feelings with them to Pasadena.\n\nBands from historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) are known for their pride and competitiveness. In 2017, ESPN\u2019s The Undefeated ranked the Human Jukebox as the best HBCU band in the country. It has called itself the \u201cHuman Jukebox\u201d since the 1960s because it boasts that it can play the \u201cTop 40\u201d hits of the day.\n\nRecently, it\u2019s lived up to the name.\n\nAt Bandfest, a showcase of the parade bands on Dec. 30, they dressed in their powder uniforms and yellow capes, and moved across the whole field of Pasadena City College stadium, dipping and weaving into different formations while they performed Lil Nas\u2019 hit \u201cOld Town Road.\u201d Farber even started dancing as she watched from the sideline.\n\nLizzo, the Associated Press entertainer of the year, featured the band in a December music video. It also performed at a church service and a Los Angeles Lakers halftime show in Staples Center while they were in Los Angeles.\n\nMembers of the Southern University Marching Band gather their instruments at their busses for Bandfest at Pasadena City College. (Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times)\n\nTaylor said that Soberanis-Ramos is a great ambassador for the band, and he is happy they\u2019ll play near the student\u2019s hometown. Taylor also is glad that the Human Jukebox may provide some Californians with their first introduction to an HBCU band. He\u2019s especially pleased that they are participating in this year of \u201cHope.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis theme fits our program to a T,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cGod created all of us as equal, and when you have everybody on the same page and pulling in the same direction, you can accomplish way more.\u201d\n\nSoberanis- Ramos said it\u2019s important to put on a performance that spectators won\u2019t forget, especially given this year\u2019s theme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming back home, and I want people here to see what HBCUs stand for and what we\u2019re about,\u201d he said. \u201cI want them to see the passion we have and hopefully it will open their eyes. We\u2019re carrying a lot of weight.\u201d\n\nBands from Denmark, El Salvador, Japan and seven other counties will play at the parade, along with bands from 47 states. Farber said it was easy to pick Southern University when she and the music committee sifted through the pile of applications.\n\nThe 1 million people expected to watch the performance in person will be \u201cblown away,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just going to lift everybody up,\u201d she said.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Emmanuel Morgan Is A Former Reporter For The Los Angeles Times.
