But these are not normal times. Seemingly endless political conflicts have created a climate of anger, anxiety and agitation in many quarters, leading to a heightened pessimism about the future.\n\nBut while our disputes have indeed become more vitriolic and divisive, it\u2019s important to take a more complete and thoughtful inventory of the times. For as we start 2020, the nation \u2014 and the entire world \u2014 has many reasons to celebrate.\n\n\u201cJust about every measure of human welfare is improving except one: hope,\u201d John Tierney and Roy F. Baumeister noted in an op-ed in Saturday\u2019s Wall Street Journal.\n\nThis disconnect, they believe, stems from the fact that people tend to emphasize the bad over the good. \u201cOur minds and lives are skewed by a fundamental imbalance that is just now becoming clear to scientists: the negativity effect,\u201d the authors write, adding, \u201cWe focus so much on bad news, especially in a digital world that magnifies its power, that we don\u2019t realize how much better life is becoming for people around the world.\u201d\n\nOver the past 25 years, for instance, the number of people living in \u201cextreme\u201d poverty \u2014 as defined by the World Bank \u2014 has dropped by a remarkable 75 percent.\n\nIn his book \u201cFewer, Richer, Greener,\u201d Laurence Siegel of the CFA Institute argues that markets and democratic institutions have led to dramatic improvements in living standards. As the world becomes richer, he forecasts, population growth will slow and cause less stress on the ecosystem.\n\nMr. \u201cSiegel provides reams of solid data for similarly heartening global trends,\u201d writes Ronald Bailey of Reason magazine. \u201cCrop productivity, food availability, life expectancy and education are increasing; violence is in decline.\u201d As for the pessimists, Mr. Siegel has a message: \u201cLet us not teach our children that apocalyptic thinking is right thinking. (It) has always been wrong as a forecast, and it will continue to be wrong. \u2026 Life has improved tremendously in the past 250 years \u2026 (and) it will continue to improve in almost every dimension; health, wealth, longevity, nutrition, literacy, peace, freedom and so forth.\u201d\n\nDespite the turmoil in Washington, the United States remains a beacon of hope and opportunity for the world. The Constitution will continue to withstand the stress tests of Beltway hyperpartisanship.\n\n\u201cBy rationally looking at the long-term trends instead of viscerally reacting to the horror story of the day, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s much more to celebrate than to mourn,\u201d write Mr. Tierney and Mr. Baumeister. \u201cNo matter \u2026 who wins the presidential election, the average person in America and the rest of the world will in all likelihood become healthier and wealthier.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s a reason to toast 2020 rather than to fear it.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["mc-opinion"], "authors": ["Las Vegas Review-Journal"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 05:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "\u201cLife has improved tremendously in the past 250 years \u2026 (and) it will continue to improve in almost every dimension; health, wealth, longevity, nutrition, literacy, peace, freedom and so forth.\u201d", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/themes/rjth2019/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "google-site-verification": "AITU7N4mIKhMm3SZLODmtXsbFcjBhPEYsQ6t2-e38h8", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "description": "\u201cLife has improved tremendously in the past 250 years \u2026 (and) it will continue to improve in almost every dimension; health, wealth, longevity, nutrition, literacy, peace, freedom and so forth.\u201d", "rj": {"id": "post_id-1925630", "paywall": "private"}, "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "type": "article", "title": "EDITORIAL: There\u2019s much to celebrate at the onset of a new decade", "url": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-theres-much-to-celebrate-at-the-onset-of-a-new-decade-1925630/", "description": "\u201cLife has improved tremendously in the past 250 years \u2026 (and) it will continue to improve in almost every dimension; health, wealth, longevity, nutrition, literacy, peace, freedom and s...", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/13178231_web1_2020optimismweb.jpg", "width": 1050, "height": 700}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T05:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T06:05:49+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reviewjournal", "title": "EDITORIAL: There\u2019s much to celebrate at the onset of a new decade", "description": "\u201cLife has improved tremendously in the past 250 years \u2026 (and) it will continue to improve in almost every dimension; health, wealth, longevity, nutrition, literacy, peace, freedom and s...", "image": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/13178231_web1_2020optimismweb.jpg"}, "msapplication-config": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/themes/rjth2019/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-theres-much-to-celebrate-at-the-onset-of-a-new-decade-1925630/"}
