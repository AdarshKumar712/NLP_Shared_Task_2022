The development will be the first discount mall in Pernambuco and the third in the Northeast region. About 80% of the investment will be financed with money from development lender Bank of the Northeast (BNB) and the rest with BCI's own capital. The outlet mall is a diversification of the group's activities, which last year earned R$7.9 billion with fuel imports, ethanol trading, liquid bulk storage and the manufacturing of 50-cylinder motorcycles under Chinese brand Shineray, in addition to real estate. With a total area of 500,000 square meters, the development is expected to be delivered to retailers in July and to open its doors to shoppers in October.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["brazil stock", "brazil investment", "brazil market", "investments in brazil"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Fuel distributor BCI invests in outlet mall", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/misc/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "keywords": "brazil stock, brazil investment, brazil market, investments in brazil", "description": "Fuel distributor BCI invests in outlet mall", "fb": {"pages": 197587446941661}}, "canonical_link": ""}
