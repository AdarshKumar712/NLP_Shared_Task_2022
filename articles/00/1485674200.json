Candles, plug-ins, sprays, essential oils, soaps, cleaning products\u2026 anything that can make my home smell wonderful I love.\n\nI\u2019ve always loved nice smelling things. Even when I was younger. I used to love to pick the lilacs that surrounded our home and keep them in my bedroom just so I could smell them and to make my room smell nice.\n\nWhen it comes to my home, I like to make my home smell nice for family and friends, as well as myself.\n\nI am also a firm believer that scents can evoke memories and change your mood. For that reason, I make sure to scent my home some way, every day.\n\nI love all kinds of scents, especially seasonal ones (pumpkin, pumpkin spice, beach\u2026). My all time favorite scents are lilac and that of a REAL Christmas tree. The problem is, most scented products don\u2019t smell like the real thing. Most smell artificial. Some artificial scents are OK, but anything that smells real is so much better.\n\nBefore the holidays I was introduced to the brand Mer-Sea. Mer-Sea room sprays are made with essential oils. Their sprays are packaged in 4 ounce glass glass bottles with a spray top. I think the glass bottles are pretty, and I was happy to keep it out for all to see during the holiday season. It\u2019s not like a regular room spray bottle.\n\nMer-Sea has a lovely color palette too. Their products are colored with sea-salt bleached hues of white, grey, and blue mixed with little flashes of silver and is a fusion of all the colors found in the sea. So pretty!\n\nI was sent to review their Sea Pines scented spray.\n\nI would never think to associate pine trees with the ocean, but I forgot about Maine. Maine does have pine trees that are near the sea. That would explain this scent.\n\nFrom the rocky coast of Maine to the shores of California, pines release a fresh crisp scent that will awaken your senses. Perfect for everyday, but especially the holidays. Sea Pines will bring the outside in and stay for a nice visit.\n\nRemember how I said I like scents that smell REAL? A REAL Christmas tree smelling scent is one of the hardest scents to come by, at least for me. Every Christmas tree scent I have found (candle, spray, plug-in) does not smell like a real Christmas tree. Some have been close, but nothing truly smelled like the real thing. That is until the first time I sprayed the Mer-Sea Sea Pines scented spray.\n\nOH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!\n\nThis scent is the closest to a real Christmas tree than any other pine/Christmas tree scented product I have ever tried \u2013 and I\u2019ve been looking for DECADES.\n\nMy husband and both of our children agree that this scent smells identical to a real Christmas tree.\n\nI am IN LOVE!\n\nWe can\u2019t really have a real tree in our home. Aside from our six cats, the tree would have to be placed directly in front of the sliding glass doors and would receive direct sunlight all day long. It would dry out too quickly for us to enjoy it. For that reason we need to have an artificial tree. It\u2019s a lovely tree, but it\u2019s not a real tree and therefore doesn\u2019t have that real tree scent I have been dreaming of.\n\nI sprayed the Mer-Sea Sea Pines spray on our tree twice a day during the holiday season, so we could smell it every time we walked by the tree (usually a spray in the morning and again in the evening). I also sprayed it around our home, just to bring the amazing Sea Pine scent to all areas of our home.\n\nMer-Sea has other interesting sounding scented room sprays (the Sea Pine is still available). Other scents include Coconut Sugar, Pique-Nique, Good Spirits, Fog, Voyager, Saltaire and Sun Kissed.\n\nThe room sprays sell for $19, which is a bit more than the kind you can find at your local department or grocery store, but remember, you are getting quality scented room sprays made with essential oils and not chemical smelling ingredients. That old expression, \u201cYou get what you pay for,\u201d is true. You are paying a bit more, but you are getting a higher quality product too.\n\nMer-Sea sells more than just room sprays. They also sell sweaters, wraps, candles, soaps, lotions, bags, blankets and so much more.\n\nIf you would like to check out all that Mer-Sea has to offer, visit MerSea.com. The brand can also be found on social media. Their links are located on the top left of their home page.\n\nAre you a fan of scented products? Do you have a particular favorite?
