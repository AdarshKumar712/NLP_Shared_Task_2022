They said that due to this ambiguity instead of urgent installation and the machines were dumped at the store. The issue was finally taken up by the probing agencies after which documents were supplied to the relevant hospitals in the province which later also received these machines.\n\nThe sources said 14 old dialysis machines have now been kept aside as 40 to 45 kidney-failure patients are daily receiving dialysis each for 3 to 3.30 hours whenever they needed it. They said 160 dialysis patients are registered at the moment, who belong to various areas out of which 85 are hepatitis negative, 60 hepatitis positive and 15 are HIV positive.\n\nFive machines are reserved for Hepatitis negative, five for hepatitis positive and four for HIV positive patients (out of which two are working and the remaining two are dysfunctional).\n\nWhen this scribe visited the site there was no female staff nurse posted to look after the female patients and all work was done by the male staff.\n\nDuty doctors said on condition of anonymity as they have been banned from talking to media they could not say anything. However, they said that they have been facing acute shortage of medics and paramedics since long but the CMCH authorities are not paying heed to their several complaints.\n\nThey said five dialysis technicians are posted against the need of 10 technicians, six doctors are posted against the demand of 12 who work in three shifts. They said that this vital ward has even no ward boy and a man has been hired by them on daily wages basis out of their own pocket.\n\nCCTV cameras have already been installed to monitor the dialysis process but an acute shortage of trained manpower has added to the woes of patients.\n\nHead of Department Dr Zahid Shaikh said that despite some shortcomings the Center is now working smoothly for the benefit of poverty-ridden dialysis patients. He said a shortage of required medics and paramedics would also be tackled so that workload could be reduced.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/wp-content/themes/focus/assets/img/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 149267971770920}, "google-site-verification": "cecV0Kp7fVbQqEyyglHMAQ9kYCmnv_xp8GwshXyhU2s", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@", "site": "@"}, "og": {"title": "Eight dialysis machines non-functional in Larkana hospital", "description": "LARKANA:\u00a0Eight out of 20 new dialysis machines are dysfunctional because of faulty RO plant at Chandka Medical College Hospital, Larkana.
