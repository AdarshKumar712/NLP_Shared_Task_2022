Banks and businesses identified with mainland China have been frequent targets of hardcore protesters.\n\nProtesters also hurled Molotov cocktails and garbage at officers in the Wan Chai district through which the march route passed.\n\nPolice used pepper spray and tear gas to drive off the demonstrators, although a government statement said officers had been \"deploying the minimum necessary force\" in dispersing the group.\n\nMarch participants were asked to \"disperse soon after it ends and not to take part in any illegal or violent acts that may occur.\n\n\"To safeguard the rule of law and public peace, the police will enforce the law strictly,\" the statement said.\n\nA toned-down New Year's Eve\n\nThe massive rally followed overnight clashes between police and protesters on New Year's Eve in a densely populated shopping district. Police also used tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons to break up groups of demonstrators who blocked traffic and lit fires in the street in the working-class district of Mong Kok.\n\nHong Kong toned down its New Year's Eve celebrations amid the protests that began in June and have dealt severe blows to the city's retail, tourism and nightlife sectors.\n\nAn anti-government protester paints graffiti during the New Year's Day demonstration calling for better governance and democratic reforms in Hong Kong. (Navesh Chitrakar/Reuters)\n\nEric Lai, vice-convener of the march organizer, the Civil Human Rights Front, said he hoped to avoid a recurrence of the previous night's violence.\n\n\"I really hope that this will be a peaceful protest,\" Lai said. \"We hope that the police can facilitate us, rather than provoking us, and to fire tear gas and water cannon at us.\"\n\nSuch marches have often devolved at their conclusion into violence between hardcore, black-clad protesters and police. Both sides have been accused of provoking clashes, and nearly 6,500 protesters have been arrested in scores of incidents on streets, in shopping malls and on college campuses.\n\n\"It's hard to utter 'Happy New Year' because Hong Kong people are not happy,\" said Tung, who was walking with his two-year-old son, mother and niece, and used only one name.\n\n\"Unless the five demands are achieved, and police are held accountable for their brutality, then we can't have a real happy new year.\"\n\nPolice detain a protester in Hong Kong on Jan. 1.

(Vincent Yu/The Associated Press)\n\nRecent protests have drawn participants from across Hong Kong society, sometimes numbering more than one million and packing the downtown area, from Victoria Park to the government office complex a short distance away.\n\nThey're concerned about an erosion of the former British colony's civil liberties it was promised after being handed over to Chinese rule in 1997, along with a shortage of well-paying jobs and a yawning divide between the city's ruling class and those merely getting by amid soaring housing costs.\n\nLam says 2019 brought 'sadness, rage'\n\nThis year's event appeared to be significantly larger than in past years, although estimates of the numbers of participants often vary widely between organizers and police.\n\nThe protests are over proposed legislation that could have allowed residents to be extradited to China where they could face possible torture and unfair trials. The legislation was withdrawn, but not before the protests expanded to wider calls for reforms in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n\nProtesters also gathered Tuesday at the Prince Edward subway station where police four months ago had rushed in, beating and tear gassing demonstrators who had no way to flee. That incident is among many cited by demonstrators as cases of police abuse for which no one has been held accountable.\n\nLam said the months of protests had brought \"sadness, anxiety, disappointment and even rage,\" and vowed to tackle underlying social and economic problems in the coming year.\n\nLam said she would \"listen humbly\" in an attempt to end the protests, but also reinforced the importance of the \"one-country, two-systems\" framework under which China rules Hong Kong and which brooks no challenge to the ruling Communist Party's ultimate authority.\n\nIn his own address, Chinese President Xi Jinping referred to the protests, saying \"Hong Kong's prosperity and stability is the wish of Hong Kong compatriots and the expectation for the people of the motherland.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A huge crowd gathered in Hong Kong on Wednesday for an annual New Year's Day protest march as the months-long pro-democracy movement extends into 2020.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/a/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=cbcnews, cbcnews://1.5412261", "og": {"site_name": "CBC", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-protests-new-years-day-1.5412261", "title": "Hong Kong protesters' 1st 2020 rally mostly orderly but 5 arrests | CBC News", "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5412264.1577878298!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hong-kong-protests-new-year-s-day.JPG", "description": "A huge crowd gathered in Hong Kong on Wednesday for an annual New Year's Day protest march as the months-long pro-democracy movement extends into 2020.", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 5823419603}, "vf": {"section": "2.633", "unique_id": "1.5412261"}, "google-site-verification": "pJy_QmRvDz2tr7X8eQ6Y1L3Se-8RWM_PpJX42Pr_fYo", "twitter": {"site": "@cbc", "player": {"width": 640, "height": 360}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "A huge crowd gathered in Hong Kong on Wednesday for an annual New Year's Day protest march as the months-long pro-democracy movement extends into 2020."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-protests-new-years-day-1.5412261"}
