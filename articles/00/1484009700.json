The nonprofit, which delivers an evidence-based, structured Workforce Prep program for students throughout metro Detroit, benefited this football season from Comerica Bank\u2019s First Down Program where Comerica pledged $100 for each first down the Lions gained at Ford Field this year. The program culminated with an $18,000 gift to support Winning Futures and its programs, including in-class mentoring, life skills development, goal setting, job readiness training, and career exploration.\n\nSince 1994, Winning Futures has positively impacted approximately 49,000 students and awarded $1.9 million in scholarships. The nonprofit delivers an evidence-based, structured Workforce Prep program for students throughout metro Detroit, and with help from volunteer mentors and partnerships within the business community, Winning Futures transforms students into self-reliant, employable, and productive adults with defined academic and career goals, and highly desirable workforce skills.\n\n\u201cWe congratulate Winning Futures and their team of committed volunteers for their success in providing transformative experiences for our young people. The Winning Futures program connects students to mentors and other valuable resources that will help them be better prepared for the future.\u201d said Michael Cheatham, Comerica Bank Vice President and Michigan External Affairs Market Manager. \u201cWe proudly support Kristina, Winning Futures, and all who share their time, talent and resources to inspire our youth.\u201d\n\nComerica Bank donated $18,000 to Beyond Basics in 2018, and in 2017, gave an additional $18,000 to Children\u2019s Hospital. With an additional $18,000 donation to Winning Futures this year, Comerica has donated $54,000 through the First Down Program to nonprofits in metro Detroit.\n\nWinning Futures president and CEO Kristina Marshall is very thankful to benefit from this partnership between Comerica Bank and the Lions and says this will help the nonprofit continue to provide valuable services to youth in metro Detroit.\n\n\u201cThe funds from the Detroit Lions First Down Program was a great, unexpected surprise this season,\u201d Marshall said. As we roll out our expanded four-year program, the contribution will support students having hands-on career exploration experiences, developing their five-year education and career plans, and being matched with a career mentor. New this year, students are completing department rotations and projects at local corporations, along with participating in a job experience fair where they can test out careers that interested them.\u201d\n\nCorporate social responsibility has long been a focus for Comerica Bank, and efforts like the Lions First Down program are part of Comerica\u2019s strong commitment to the local community.
