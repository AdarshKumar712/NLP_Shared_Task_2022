The Austrian Chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said the masks would be handed out in front of supermarkets and that it will be compulsory to wear them.\n\nThe US and Germany are considering similar measures - but the current advice in much of the world is still that sick people should wear them not the healthy - except for health professionals and others in close contact with those with coronavirus.\n\nDoctor Hanns-Christoph N\u00e4gerl from the University of Innsbruck is one of three scientists who wrote to the Austrian government asking them to make masks compulsory. He presents the argument for masks and says that wearing masks can protect people near to you - even if you're not showing symptoms.\n\n(Photo: A man wears a face mask while food shopping in Vienna.
