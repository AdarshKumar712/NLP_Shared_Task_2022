Links to each of these contests can be found on the CCOHS Young Workers Zone website. The first-place winners of these contests will be entered into the national contest.\n\nRegional Qualifier Contest\n\nThis new contest is open to youth ages 13-19 who reside in provinces that are not running youth video contests (a complete listing can be found on the Young Workers Zone website). The winning individual or team will receive $1,000 and the winning video will be entered into the national Focus on Safety Youth Video Contest. Video submissions for this category must be received by 4:00 p.m. EDT on Thursday, March 19, 2020.
