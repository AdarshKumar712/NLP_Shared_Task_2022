James Gargasoulas states that he is not evil. Thats a controversy because he killed all those people with his car. Writing letters to the families who have lost their loved ones is of no avail. The dead cannot come back &amp; James should have known that as well as any kid. Apologies mean nothing. He kills then apologises for what he's done. Getting into a rage, depressive issues, states of mind etc. etc.are all no excuses. James Gargasoulas has murdered those people, not with a knife or a gun or an axe but with his car. The act behind it is nonetheless the same. Unfortunately, with death, the situation cannot be reversed.</div>

Barely over a week ago, a retarded rapper monkey, Codey Kulla Kulla MyCunt Hermann killed an exchange student near the Polaris Cafe, Bundoora &amp; now, 2 teenagers were attacked by 20 African youths at the Wyndham Vale bus/train station. So much for public safety in Melbourne ! Where are the police ? Having coffee &amp; watching The Simpsons ? Get the North Vietnamese Police in to set matters right.</div>

The Chinese are always putting their feelers out for business ventures. For them, a visit is to find out if money can start piling up. The biggest Melbourne retard of the year is none other than Aboriginal Codey Kulla Kulla a.k.a MC Cuntdez Herrman, with the brains of a slug. Retribution will be coming Codey's way. Unfortunately for Codey, he asked for it.</div>

Since Melbourne was overtaken by the Chinese, the city has been awash with drugs, heroin and crystal meth are out of control and the crime that comes with a drug epidemic has escalated considerably.<br/>
Melbourne is now the capital of car thefts, home invasions and muggings. Hit and runs by drug affected youth is a daily occurrence.<br/>
There is also a massive new migrant population from India so you get the sexual assaults that comes with that, be very vigilant on public transport.<br/>
There has also been a number of Islamic terror attacks either carried out or caught in the late planning stages, these are usually covered up by the media as mental illness issues but everyone knows what they are.<br/>
All in all, a multicultural nightmare and the only tourists still stupid enough to come here are the Chinese.</div>

You don't have to pen dark lyrics about demons, Codey Fuck Arse Hermann. Just look in the mirror &amp; you'll see a black pig with a grin as wide as his arse crack. Jihadis know about what you've done, black pig. Your black body will be tortured for that. You think it will all be over for you ? Oh, no ! Even the beginning has not started as yet. You'll find out soon. You are a djinn/demon inside a black body, Codey. When they have done you up, your balls will start talking to your cock ! No chance of escape, Codey Hermann. Sorry.</div>

You hear the news, Melbournians ? Sean Price, who stabbed Masa Vukotic to death(49 times) in 2015, wants his life jail sentence cut short ! Sean Price, who has a track record of raping women, wants to be as free as a lark ! Yes, Price could be &#34;free&#34; provided he is sent to ISIS for further treatment ! In fact, Jill Meagher's killer(Adrian) &amp; Aiia Maasawe's killer(Codey Hermann) too, can also be sent to ISIS to be &#34;free&#34; !!<br/>

In 2015, schoolgirl(aged 17), Masa Vukotic, was killed by Sean Price just because Masa was &#34;talking&#34; to a bird. In the same line of argument Sean Price should be killed too, as he(Sean) is off his rocker.<br/>
Sean Price can get his cock up Codey Herman's arse while Codey sucks Sean's dick ! Codey can rap Sean's arse<br/>

Aboriginals like Codey Hermann pollute the environment just by their existence. Aboriginal or otherwise, there should be no light sentences for this black dog who has brought death, grief &amp; agony to the Maarsawe family. <br/>
There is no guarantee that Codey Hermann will not repeat this act of his.To be absolutely certain Codey does not &#34;re offend&#34;, just slice off both his hands. Codey Hermann ought to be tortured for what he did to Aiia Maarsawe, who is a complete stranger to him. Smash up Codey Hermann in jail. Stamp on his genitals &amp; kick him around for trying to be &#34;smart&#34;. Break his arms for those are the hands that killed Aiia Maarsawe for nothing.<br/>

All the crying, the sadness, the remorse etc. etc. will not bring Aya Maasawre back. She has gone from the world at age 21. Why ? Because of one Aboriginal pig who was trying to be smart. Codey Hermann has brought death to the Maasarwe family Because of his actions, Codey will have to pay with his blood. Not by Victorian law but by Islamic law. Codey will likely be tortured by Islam Palestinians. Its only a matter of time. Then, honesty will &#34;return&#34; to Codey Herman in his coffin ! The best way to stop killers is to either kill them or cut their arms off. Codey Hermann can do all the rapping, the Jack Daniels drinking, the dancing he wants. <br/>
But there is no escape for murder, especially for what he has done in Bundoora. Violent Aboriginals or any violent criminals are easily destroyed by the Indonesian Army, Hamas or Al Shabab.  Codey Herman/M.C. Cockhead has the intelligence level of a snail.</div>

Persistently violent men with criminal intent have to be taught the hard way. Jail is too soft as there are T.V., video arcades, snooker, movies etc. Jail is too comfortable. If such males refuse to learn, smashing them up physically is perhaps one way. Putting them in a pen with a pit bull or a rottweiler should also teach them. Indonesian police do torture hard core criminals &amp; its worse in Saudi Arabia. Going around murdering women has got to stop. If this continues, it will only get worse. Cody Herman has no fear of the police but he should fear Al Shabab ! The black arse rapper can rap up a tune in Arabic, dancing around at the same time, flapping his genitals ! The movie, Death Wish has the right approach for violent criminals. Charles Bronson blew up criminals like candles being snuffed out on a birthday cake !</div>

Cody Hermann, that self styled Aboriginal rapper is a total disgrace to Aboriginal Australia &amp; rightfully deserves to be blown up. Coming from a broken family background is no excuse to kill anyone. As Aiia Maasrwe is of Arab Irsaeli background, send Cody Hermann to Hamas or ISIS &amp; they will deal with him. Cody Hermann will be watched by those unseen, notably Hamas agents. They will lie in wait, as a saltwater croc waits for its chance. Cody will have his arms sawn off slowly but definitely. Cody Hermann is being watched since Aiia was murdered. Cody Herman will be rapping in his coffin.</div>

Next up was a 21 year old Israeli student gone. Where ? In Melbourne &amp; the police are still reading the papers &amp; watching TV ! Killers deserve to be shot at point blank range. The answer to all mentally deranged persons' issues is a forced conversion to Islam, which will set them straight. More &amp; more innocent victims are being taken in Melbourne recently &amp; if nothing is done, its just going to get from bad to worse.

Anglo-Celtic, African etc. etc. whatever. Troublemakers have to be physically flogged with steel/iron studded belts in public. Australia is a nation of peace &amp; if such men are bent on creating unnecessary trouble, ISIS methods are about the best for them otherwise everybody is going to live in fear of stepping outside &amp; going anywhere. Indonesian Police will smash these men up so hard that there will be no chance of re offending.<br/>
As Amran Syed Najib said, the Indonesian Army can re establish law &amp; order where the local police fail.<br/>
Injuring bystanders for the fun of it is a serious problem. Imagine if drunk violent men get their limbs blown off Hamas style. That would be funny ! Troublemakers &amp; offenders have to be dealt with especially when strangers get injured for nothing.</div>

The real crime problem in Melbourne are drunken Anglo-Celtic White men who get too drunk on weekends and become violent and abusive towards total strangers. It's a deep part of Australian culture, and nobody in Australia seems to see it as a problem. They love deflecting from themselves onto ethnic minorities ('African gangs')...</div>

African street gangs are slowly taking over Melbourne with individuals being injured or killed in the process.<br/>
The Victorian police appear weak in resolving these crimes. If the need arises to shoot violent criminals, just take aim &amp; fire like is done in North Korea. Get all criminal Africans born outside Australia out. Deport them once &amp; for all. It appears that only fire arms will stop such criminals. Or pay the Indonesian Army to come in &amp; finish the job !</div>

Violent home invasion thieves should be shot. Make no mistake about that. If a thief has to die, its his fault. He should just stop what he is doing and leave. No problem. If he does not, blow his head off ISIS style ! Anywhere where its easy picks, burglars will try their luck. Worst of all, they try to attack home residents. There should be no room for home invasions in any country. Australia is peaceful &amp; that is the way it should be. Violent home invasion burglars deserve to die.Or hack their limbs off as by Hudud law in Islam.</div>

That bastard who bashed &amp; sexually attacked a 22 year old woman in Melbourne 2013 should be looking over his shoulder for even worse that's coming to him. He will have a concentrated sulphuric acid &#34;shower&#34; at the end !<br/>
First will be the removal of his genitals, which will be forced down his throat. Next, his wrists will be completely broken. As he injured that woman in the head, he will have his head drilled. Next on the menu will be the breaking of his legs, followed by the sulfuric acid bath !</div>

Looks like everyone is going to live in fear of home invaders ! No such thing. Even if a violent thug has to be taught a lesson, just do it. Shoot him in his genitals. Smash his head up with a steel bar if he goes too far. And even break his legs really good and see if he will re offend ! One of the best confrontations a thief can have is with a Rottweiler, a German Shepherd or a Mastiff ! Let the dogs out and watch the show !

All the security cameras will not stop a determined burglar from breaking in. The best methods(employed in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia etc.) are to seriously injure an offender by bashing him up very hard and perhaps even breaking his arms &amp; legs. He is certain not to re offend after that ! That poor Queensland tradie(tradu) was bashed up by 13 people but that tradie caused no offence.

You guys are mad or what?! Is there really someone that considers Melbourne as a dangerous city??!? C'moooon.... It's a huge city, of course that there're robbery, violence, etc, etc, but even in the smallest village in the world you'll have it... <br/>
Melbourne's safe, brilliant and very special! Don't give your opinion if you have nothing to compare with...</div>

Most dangerous major city in Australia, crime rapidly increasing in recent years. Police take 1-3 hours to turn up in this place.</div>

Safe city, never felt threatened.. maybe a bit worried in the early hours of the morning at a nightclub or something. But, during the day - 100% safe. Stay out of suburbs such as Dandenong, Frankston, Broadmeadows, Coburg, etc.. and you'll be fine. Inner city and close suburbs are safe. Lived here for 5 years.</div>

I've lived in Melbourne my whole entire life and I find it quite safe, there are rarely crimes committed in the inner city as it is often crowded even in the middle of the night therefore criminals are too afraid to commit crimes as there would be many, many witnesses. Although there is quite a bit of petty crime in areas with less of a population. I will conclude by saying that Melbourne is safe as long as you stay in areas you're familiar with and areas that are well populated</div>

I've been living in Melbourne for 25 yrs and its a very safe city. The people are friendly and helpful. Like every city in the world there are occasional incidents that happen but I feel safe walking just about anywhere.</div>

Lived in Melbourne for 8 years including a stint in CBD. wanded around late at night many many nights including the red light district, caught last Train to suburbs and Never ever had any trouble or seen anything other than a few drunks you would see in any city. I feel completely safe in Melbourne. There is not a reason in the world to feel unsafe day or night. I feel safer in Melbourne than I do in my parents country hometown.</div>
