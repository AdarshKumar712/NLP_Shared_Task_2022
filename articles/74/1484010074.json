We have heard terms like the real-estate mafia,\" Vijayan said at the official launch event.\n\n\"It is the greed of a few that are spoiling the market. With the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) in place, there will be more transparency and credibility.

With an effective regulatory mechanism, the real estate sector is poised to grow more instilling confidence in home buyers,\" he said.\n\nPassed by the Parliament, the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, had directed the state governments to establish RERA for effective regulation of the real estate sector and also for speedy dispute redressal.\n\nAs per the Act, buildings with more than eight apartments and real estates projects with 500 square metres of land or more will have to be registered with RERA.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["kerala", "Pinarayi Vijayan", "real estate sector", "K-RERA"], "tags": ["Pinarayi Vijayan", "real estate sector", "K-RERA", "kerala"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Kerala Chief Minister further said that the real-estate sector has seen tremendous growth in the country in the last decade", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "kerala,Pinarayi Vijayan,real estate sector,K-RERA", "description": "Kerala Chief Minister further said that the real-estate sector has seen tremendous growth in the country in the last decade", "title": "'More transparency and credibility in real estate sector': Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan launches K-RERA", "keywords": "kerala,Pinarayi Vijayan,real estate sector,K-RERA", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/more-transparency-and-credibility-in-real-estate-sector-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-launches-k-rera", "title": "'More transparency and credibility in real estate sector': Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan launches K-RERA", "image": {"identifier": "https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2020-01%2F3cab227d-8b57-4c96-89c7-58adb295b3af%2FVijayan_jan1.jpg?rect=0%2C37%2C600%2C315&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "site_name": "Latest Indian news, Top Breaking headlines, Today Headlines, Top Stories at Free Press Journal"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'More transparency and credibility in real estate sector': Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan launches K-RERA", "image": "https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2020-01%2F3cab227d-8b57-4c96-89c7-58adb295b3af%2FVijayan_jan1.jpg?rect=0%2C25%2C600%2C338&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true", "creator": "Asia News International", "site": "Latest Indian news, Top Breaking headlines, Today Headlines, Top Stories at Free Press Journal", "domain": "https://www.freepressjournal.in"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2254637581419855, "pages": 178566438825717}, "viewport": "width=device-width,height=device-height,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=2.0,minimum-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/more-transparency-and-credibility-in-real-estate-sector-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-launches-k-rera"}
