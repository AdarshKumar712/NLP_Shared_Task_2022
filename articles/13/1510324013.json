Though, he reiterates it would still be quite a few years down the road before anything is built. Toews adds often it is easier to build brand new than to renovate an existing building because with a renovation you spend a lot of money but are still left with a building that does not fit the bill.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["steinbach", "online", "resources", "news", "manitoba", "town", "city", "news", "weather", "classifieds", "business", "jobs", "recipes", "events", "calendar", "agriculture", "sports"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Shannon Dueck"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan 30 17:12:46 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Steinbachonline.com is Steinbach's only source for community news and information such as weather and classifieds.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/templates/gantry/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "keywords": "steinbach, online, resources, news, manitoba, town, city, news, weather, classifieds, business, jobs, recipes, events, calendar, agriculture, sports", "author": "Shannon Dueck", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "url": "https://steinbachonline.com/local/hanover-contemplates-future-of-fire-hall-in-new-bothwell", "title": "Hanover Contemplates Future Of Fire Hall In New Bothwell - Steinbachonline.com", "description": "Steinbachonline.com is Steinbach&#039;s only source for community news and information such as weather and classifieds.", "image": "https://steinbachonline.com/images/stories/newsphotos/2020/01_January/2020_01_bothwell_hall.jpg"}, "description": "Steinbachonline.com is Steinbach's only source for community news and information such as weather and classifieds.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "fb": {"app_id": 1566330416959507, "admins": 563760633}, "og": {"title": "Hanover Contemplates Future Of Fire Hall In New Bothwell - Steinbachonline.com", "type": "article", "url": "https://steinbachonline.com/local/hanover-contemplates-future-of-fire-hall-in-new-bothwell", "site_name": "Steinbachonline.com", "description": "Steinbachonline.com is Steinbach's only source for community news and information such as weather and classifieds.", "image": "https://steinbachonline.com/images/stories/newsphotos/2020/01_January/2020_01_bothwell_hall.jpg"}, "\u201creferrer\u201d": "\u201corgin\u201d"}, "canonical_link": "https://steinbachonline.com/local/hanover-contemplates-future-of-fire-hall-in-new-bothwell"}
