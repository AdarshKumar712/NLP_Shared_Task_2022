We want good relations with all our partners. Naturally, they will be closer with the neighbors,\u201d the minister said.\n\nVladimir Makei gave such an answer when asked whether Belarus is going to develop relations with the USA to the detriment of cooperation with Russia. He also does not think that Belarus can be dragged into any sphere of influence. \u201cIt has always been and will stay here, in Europe, where there are big and smaller neighbors. Of course, we are subject to a certain influence of these countries. But it is absolutely impossible to say that Belarus could be moved to the American continent or that it could be more influenced by the United States. We will stay where we are,\u201d said the minister.\n\nVladimir Makei stressed that Belarus is ready to be friends with everyone, strengthen and develop traditionally friendly relations with Russia, and also with other important trade and economic partners, including the EU and the United States.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Feb 17 10:14:37 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "\"We want good relations with all our partners.
