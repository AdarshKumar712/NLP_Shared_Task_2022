The question 'log kya kahenge' haunts women the moment they even think of stepping into a liquor shop. Of course, the bucketload of judgement and the prying eyes of the shopkeeper himself are added bonuses. *smh*\n\nLiquor stores across the country may have moved from shady corners to upscale malls, but it\u2019s still not the most comfortable space for a woman to browse through aisles looking for that perfect drink. Raised eyebrows are the norm in most liquor stores when it comes to women stepping into them.\n\nSource/TOI\n\nTo see a woman asking a bottle of whiskey off the counter is a big shocker for people at the store. But it's 2020 for crying out loud and it's time to make peace with the fact that women also drink!\n\nIt seems like the government in Madhya Pradesh is paving the way forward for this progressive outlook. For the first time, the state is set to introduce women-friendly liquor shops in some cities to make women have a comfortable time liquor shopping, reports TOI.\n\nDon't Miss 52.7 K SHARES 18.6 K SHARES 8.1 K SHARES 14.5 K SHARES 6.6 K SHARES\n\nFacebook\n\nThe report states that two stores dedicated to women will be opened in Bhopal and Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur will have one women-friendly theka each.\n\nSpecial care will be taken to ensure that these outlets are stocked up with high-end foreign liquor brands that are loved by women. The local brands that are not registered with the state won\u2019t find a place in the store.\n\n\u201cNo additional duty would be claimed on these foreign liquor brands as they will be brought after paying the duty from other countries. These shops would open markets for the sale of expensive liquor in the state,\u201d a government official told TOI.\n\n\n\nThe shops would have foreign liquor brands that were previously never sold in the state. In order to generate revenue, and apart from this, the state will organise wine festivals in cities like Indore, Bhopal and Gwalior.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Women Friendly Thekas", "Women Liquor Shops.
