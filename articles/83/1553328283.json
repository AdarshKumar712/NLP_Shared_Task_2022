Cherokee County Sheriff David Groves tells News Talk KZRG the patient is a 52-year-old man that lives in the county. He is currently quarantined and has not been hospitalized.\n\nNo other identifying details are being released.\n\nSince receiving confirmation late Wednesday night, Cherokee County Health Department Officials have been in contact with the man and are diligently working to identify any recent close contacts the individual has had and those who may have been exposed will be contacted as soon as possible.\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, Cherokee County Officials with the Health Department, Office of Emergency Management, Sheriff\u2019s Office and other community leaders, including those in the medical field have been meeting and preparing for the continued spread of COVID-19 across the country.\n\nIn an effort to slow the spread of the virus, Cherokee County Health Department Administrator Betha Elliott continues to urge residents to frequently wash their hands with soap and warm water, refrain from touching their face and stay home if they are experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath.\n\nWhile the health department was on a conference call yesterday with Vice President Pence, he reiterated the unanimous opinion and advice from the nation\u2019s top health care professionals to stay home if at all possible over the next two weeks. By limiting face to face interactions with others the spread of the virus is projected to be reduced significantly.\n\nIf staying home is not an option, residents are encouraged to avoid large groups of people and avoid being within six feet of someone for a period longer than ten minutes.\n\nAnyone experiencing symptoms of a fever greater than 100.4 degrees (F), a cough and shortness of breath are encouraged to call their medical provider. By calling ahead, you avoid putting other patients and medical staff at risk. They will be able to provide instructions and make preparations prior to your arrival. Under guidance from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, those who are exhibiting the symptoms previously described, will first be tested for Influenza A and B, prior COVID-19 meeting the criteria to be tested for COVID-19.\n\nThe Kansas Department of Health and Environment has set up a hotline for anyone with COVID-19 related questions. It can be reached at 1-866-534-3463. I also encourage residents to go to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment website kdheks.gov/coronavirus/COVID-19 for a wide range of related information.
