minute-by-minute coverage of her new romance with Cody Simpson.\n\nMiley Cyrus\u2019 boyfriend Cody Simpson has brushed off reports he was flirting with girls \u2013 even giving one a no-tongue smooch \u2013 at New York\u2019s Little Sister lounge right before Christmas, telling Page Six it\u2019s all \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\nDespite the alleged Christmas canoodle with Playboy\u2019s December 2019 playmate Jordy Murray, 26, the singer spent the holiday with Cyrus and her family in Tennessee.\n\nRELATED: Cody Simpson\u2019s sister slams rumours he and Miley have split\n\nRELATED: Cody Simpson opens up about relationship with Miley Cyrus\n\n\u201cIt was a great Christmas out in Nashville,\u201d he told the publication, saying that he and Cyrus were \u201cgreat\u201d and that reports of his flirting are \u201cstupid\u201d.\n\nThe comments come after Simpson\u2019s sister Ali also slammed rumours of a split.\n\n\u201cYes, (they\u2019re) together for sure,\u201d Alli Simpson told Daily Maillast month.\n\nSpeculation a split was brewing between Simpson and Cyrus, 27, reached critical mass after fans noticed the couple\u2019s relative absence from social media in recent weeks.\n\nThough the pop star pair were last seen together at a Los Angeles charity function in early December, the two hadn\u2019t traded social media posts or commented on each other\u2019s posts despite still following each other.\n\nFurther questions were raised when Cyrus tweeted a series of messages about being \u201clonely\u201d during the most wonderful time of the year and shared a new record titled My Sad Christmas Song.\n\n\u201cA sad Christmas song I wrote a few years back right before the holidays. Was feeling like sh*t cause I couldn\u2019t be with the one I loved. Even with a house full of family and friends I still felt alone \u2026,\u201d Cyrus wrote, linking her new song on the message.\n\n\u201cIn ways that still feels relevant and someone reading this right now could possibly relate! If you feel lonely this season just know YOU ARE COMPLETELY MADE OF MAGIC! You are as special as a snowflake, beautifully unique and I hope inside your soul feels light, hope, peace and joy knowing how singularly amazing YOU are! Love always wins!\u201d she added.\n\nMeanwhile, Cyrus\u2019 ex-husband Liam Hemsworth was recently spotted in Australia, where he appeared to introduce his parents to rumoured new girlfriend, model Gabriella Brooks.\n\nCyrus continues to appear bitter about her divorce, as she recently joked to a fan who was vocal about tying the knot with her that it \u201cprobably won\u2019t last long\u201d.\n\nT his article originally appeared on Page Six and was reproduced with permission", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["social media", "Aussie singer", "social media posts", "pop star pair", "charity function", "Celebrity life", "New York", "United States of America", "Northern America", "North America", "America", "Los Angeles", "California", "Tennessee", "Nashville", "Australia", "Australia and New Zealand", "Oceania", "Daily Mail", "Cody Simpson", "Jordy Murray", "Miley Cyrus", "Ali"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Mara Siegler"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 03:32:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Miley Cyrus\u2019 boyfriend Cody Simpson has brushed off reports he was flirting with girls \u2013 even giving one a no-tongue smooch \u2013 at New York\u2019s Little Sister lounge right before Christmas, telling Page Six it\u2019s all \u201cstupid.\u201d", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "tcog", "articleid": "6dd799fee6437837e7db32ce1e8a0734", "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-02T03:32:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T03:56:09.000Z", "publisher": "News Limited", "author": "Mara Siegler", "publicationdate": "02/01/2020"}, "description": "Miley Cyrus\u2019 boyfriend Cody Simpson has brushed off reports he was flirting with girls \u2013 even giving one a no-tongue smooch \u2013 at New York\u2019s Little Sister lounge right before Christmas, telling Page Six it\u2019s all \u201cstupid.\u201d", "keywords": "social media,Aussie singer,social media posts,pop star pair,charity function,Celebrity life,New York,United States of America,Northern America,North America,America,Los Angeles,California,Tennessee,Nashville,Australia,Australia and New Zealand,Oceania,Daily Mail,Cody Simpson,Jordy Murray,Miley Cyrus,Ali", "og": {"image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1e23a0706dd1418197aa94a501557a30?width=650", "title": "Cody Simpson responds to rumours he and Miley Cyrus have split", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/hook-ups-break-ups/cody-simpson-responds-to-rumours-he-and-miley-cyrus-have-split/news-story/6dd799fee6437837e7db32ce1e8a0734", "site_name": "NewsComAu", "description": "Miley Cyrus\u2019 boyfriend Cody Simpson has brushed off reports he was flirting with girls \u2013 even giving one a no-tongue smooch \u2013 at New York\u2019s Little Sister lounge right before Christmas, telling Page Six it\u2019s all \u201cstupid.\u201d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113758722003364, "admins": "1533025129,653135158,737988273"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newscomauHQ", "title": "Cody Simpson responds to rumours he and Miley Cyrus have split"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "news.com.au", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "application-name": "news.com.au", "referrer": "origin", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/hook-ups-break-ups/cody-simpson-responds-to-rumours-he-and-miley-cyrus-have-split/news-story/6dd799fee6437837e7db32ce1e8a0734"}
