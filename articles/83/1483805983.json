Officials said the deaths were not caused by disease.\n\nBill Vaughn, owner of Coastal Seatrucking, said the contents of the trailer were being pumped out Tuesday so the trailer could be removed from the water.\n\nFish farms are responsible for making sure carcasses are securely transferred to land, and officials said they will be checking to make sure proper procedures were followed.\n\n\"DFO is looking into this incident to determine if any licence conditions have been breached,\" the department's spokesperson said.\n\nThe incident follows less than two weeks after some 21,000 non-native salmon escaped into B.C. waters from a fish farm owned by Mowi Canada West.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Surrey", "Burnaby", "Metro Vancouver", "Fraser Valley", "North Shore", "Coquitlam", "Richmond", "Tri-Cities", "Delta", "Langley", "news", "Vancouver news", "CTV News", "CTV BC", "CTVBC", "BCTV news", "news Vancouver", "CTV Morning Live"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 12:56:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Heavy waves are being blamed for sending a tank trailer full of dead fish plummeting into the water off the coast of Vancouver Island last weekend.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//static.ctvnews.ca/bellmedia/ctvnews/img/fav-icons-2019/57x57-CTVNews-Icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Heavy waves are being blamed for sending a tank trailer full of dead fish plummeting into the water off the coast of Vancouver Island last weekend.", "keywords": "Surrey, Burnaby, Metro Vancouver, Fraser Valley, North Shore, Coquitlam, Richmond, Tri-Cities, Delta, Langley, news, Vancouver news, CTV News, CTV BC, CTVBC, BCTV news, news Vancouver, CTV Morning Live", "news_keywords": "fish farm, atlantic salmon, tanker trailer, fisheries and oceans", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "fb": {"pages": 174761742563060, "admins": "ctvbcnews"}, "dc.date.modified": "2019-12-31", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "'Heavy wave action' caused tank trailer to roll off vessel in B.C. waters, officials say", "description": "Heavy waves are being blamed for sending a tank trailer full of dead fish plummeting into the water off the coast of Vancouver Island last weekend.", "url": "https://bc.ctvnews.ca/heavy-wave-action-caused-tank-trailer-to-roll-off-vessel-in-b-c-waters-officials-say-1.4749109", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4748181.1577756339!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpeg", "site_name": "British Columbia", "locale": "en_CA"}, "twitter": {"title": "'Heavy wave action' caused tank trailer to roll off vessel in B.C. waters, officials say", "url": "https://bc.ctvnews.ca/heavy-wave-action-caused-tank-trailer-to-roll-off-vessel-in-b-c-waters-officials-say-1.4749109", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Heavy waves are being blamed for sending a tank trailer full of dead fish plummeting into the water off the coast of Vancouver Island last weekend.", "site": "@CTVVancouver", "creator": "@CTVVancouver", "image": {"src": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4748181.1577756339!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2019-12-31T12:56:00-08:00", "modified_time": "2019-12-31T13:53:00-08:00"}}, "canonical_link": "https://bc.ctvnews.ca/heavy-wave-action-caused-tank-trailer-to-roll-off-vessel-in-b-c-waters-officials-say-1.4749109"}
