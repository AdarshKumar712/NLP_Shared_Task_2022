It was Lee's grandfather, a 30-year Island resident, who first had the idea that Lee should open an adult arcade in this location.\n\n\"I've had positive experiences with adult gaming,\" said Lee. \"It gives people a chance to get out and do something fun. It's geared toward people looking for a night out, with maybe a chance to meet new friends.\"\n\nLee said more than anything he wants to offer people a chance to socialize in an environment that benefits everyone in the community.\n\nArticle Photos The interior of Lucky Eddie\u2019s Social Center.\n\n\n\nPAULETTE LEBLANC\n\nIn addition to having food and drinks brought in from local restaurants at no charge to his gamers, he also plans to hand out winning gift certificates from surrounding businesses, in an effort to support local revenue.\n\n\"I put this place here for people to have fun. Once you get to know Benji and me, it's pretty easy to figure out that I'm here to build relationships and friendships. I'd like to do pizza night on Fridays; a ladies night, where women spend $20 and get an extra $10 to play with. I'd also like to do something to honor veterans. If I can bring people together who didn't know each other, that's what I want to do. If I can keep people from having to drive far away to have a good time, I'd like to do that too,\" said Lee.\n\nLucky Eddie's is located at 10700 Stringfellow Road, Bokeelia, FL 33922.
