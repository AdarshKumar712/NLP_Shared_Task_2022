A video of the incident went viral on Twitter.\n\nReciting the midday Angelus prayer Jan. 1, Pope Francis was talking about how God\u2019s offer of salvation in Jesus is \u201cnot magic, but patient, that is, it involves the patience of love, which takes on inequity and destroys its power.\u201d\n\nThen, briefly departing from his prepared text, the pope said that \u201clove makes us patient. We often lose our patience; me, too, and I apologize for my bad example last night.\u201d\n\nReturning to his text, Pope Francis said that in gazing upon the Nativity scene with the eyes of faith, \u201cwe see the world renewed, freed from the dominion of evil and placed under the regal lordship of Christ, the baby lying in the manger.\u201d\n\nThe church marks Jan. 1 as both the feast of Mary, Mother of God, and World Peace Day, he said, urging Catholics to pray for peace and to recognize their responsibility to work for peace.\n\nFor the 2020 celebration of World Peace Day, he said, the focus was on peace as a \u201cjourney of hope, a journey which proceeds through dialogue, reconciliation and ecological conversion.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus is the blessing of those oppressed by the yoke of slavery, both moral and material,\u201d he said. \u201cHe frees with love.\u201d\n\nTo those who are enslaved by vice and addiction, the pope said, Jesus bears the message that \u201cthe Father loves you, he will not abandon you, with unshakable patience he awaits your return.\u201d\n\nJesus opens the doors of fraternity, welcome and love to those who are victims of injustice or exploitation; pours \u201cthe oil of consolation\u201d on the sick and the discouraged; and opens windows of light for prisoners who feel they have no future, he said.\n\n\u201cDear brothers and sisters,\u201d he told the people in the square, \u201clet\u2019s get down from the pedestals of our pride and ask for the blessing of the holy Mother of God. She will show us Jesus. Let\u2019s let ourselves be blessed, let\u2019s open our hearts to goodness and that way the year that is beginning will be a journey of hope and peace, not through words, but through daily gestures of dialogue, reconciliation and care for creation.\u201d\n\nPope Francis used his midday address to thank and encourage all the initiatives Catholics, their parishes and dioceses around the world undertake to promote peace.\n\n\u201cMy thoughts also go to the many volunteers who, in places where peace and justice are threatened, courageously choose to be present in a nonviolence and unarmed way, as well as to the military who carry out peacekeeping missions in many areas of conflict,\u201d the pope said.\n\nAddressing everyone, \u201cbelievers and non-believers because we are all brothers and sisters,\u201d Pope Francis urged people to \u201cnever stop hoping in a world of peace,\u201d which must be built together, day by day.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["new year's day", "pope francis", "Pope Francis Angelus January 1", "Pope Francis January 1", "Pope Francis slaps woman's hand", "Solemnity of Mary the Mother of God"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cindy Wooden", "Catholic News Service", "Posted January"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"keywords": "new year's day, pope francis, Pope Francis Angelus January 1, Pope Francis January 1, Pope Francis slaps woman's hand, Solemnity of Mary the Mother of God", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "fb": {"pages": 108085326801}, "google-site-verification": "A8iklSxbt_qyO7YOXnA75o6KISmvf7AgYpV403xWCDI", "robots": "index,follow", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"title": "Pope begins New Year with apology, prayers for peace", "description": "At his Jan. 1 Angelus address, Pope Francis said he regretted his", "type": "article", "url": "https://catholicphilly.com/2020/01/news/world-news/pope-begins-new-year-with-apology-prayers-for-peace/", "site_name": "Catholic Philly", "image": "https://catholicphilly.com/media-files/2020/01/20200101T0743-0461-CNS-POPE-ANGELUS-PEACE-796x448.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CatholicPhilly", "title": "Pope begins New Year with apology, prayers for peace", "description": "At his Jan. 1 Angelus address, Pope Francis said he regretted his", "image": "https://catholicphilly.com/media-files/2020/01/20200101T0743-0461-CNS-POPE-ANGELUS-PEACE-796x448.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://catholicphilly.com/media-files/2016/05/cropped-cplogo-fav-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://catholicphilly.com/2020/01/news/world-news/pope-begins-new-year-with-apology-prayers-for-peace/"}
