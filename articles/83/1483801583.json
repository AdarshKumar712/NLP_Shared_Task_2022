Plastic bags cannot be recycled.\n\nAlthough cities, counties, Metro regional government and garbage haulers have all publicized this information, plastic bags and plastic wrap that goes around toilet paper packages and the like continue to end up in recycle bins.\n\n\"Plastic bags have never been part of curbside recycling, but they have been the biggest problem at the (recycling) plants,\" said Shannon Martin, program manager, recycling and solid waste, for the city of Gresham.\n\nThe bags and wrap get tangled up in the machinery and the machines have to be shut down while the bags are extracted. It slows things down and raises the cost of recycling.\n\nAs much as people want to recycle plastic bags, they go in the trash.\n\n\"People want to do the right thing,\" said Patrick Morgan, recycling specialist, at Metro regional government. \"But they run the risk of contaminating the rest of the recycle. It's more important to recycle correctly than recycle a lot.\"\n\nOf course, taking a reusable bag to the store or for take out food, can reduce the number of plastic bags households end up with in the first place.\n\nRecycling can be confusing. It seems odd that a cereal box, milk carton and aseptic soup and juice cartons can be recycled, but not the box that housed frozen mac and cheese.\n\nTo help the public figure out what can go in the recycle bin and what has to be tossed in the garbage, Metro and local governments have launched a web page, recycleornot.org, to help answer questions about what can be recycled, even with the most baffling items.\n\nThere is also an Instagram page @recycleornot where people can send photos and questions on specific items.\n\nThe web page divides items by materials: plastic paper, glass and metal and \"other.\" People can scroll through the examples that are clearly marked \"recyclable\" or \"not recyclable.\"\n\nOther items that cannot be recycled, but often end up in the recycle bin, are take out and to-go containers, plastic clamshells and coffee and drink cups. Lids for plastic cups and condiment packets are also garbage.\n\nRepublic Services in Woodburn, which serves north Marion County, also provides a website to clarify recycling: recyclingsimplified.com.\n\nGresham's Martin said that just because the little recycle arrows are on the bottom of a container does not mean it belongs in the curbside recycle.\n\nBatteries cannot be recycled or put in the trash. The Metro web page can help people find a place to take toxic materials at: oregonmetro.gov/tools-living/garbage-and-recycling/find-a-recycler.\n\nHoliday recycling\n\nChristmas and Hanukkah gifts can produce mountains of debris, some can be recycled and a much of it has to go in the garbage.\n\nWrapping paper that does not have glitter or foil on it can go in the recycling.\n\n\"A little bit of tape is OK,\" Morgan said.\n\nHoliday lights cannot be recycled. Bows, ribbon and broken glass ornaments are also a no go.\n\nCards with those tiny batteries that sing or say something cannot be recycled, unless the battery is removed. The batteries are causing fires in the recycling plants.\n\nThose big blocks of styrofoam that cushion many gifts can't go into the curbside recycle bin. Gresham accepts it at Earth Day events.\n\nSaid Martin: \"Oregonians have a deep commitment to the environment and recycling is very important. We're encouraging people to check the list and do it right.\" '", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["topics: Environment", "socialTag: Articles", "Waste management", "Nature", "Water conservation", "Mass production", "Shopping bags", "Bags", "Plastic bag", "Recycling", "Kerbside collection", "Waste container", "Reusable shopping bag", "entities: Patrick Morgan", "metal", "machinery", "Instagram", "shannon martin", "Shannon Martin", "Metro", "program manager", "food", "Gresham", ""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Teresa Carson"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Hey, can I recycle this? , Local News, Woodburn local News, Breaking News alerts for Woodburn city.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "topics: Environment, socialTag: Articles, Waste management, Nature, Water conservation, Mass production, Shopping bags, Bags, Plastic bag, Recycling, Kerbside collection, Waste container, Reusable shopping bag, entities: Patrick Morgan, metal, machinery, Instagram, shannon martin, Shannon Martin, Metro, program manager, food, Gresham,", "rights": "Pamplin Communications Corporation", "author": "Teresa Carson", "description": "Hey, can I recycle this? , Local News, Woodburn local News, Breaking News alerts for Woodburn city.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "fb": {"app_id": 384172401695810}, "og": {"url": "https://pamplinmedia.com/wbi/152-news/446714-362869-hey-can-i-recycle-this-", "type": "article", "title": "Hey, can I recycle this?", "image": "https://pamplinmedia.com/images/artimg/00003659525113-0788.jpg", "site_name": "https://joomlakave.com", "description": "Metro and cities launch website on what to throw in the trash and what can be recycled"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ThePortlandTrib", "title": "Hey, can I recycle this?", "description": "Metro and cities launch website on what to throw in the trash and what can be recycled", "image": "https://pamplinmedia.com/images/artimg/00003659525113-0788.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://pamplinmedia.com/wbi/152-news/446714-362869-hey-can-i-recycle-this-"}
