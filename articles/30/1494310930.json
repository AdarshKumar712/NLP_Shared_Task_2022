You would swear, too, if you had to play the same terrifying game Selena was forced to.\n\nIt\u2019s late night show protocol to not swear on television (or at least, try avoid to), a rule that Selena Gomez just broke! The 27-year-old singer had good reason to, though, on the Jan. 13 episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon \u2014 she was attacked by a stuffed animal. Okay, let\u2019s backup: Selena was competing against host Jimmy Fallon, 45, in a game of Can You Feel It? As the name suggests, Selena and Jimmy were forced to touch not exactly pleasant objects (and organisms) in a glass box and take wild guesses at what they were probing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the wet shower drain hair or LIVE mealworms that made Selena scream a word that wasn\u2019t PG-friendly. That honor went to a toy bear that suddenly transformed into an evil puppet, which tried to \u201cbite\u201d Selena\u2019s hand! \u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW WHAT THE F\u2013K,\u201d Selena exclaimed, after incorrectly guessing the mystery item was her dog. Immediately realizing what she just said, Selena clutched her mouth, and later couldn\u2019t stop apologizing: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m sorry!\u201d No need to be sorry, Selena.\n\nAfter Selena and Jimmy properly sanitized their hands, the discussion moved on to Selena\u2019s new album, Rare, once she sat down for her interview with Jimmy. It turns out that \u201cmaybe there\u2019s a few things\u201d that didn\u2019t make the cut for the final track list, including a song called \u201cBoyfriend.\u201d But the song won\u2019t be stuck in Selena\u2019s computer! \u201cI can\u2019t wait for people to hear that one,\u201d Selena gushed, confirming that the song will one day make its public debut, after an unreleased track originally called \u201cI Want a Boyfriend\u201d was teased in Selena\u2019s Jan. 2020 profile for Wall Street Journal.\n\nEven while playing with mealworms, Selena still managed to look absolutely fabulous. She paid tribute to the \u201960s with her flippy half-up, half-down hairdo, flirty fringe and cat eye, the same hairstyle the singer wore as she later headed to Nobu in New York City after taping The Tonight Show. However, she moved onto the next decade \u2014 the groovy \u201970s \u2014 by changing out of her pink Miu Miu dress and Prada heels to instead wear flare jeans, a cream sweater and crocodile print booties for her sushi dinner.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Diet", "Makeover", "Celeb Galleries", "Portrait Series", "Bonnie Says", "Fitness", "The Bachelor", "The Tonight Show", "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", "Oscar Contenders"], "authors": ["Jade Boren", "Kenzie Mastroe", "Mia Maguire", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Ryan Reed", "Ryan Lattanzio", "Evening Writer"], "publish_date": "Tue Jan 14 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Oops!
