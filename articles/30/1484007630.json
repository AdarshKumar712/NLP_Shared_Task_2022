(Sophie Heizer/News Staff)\n\nFreshly elected first-time Saanich Community Association Network (SCAN) Chair Don Gunn said the hub for local community groups will tackle the issue of housing in the new year.\n\nGunn and Vice-Chair Eric Dahli were elected to chair the network of associations on Dec. 4. They will chair the network into the new year. They said Saanich Mayor Fred Haynes is scheduled to speak to the group about the direction they\u2019re going in March 2020.\n\n\u201cSome of the things we\u2019re going to be looking at include how we handle developments, affordable housing and how it impacts communities, infill housing, garden suites, and looking at using institutional land for housing,\u201d Gunn said.\n\nGunn said densifying housing in the area is inevitable. \u201cWe\u2019re going to densify, it\u2019s just a matter of trying to maintain the character of the community at the same time,\u201d Gunn said.\n\nDahli and Gunn said they\u2019d like to see the associations attract more young people. They encourage people, especially young people, to get involved with their local community association.\n\n\u201cThe majority of our members are retired, which is great because they bring a lot of experience, but we need more young people,\u201d Gunn said.\n\n\u201cAll the associations try to attract new and younger members. We aim for a balance, and a gender balance, because we want to reflect the community,\u201d Dahli said.\n\n\u201cEach community association is a voice unto itself, we don\u2019t speak for all the associations and we have no statutory power, we\u2019re really about sharing information between the associations and we liaise with the Victoria Community Association Network too,\u201d Dahli said. \u201cThe nice thing about us is we\u2019re recognized by Saanich Council and they give us some funding, which is non-existent elsewhere.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Saanich\u2019s community associations, visit saanich.ca/EN/main/community/community-associations.html.\n\nsophie.heizer@saanichnews.com", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["55+ BC Game", "B.C.
