From there, the deficit ballooned to six as Fairfield scored four runs on five hits and a North Carolina error in the top of the fifth to make it 8-2.\n\nIn the top of the seventh, Fairfield scored another three for a hefty 11-2 lead, which was the eventual final.\n\nIn the finale on Sunday, North Carolina scored three in the top of the third inning against UNCG thanks to a two-run homer from senior Campbell Hutcherson and a solo home run from sophomore Lexi Godwin.\n\nUNCG scored a run in the bottom of the fourth and added three more \u2014 on three straight solo homers \u2014 in the fifth to take a 4-3 lead. Hutcherson responded with a double to send in another two runs to retake a one-run lead.\n\nIn the bottom of the sixth with a 2-2 count, though, UNCG hit a grand slam to shift momentum and take a three-run lead. North Carolina couldn\u2019t respond in the top of the seventh inning and fell in heartbreaking fashion, 8-5.\n\nWho stood out?\n\nGeorge pitched an impressive game one and kept the Tar Heels in it, while Godwin had a 2-3 day at the plate despite the loss.\n\nSophomore Abby Settlemyre went 3-4 with a double and two runs scored in the finale against UNCG, while Hutcherson went 2-4 with four RBIs.\n\nWhen was it decided?\n\nThe first game against Purdue was tied at zero until the bottom of the sixth when Purdue finally broke through. North Carolina batted in the top of the seventh but was unable to tie the game up and suffered a 1-0 loss.\n\nAgainst Fairfield, at the top of the fourth inning North Carolina was only down 4-2. But the fifth inning proved disastrous for UNC as Fairfield scored four runs and pushed their lead to 8-2, and another three in the top of the seventh to make it 11-2.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nHead coach Donna J. Papa said her team wasn't consistent in some respects, but believes it made strides toward getting better. She felt the team had a chance to come away with a perfect 3-0 weekend.\n\n\u201cVery disappointing, because we went into that tournament knowing the competition \u2014 definitely I felt like we would come out of there 3-0, and we came out 0-3,\u201d Papa said. \"That\u2019s just not something I\u2019m used to and our program is used to, and we have to get better.\u201d\n\nWhen do they play next?\n\nUNC hosts Elon on Wednesday at 4 p.m.\n\n@A_ReynoldsDTH\n\n@DTHSports | sports@dailytarheel.com", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The North Carolina softball team competed in the weekend-long UNC Greensboro tournament and was defeated in all three games it played, losing to Purdue, Fairfield and UNCG by a combined 13 runs.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://d39xfl750sfsi8.cloudfront.net/96c3e7162d60df704c94be325f3f1be4/dist/img/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The North Carolina softball team competed in the weekend-long UNC Greensboro tournament and was defeated in all three games it played, losing to Purdue, Fairfield and UNCG by a combined 13 runs.", "fb": {"app_id": 386215825139752}, "twitter": {"site": "@dailytarheel", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"url": "https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2020/02/unc-softball-uncg-tournament", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Daily Tar Heel", "title": "UNC softball swept in three-game UNCG tournament this weekend", "description": "The North Carolina softball team competed in the weekend-long UNC Greensboro tournament and was defeated in all three games it played, losing to Purdue, Fairfield and UNCG by a combined 13 runs.", "image": {"identifier": "https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dth/0cd9a6ce-c292-41fc-b0a4-a1cbc7508fed.sized-1000x1000.JPG?w=800&h=600", "width": 800, "height": 600}}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "google-site-verification": "CHlXbXA4sWralvQUEv7pJfpAAlXw8V34QT7XXWre_aU"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2020/02/unc-softball-uncg-tournament"}
