Because heaters aren\u2019t good for deer, hence paddy straw is being kept,\" said Praveen, animal keeper in-charge of the zoo, news agency ANI reported.\n\nThe temperature dipped to 12 degree Celsius in Assam in December. As per the Regional Meteorological Centre data, the maximum temperature was recorded at 23 degree Celsius on December 23.\n\nThe Nehru Zoological Park, situated in Hyderdabad, also made special arrangements for animals to beat the cold this December. The zoo administration placed heaters in all the night houses of tigers, lions, cheetah, jaguar, leopard.\n\nThe Nehru Zoological Park also put in place gunny bags to prevent chilly air from entering the enclosures of the animals. In view of the dropping temperature, wooden planks were placed to avoid cramps in their feet.\n\nBesides, the administration arranged for nest boxes in night houses of birds, particularly macaws and cockatoos.\n\nGet the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.
