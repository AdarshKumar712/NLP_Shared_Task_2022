He was captured by New York City police around midnight in the 32nd Precinct in Harlem, said Ramapo Police Chief Bill Weidel.\n\nFive victims were rushed to local hospitals; two of them were in critical condition, according to the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council. One victim was reportedly stabbed at least six times.\n\nAt 9:50 this eve, a call came in about a mass stabbing at 47 Forshay Road in Monsey (Rockland County; 30 miles North of NYC). It's the house of a Hasidic Rabbi. 5 patients with stab wounds, all Hasidic, were transported to local hospitals. \u2014 OJPAC Hudson Valley (@OJPACHV) December 29, 2019\n\nUS: Clip, Several Orthodox Jews stabbed in Monsey, NY, injuries reported, emergency personnel responding, motive unknown at this time pic.twitter.com/dsO786jPlT \u2014 Yiddish News (@YiddishNews) December 29, 2019\n\nThe motive for the attack was still unknown late Saturday.
