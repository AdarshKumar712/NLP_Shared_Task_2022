have been reflecting on their last 10 years and what lies ahead in 2020.\n\nEast Belfast woman Maxine Mawhinney (62) is one of the best-known journalists of our time, and as a BBC News anchorwoman delivered the news that Princess Diana had died.\n\nThe mum of two daughters and three grandchildren says she has had a \"lively\" decade and is looking forward to the next one.\n\n\"It has been a really busy decade for me,\" she said. \"I celebrated 40 years in journalism. I left the BBC after 21 years.\n\n\"I got married. I got breast cancer and my daughter produced my three grandchildren. So personally and professionally it was quite the decade.\n\n\"It's also been the start of a new career speaking, hosting and writing. I've joined the senior faculty of the Karolinska Institutet University in Stockholm where I lecture in communications. I'm writing a fiction novel. I also turned 60 but as it's the new 40, I'm not slowing down at all,\" she said.\n\n\"Looking ahead, in 2020 I want to spend more time in Northern Ireland with my family and also bring friends there to show them all the fabulous things on offer.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["belfasttelegraph"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "From health battles, expanding families and political woes, well-known Northern Ireland faces have been reflecting on their last 10 years and what lies ahead in 2020.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn-02.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/static/65878e062b4890b48f61c325264e809c8a5eee53/img/favicon-belfasttelegraph.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "belfasttelegraph", "description": "From health battles, expanding families and political woes, well-known Northern Ireland faces have been reflecting on their last 10 years and what lies ahead in 2020.", "news_keywords": "We've faced challenges over past decade: Famous Northern Ireland faces high hopes for 2020 - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk", "og": {"title": "We've faced challenges over past decade: Famous Northern Ireland faces high hopes for 2020 - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk", "site_name": "BelfastTelegraph.co.uk", "description": "From health battles, expanding families and political woes, well-known Northern Ireland faces have been reflecting on their last 10 years and what lies ahead in 2020.", "url": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/weve-faced-challenges-over-past-decade-famous-northern-ireland-faces-high-hopes-for-2020-38825501.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/c93c1/38825497.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/2020-01-01_new_55986657_I1.JPG", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 342, "height": 342}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@BelTel", "url": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/weve-faced-challenges-over-past-decade-famous-northern-ireland-faces-high-hopes-for-2020-38825501.html", "title": "We've faced challenges over past decade: Famous Northern Ireland faces high hopes for 2020", "description": "From health battles, expanding families and political woes, well-known Northern Ireland faces have been reflecting on their last 10 years and what lies ahead in 2020.", "image": {"src": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/c93c1/38825497.ece/ALTERNATES/w135square/2020-01-01_new_55986657_I1.JPG"}, "domain": "BelfastTelegraph.co.uk"}, "published-date": "Wed, 01 Jan 2020 07:00:00 GMT", "fb": {"app_id": 321217294648139}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1229633020, app-argument=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/weve-faced-challenges-over-past-decade-famous-northern-ireland-faces-high-hopes-for-2020-38825501.html"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/weve-faced-challenges-over-past-decade-famous-northern-ireland-faces-high-hopes-for-2020-38825501.html"}
