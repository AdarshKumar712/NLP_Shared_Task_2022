This rain is not ordinary rain,\u201d the agency wrote in a statement.\n\nRead also: Multiple deaths reported as floods, landslide strike Greater Jakarta\n\nThe BMKG said the nearly record-high rainfall intensity was due to several factors, including the occurrence of a monsoon. According to the United Kingdom\u2019s Met Office, a monsoon climate is characterized by \u201ca dramatic seasonal change in direction of the prevailing winds of a region which brings a marked change in rainfall\u201d.\n\n\u201cWind moving from the northeast of Java Island met with another wind blowing from the south of the island. Such an encounter has led to the massive formation of clouds in the sky above Java Island,\u201d the head of the BMKG\u2019s public meteorology center, Fachri Radjab, said in a video uploaded by the agency\u2019s official YouTube account.\n\nHe added the weather conditions had been worsened by a high amount of water vapor caused by the high temperatures of the Indian Ocean, especially in areas south of Java Island. \u201cThe water vapor later affected cloud formations over Java,\u201d Fachri said.\n\nThe BMKG predicted heavy rain to continue in Greater Jakarta until Saturday as a result of the atmospheric conditions.
