The student union has denied these allegations, blaming leftwing groups for the violence.\n\nPictures circulating online showing Padukone standing behind an injured student leader, whose head was covered in a bandage, appeared on social media, raising calls for a boycott of her film Chhapaak (Splash), which is due to be released on Friday.\n\n\u201c#BoycottChhapaak\u201d was Twitter\u2019s top trending topic in India on Wednesday, with more than 350,000 tweets on the subject. The film is based on the true story of a woman who survived an acid attack and rebuilt her life.\n\n\u201cWhat a brazen & cheap tactic to promote a film!\u201d wrote one Twitter user about Padukone, while another added: \u201cShe chooses JNU where leftists who want to break India dominate!\u201d\n\nSome Bollywood figures lauded Padukone, and vowed to support the film. \u201cLet\u2019s all those who stand against the violence go to @bookmyshow and show them,\u201d tweeted the actor and filmmaker Anurag Kashyap.\n\nPadukone, who starred in the 2017 action film xXx: Return of Xander Cage with Vin Diesel, did not appear to have made any statement on Tuesday. She was not available for comment on Wednesday, her spokeswoman said.\n\nThe protests sweeping India in recent weeks have posed a dilemma for Bollywood, which has some big-name Muslim actors but is sensitive to the sentiments of the country\u2019s Hindu majority.\n\n\u201cThe reason why a whole lot of stars back away from making statements is because they are afraid of the consequences it will have on their films,\u201d said the brand consultant and columnist Santosh Desai. \u201cTo do this so close to a film is certainly risky.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["India", "Protest", "Students", "World news", "South and Central Asia"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  8 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Deepika Padukone visits students at Delhi university after campus attack injures 30", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/fee5e2d638d1c35f6d501fa397e53329/152x152.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Deepika Padukone visits students at Delhi university after campus attack injures 30", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc86767e2db999080f8238fa92af193a67dc257/0_64_4194_2517/master/4194.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15e2327a57b9b16ae61303fe2cd0ec05", "keywords": "India,Protest,Students,World news,South and Central Asia", "news_keywords": "India,Protest,Students,World news,South and Central Asia", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/deepika-padukone-bollywood-actor-faces-boycott-calls-after-joining-student-protest", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc86767e2db999080f8238fa92af193a67dc257/0_64_4194_2517/master/4194.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5d027c0593c23c482738fc3afabefc53", "description": "Deepika Padukone visits students at Delhi university after campus attack injures 30", "type": "article", "title": "Bollywood actor faces boycott calls after joining student protest", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "Reuters", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "World news", "published_time": "2020-01-08T15:05:00.000Z", "tag": "India,Protest,Students,World news,South and Central Asia", "modified_time": "2020-01-08T15:45:34.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/08/deepika-padukone-bollywood-actor-faces-boycott-calls-after-joining-student-protest?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/08/deepika-padukone-bollywood-actor-faces-boycott-calls-after-joining-student-protest?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/deepika-padukone-bollywood-actor-faces-boycott-calls-after-joining-student-protest", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/08/deepika-padukone-bollywood-actor-faces-boycott-calls-after-joining-student-protest?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc86767e2db999080f8238fa92af193a67dc257/0_64_4194_2517/master/4194.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=2b264e4966c582ad84bb2fb22ad56a3a", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/deepika-padukone-bollywood-actor-faces-boycott-calls-after-joining-student-protest"}
