The coronavirus outbreak may have begun in China, but the illness is currently presenting an almost unprecedented challenge in Europe. Our guest is a man deeply involved in those efforts: Fabio Massimo Castaldo, a vice-president of the European Parliament. He is from the Five Star Movement, which is currently in coalition government in Italy, one of the countries worst hit by the virus.\n\nAdvertising\n\nCastaldo criticised the lack of a coordinated EU response to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"There should immediately be a joint health protocol across the whole continent because this virus does not recognise any borders. We are still implementing different measures in different countries and this is not acceptable, it is increasing the risk of spreading the virus,\" he told FRANCE 24's Catherine Nicholson.\n\nThe European Parliament vice president also regretted that Italy has not received more help from its EU neighbours.\n\n\"We should centralise the production, distribution and acquisition of medical equipment and devices to counteract the viruses. Germany and France refused to give part of their stocks to Italy \u2013 and in my country we don't have the industry that's able to produce ventilation equipment for example,\" he explained.\n\n>> Coronavirus in Italy: From Florence to Palermo, tourism and economy grind to a halt\n\nProgramme prepared by C\u00e9line Schmitt, Isabelle Romero, Mathilde B\u00e9n\u00e9zet and Perrine Desplats.\n\nDaily news briefReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Europe", "Talking Europe", "European Parliament", "Coronavirus", "European Union", "Italy"], "tags": ["Press room", "Coronavirus", "European Union", "coronavirus", "#CORONAVIRUS", "#FrenchLocalElections", "Italy", "European Parliament"], "authors": ["Catherine Nicholson"], "publish_date": "Mon Mar 16 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Whole-country quarantines, border closures, states of emergency, medical supplies requisitioned \u2013 and now the United States has banned most Europeans from travelling to the United States.\u00a0The coronav\u2026", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://s.france24.com/media/display/9563ad88-6769-11ea-a0bd-005056a98db9/w:1240/p:16x9/ICI L EUROPE-CASTALDO.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "France 24", "type": "article", "title": "Talking Europe - Coronavirus: 'It is crucial to implement the strictest measures as soon as possible'", "description": "Whole-country quarantines, border closures, states of emergency, medical supplies requisitioned \u2013 and now the United States has banned most Europeans from travelling to the United States.\u00a0The coronav\u2026", "url": "https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20200316-talking-europe-coronavirus-it-is-crucial-to-implement-the-most-strict-measures-as-soon-as-possible"}, "fb": {"app_id": 121241974571942, "pages": 176585044433}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FRANCE24.English", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FRANCE24.English", "published_time": "2020-03-16T12:36:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-16T12:38:14+00:00", "section": "europe", "tag": "Italy"}, "description": "Whole-country quarantines, border closures, states of emergency, medical supplies requisitioned \u2013 and now the United States has banned most Europeans from travelling to the United States.\u00a0The coronav\u2026", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@FRANCE24", "creator": "@ACatInParis"}, "keywords": "Europe,Talking Europe,European Parliament,Coronavirus,European Union,Italy", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "France 24", "application-name": "France 24", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00a7e3", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20200316-talking-europe-coronavirus-it-is-crucial-to-implement-the-most-strict-measures-as-soon-as-possible"}
