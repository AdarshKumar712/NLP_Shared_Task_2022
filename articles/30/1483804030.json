Jeanne Shaheen for listening to parents\u2019 and advocates\u2019 concerns about the high cost and shortage of available licensed child care slots. After hearing these concerns, Sen., Shaheen has become a co-sponsor of the Child Care Workforce and Facilities Act, bringing parents and other caregivers one step closer to not having to choose between work and child care.\n\nThe average cost of child care in New Hampshire is astounding \u2013 often higher than the annual cost of in-state college tuition. These costs, paired with the shortage of available licensed child care slots, are alarming and unacceptable.\n\nWithout adequate child care, parents are forced to choose between leaving the work force, which takes a significant toll on the local economy, and finding unlicensed care, which has the potential to negatively impact a child\u2019s development.\n\nThis act would provide states with the funds to build child care facilities and to train, incentivize and retain child care workers. As a result, there would be more child care slots available so that more children could thrive in environments that provide a strong foundation for their successful futures.\n\nIn addition, since parents would be able to enroll their children in high-quality child care, this act would enable parents to contribute to the local economy by remaining in the workforce, thus boosting the local economy.\n\nI thank Sen. Shaheen for her keen commitment to bipartisan solutions, and for showing strong support for New Hampshire\u2019s working families and children.\n\nBARBARA SOUTHARD\n\nBradford", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Bradford NH", ""], "tags": ["Bradford NH"], "authors": ["Leah Willingham -", "David Brooks -", "Michael Casey -", "Ray Duckler -"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:01:22 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "I am writing to thank Sen.
