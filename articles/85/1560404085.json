Flight cancellations and trade restrictions by countries have severely constrained access to essential medicines, including vaccines.\"\n\nGovernments may in future need to postpone preventive mass vaccination campaigns -- where people group together to receive inoculations -- to ensure these do not contribute to the spread of COVID-19, Fore said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["coronavirus", "forcing", "parents", "skip", "kids", "vaccinations", "unicef"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "KABUL: The novel coronavirus pandemic that has forced billions of people across the globe to stay home is making parents skip routine immunisations for their kids, the United Nations...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "TITLE": "Coronavirus forcing parents to skip kids\u2019 vaccinations: Unicef | Pakistan | thenews.com.pk", "description": "KABUL: The novel coronavirus pandemic that has forced billions of people across the globe to stay home is making parents skip routine immunisations for their kids, the United Nations...", "keywords": "coronavirus,forcing,parents,skip,kids,vaccinations,unicef", "fb": {"app_id": 650123461797330}, "og": {"title": "Coronavirus forcing parents to skip kids\u2019 vaccinations: Unicef", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 390}, "description": "KABUL: The novel coronavirus pandemic that has forced billions of people across the globe to stay home is making parents skip routine immunisations for their kids, the United Nations...", "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/635244-coronavirus-forcing-parents-to-skip-kids-vaccinations-unicef", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thenews_intl", "creator": "@AFP", "title": "Coronavirus forcing parents to skip kids\u2019 vaccinations: Unicef", "description": "KABUL: The novel coronavirus pandemic that has forced billions of people across the globe to stay home is making parents skip routine immunisations for their kids, the United Nations...", "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=072925"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The News International", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#333333", "theme-color": "#000000"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/635244-coronavirus-forcing-parents-to-skip-kids-vaccinations-unicef"}
