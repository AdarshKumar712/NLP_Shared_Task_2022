Although you do the work because of the love I have for the people, it\u2019s nice to be recognized.\u201d\n\nHibbert, who was born in Toronto but moved to London as a youngster, does multicultural outreach for LUSO Community Services. He\u2019s seen the city\u2019s population grow and its \u201ccultural and racial makeup\u201d shift dramatically since the 1970s, describing it as \u201cone of the greatest things I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nBut that diversity has also sparked challenges, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are actually still pockets within the community (where) racism exists, discrimination exists, ethnic misunderstandings also occur,\u201d Hibbert said.\n\nBut he said he feels Londoners are increasingly having the tough conversations.\n\n\u201cThe racism that has happened maybe 50 to 60 years ago was very blatant,\u201d Hibbert said.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s very different in that it\u2019s very subtle. There are a lot of unconscious biases and a lot of micro-aggressions that take place. It\u2019s still very hurtful. It can be exhausting for racialized community members to keep fighting these battles are that are not as \u2018in your face,\u2019\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s a history London knows well, marked by episodes such as a racial slur hurled at two black actors \u2013 in town to appear in a play about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. And as recently as this fall, a Western University student who called out a professor for using the n-word in a lecture faced an onslaught of racist attacks.\n\nBut there\u2019s one lesson that keeps Hibbert plugging ahead.\n\n\u201cPeople can change. That is one thing that\u2019s an encouraging factor for me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhere people are now, isn\u2019t where they\u2019ll end up.\u201d\n\nmstacey@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/MeganatLFPress\n\nOTHERS ON THE MAYOR\u2019S NEW YEAR\u2019S HONOUR LIST\n\nHayden Foulon (posthumously), Distinguished Londoner\n\nFoulon died in November 2019 after a years-long battle with cancer, throughout which she advocated for childhood cancer awareness and research.
