Trump spoke about Iraq, impeachment, China trade and North Korea on the way into the party.\n\nHours after Iran-backed militia supporters stormed the the U.S. embassy in Iraq on Tuesday, President Trump and first lady Melania Trump walked the red carpet into the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago for his annual New Year\u2019s Eve party.\n\nBefore entering the ballroom, the president lauded the U.S. military units that responded to the violence and defended the compound, adding that he would not allow \u201canother Benghazi.\u201d During the 2016 campaign, Trump often revived the 2012 deadly assault on a U.S. mission in Libya to chide his opponent, Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the attack.\n\n\u201cBenghazi should never have happened and there will never be a Benghazi,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have the greatest warriors and they got there very quickly. As soon as they saw there was a potential problem, they got there and then there was no problem whatsoever.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet earlier Tuesday, Trump blamed Iran for the attack and said those involved would be \u201cheld responsible.\u201d On Tuesday evening, he said he hoped peace would prevail in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cI want to have peace. I like peace,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd Iran should want peace more than anyone.\u201c\n\nThe president last hosted the traditional New Year\u2019s Eve party in 2017. The event went on as scheduled in 2018, but the president did not attend the festivities because he remained in Washington due to the government shutdown.\n\nClub members and guests began strolling down the red carpet at about 8 p.m. Ivanka Trump wore a red satin gown and held the hand of her 8-year-old daughter, Arabella. Her husband, Jared Kushner ushered the couple\u2019s two young sons into the ballroom.\n\nTwo of the president\u2019s sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. were also in attendance. Eric and wife Lara did not bring their two children - both under the age of three. Donald Trump Jr. was accompanied by his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle. The president\u2019s youngest son, Barron, and daughter Tiffany Trump managed to escape notice as they navigated the walkway.\n\nOther notables at the party included Rudy Guiliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, Fox News host Lou Dobbs, Ben Carson, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nA post shared by Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk1776) on Dec 31, 2019 at 7:08pm PST\n\nThis year\u2019s party also comes as Trump has spent the better part of his 17-day holiday visit in Palm Beach seething over his impeachment in a partisan vote by the U.S. House earlier this month.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the president again had harsh words for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Democrats and the impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe impeachment thing is a hoax, a big fat hoax,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe absolutely did nothing wrong. All you have to do is read the transcripts ... Or you could also do something else. Go see and speak to the president of the Ukraine. The president of the Ukraine has said loudly and boldly that ... there was no pressure.\u201d\n\nThe president said he was unconcerned about a trial in the U.S. Senate. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter because we did nothing wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump also repeated criticism of the House Democrats and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who Trump called \u201ccorrupt.\u201d And he again called Pelosi over-rated.\n\n\u201cWhat the Democrats did in the House was a disgrace,\u201d he said, noting that while no Republicans supported the impeachment, three Democrats voted against it and one in their ranks, New Jersey\u2019s Jeff Van Drew, flipped to the GOP. \u201cThe impeachment thing, I call it impeachment light. It\u2019s a disgrace. And Nancy Pelosi should be ashamed of herself. She\u2019s a highly overrated person.\u201d\n\nTrump had softer, more measured words for North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. Right before Christmas, Kim issued a veiled threat about a \u201cChristmas gift\u201d for the United States, and American military forces have been on alert since.\n\n\u201cI have a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un,\u201d the president said. \u201cI hope his Christmas present is a beautiful vase. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like \u2014 a vase \u2014 Look, he likes me, I like him. We get along.\u201d\n\nTrump also noted Kim \u201csigned a contract\u201d to denuclearize and the president he said he expected the North Korean leader to abide by it.\n\nAs for the trade war with China, Trump said the first phase of a trade agreement will be signed on Jan. 15.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited about trade,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be going at some point to Beijing to meet with President Xi. We\u2019ll be doing something reciprocal. But I think more importantly we will be starting negotiations very soon on phase two.\u201d\n\nHe then wished the press a happy 2020 and asked them to be \u201chonorable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re honorable, I am going to win the election by a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not honorable, I\u2019m just going to win by a little. So I\u2019d rather you be honorable.\u201d\n\nRemember when Pelosi was screaming that President Trump is a danger to our nation and we must move quickly. They didn\u2019t get one Republican House vote, and lost 3 Dems. They produced no case so now she doesn\u2019t want to go to the Senate. She\u2019s all lies. Most overrated person I know!\n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2019\n\nIn addition, Trump spent much of Tuesday focused on violence toward a U.S. diplomatic compound in Iraq. Early in the day, the U.S. embassy in Baghdad was stormed and damaged by what Trump said was an Iranian orchestrated assault.\n\nIran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!\n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2019\n\nThe breaching of the embassy involved Iraqi Kateb Hezbollah protesters and others chanting anti-American slogans who smashed glass, spray painted and set the embassy walls on fire while Iraqi forces reportedly ignored diplomatic protocol to protect the grounds. The attack was believed to have been in retaliation for Sunday\u2019s U.S. missile strikes against Kateb Hezbollah, which is blamed for killing and wounding American servicemen in Iraq in recent days.\n\n.iframe-container { overflow: hidden; padding-top: 300%; position: relative;}.iframe-container iframe { border: 0; height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;}", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "Washington County News/Holmes County Times-Advertiser", "title": "Trump in Palm Beach:", "description": "This year\u2019s party comes amid political and international tensions.
