Camberos said not all of the victims died from gunshot wounds. Some were stabbed and others beaten with objects.\n\nNo guards or police were wounded, Camberos said. He did not offer a possible motive, but such killings frequently involve score settling between rival cartel members or a battle for control of the prison's illicit business.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["", "wire", "general news", "prison riots", "prisons", "correctional systems", "law and order"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 At least 16 inmates in a central Mexico prison were killed and five more were wounded in a riot that closed out a violent 2019 for", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://globegazette.com/content/tncms/site/icon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": ", wire, general news, prison riots, prisons, correctional systems, law and order", "news_keywords": ", wire, general news, prison riots, prisons, correctional systems, law and order", "description": "MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 At least 16 inmates in a central Mexico prison were killed and five more were wounded in a riot that closed out a violent 2019 for", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=437581408", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.globegazette.news", "googlebot": "noarchive", "google-site-verification": "_As_f7gitKA5YkXZrMgIu7WOs7h0VYaavTdsfzPzaXk", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://globegazette.com/news/world/at-least-dead-wounded-in-central-mexico-prison-riot/article_6bf62dbe-ee95-547d-a70c-b39d40366f96.html", "title": "At least 16 dead, 5 wounded in central Mexico prison riot", "description": "MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 At least 16 inmates in a central Mexico prison were killed and five more were wounded in a riot that closed out a violent 2019 for", "site_name": "Mason City Globe Gazette", "section": "World News"}, "fb": {"pages": 289040351411}, "parsely-title": "At least 16 dead, 5 wounded in central Mexico prison riot", "parsely-link": "https://globegazette.com/news/world/at-least-dead-wounded-in-central-mexico-prison-riot/article_6bf62dbe-ee95-547d-a70c-b39d40366f96.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-01-01T12:09:17-0600", "parsely-post-id": "6bf62dbe-ee95-547d-a70c-b39d40366f96", "parsely-section": "World News", "parsely-tags": ", wire, general news, prison riots, prisons, correctional systems, law and order, ap"}, "canonical_link": "https://apnews.com/c72698299101cc6848527321b4213f80"}
