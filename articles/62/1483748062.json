After that, the moon moves from Pisces into Aries.\n\nAries (March 21-April 19)\n\nRight now you have an advantage that you don\u2019t always have so be smart and make use of it! The advantage is that bosses, parents, VIPs and the police admire you and see you as competent and capable. (Which you are.) Nevertheless, you can milk this!\n\nTaurus (April 20-May 20)\n\nThis is a great time to travel, and if you can\u2019t travel, then make travel plans. It\u2019s also a great time to learn something or get further training because you want to expand your mind. For example, change your routine. Go someplace you\u2019ve never been.\n\nGemini (May 21-June 20)\n\nThis Mars is giving you the energy to work hard. Meanwhile, Venus makes you want to learn new things, travel and talk to people from other cultures. You are high visibility because the moon is at the top of your chart; nevertheless, financial matters are on your mind.\n\nCancer (June 21-July 22)\n\nBecause you will benefit from the wealth and resources of others right now, this is a good time for you! (Keep your pockets open!) For example, it\u2019s a good time to ask for a loan or a mortgage. Incidentally, someone wants to talk to you, especially someone younger.\n\nLeo (July 23-Aug. 22)\n\nRelations with close friends are warm and friendly now because fair Venus is opposite your sign paving the way for charm encounters with everyone. This is a good thing because things are a bit chaotic at home, which is perhaps annoying.\n\nVirgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)\n\nAccept all invitations to party and socialize with others because this is a playful time for you! Enjoy sports events, the arts, movies, musical performances and fun activities with kids. Relations with coworkers are also warm and friendly.\n\nLibra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)\n\nYour focus continues to be on home, family and your private life, especially with a parent and younger people. Please note that this is a good time to do repairs where you live. It\u2019s also a great time to party and schmooze because Venus wants you to socialize extensively!\n\nScorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)\n\nIt\u2019s fortunate that fiery Mars is in your sign boosting your energy because this is a busy time for you! Short trips, errands and conversations (plus increased reading and writing) have you hopping! In addition, you want to redecorate and entertain at home.\n\nSagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)\n\nThe placement of Venus right now in your chart will make you charming and diplomatic with everyone, which is fortuitous because you are focused on financial wheeling and dealing. \u201cShow me the money!\u201d In addition, fiery Mars will be in your sign boosting your energy for the next month.\n\nCapricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)\n\nThis continues to be a favorable time for you with the sun, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto all in your sign. Indeed, the entire world is having Capricorn hit. You will attract money to you now. In turn, you will spend it on beautiful things for yourself and loved ones.\n\nAquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)\n\nThis is still a wonderful time to buy wardrobe items for yourself, so please do so because this opportunity will not come again for months. Despite your impulse to play things low-key, with Mars high in your chart your ambition is aroused.\n\nPisces (Feb. 19-March 20)\n\nYour popularity, which is going to increase this year, has already begun. (Surely you have noticed.) Younger people in particular are attracted to you. You shine in group situations right now. Meanwhile, some are dabbling in a secret love affair.\n\nIf Your Birthday Is Today\n\nActor Morris Chestnut (1969) shares your birthday. You are imaginative, creative and yet, cautious. Your great strength is that you are adaptable. Service to others is your theme this year, especially with family. This means you must take care of yourself so that you are a strong resource for yourself and others. Invest in the relationships that you value. Tap into your personal creativity and hobbies.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Georgia Nicols", "Sam Kelly", "Sun-Times Wire", "Dec"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Moon Alert\nAvoid shopping and important decisions from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. Chicago time.
