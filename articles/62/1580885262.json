If done too quickly, we risk a resurgence that could be even worse than our present situation.\u201d\n\nHe said, first of all, governments must ensure that the spread of the novel coronavirus is under control.\n\nAccording to new WHO guidelines, this means health authorities must know the origin of every single case and cluster of infections.\n\nNational health systems must also be able to find, test, isolate and treat every new case, and all recent social contacts of every infected person must be tracked down.\n\nIn addition, Tedros stressed that countries that want to ease their curbs must minimise infection risks in hot spot settings such as hospitals and nursing homes.\n\nAs a fourth condition, Tedros said preventive measures must be in place in workplaces, schools and other essential locations. These include physical distancing, hygiene etiquette and, possibly, temperature measurements, according to the new WHO guidelines.\n\nCountries must also manage the risk of importing new cases from abroad by detecting infected travellers and quarantining those who arrive from hot spot countries.\n\nLastly, Tedros said it is important that \u201ccommunities are fully educated, engaged and empowered to adjust to the \u2018new norm\u2019\u201d of behaving in ways that prevent new infections.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Citizen"], "publish_date": "Fri Apr 17 04:04:24 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://thecitizenng.com/wp-content/themes/jarida/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "WHO lists six conditions for easing COVID-19 restrictions", "description": "Countries\u00a0that want to lift coronavirus restrictions must meet a row of conditions to prevent anothe...", "url": "https://thecitizenng.com/who-lists-six-conditions-for-easing-covid-19-restrictions/", "site_name": "TheCitizen - It's all about you", "image": "https://thecitizenng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WHO.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheCitizenNG", "section": "Global News", "published_time": "2020-04-17T04:04:24+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Countries\u00a0that want to lift coronavirus restrictions must meet a row of conditions to prevent another surge of infections, the World Health Organisation (WHO) chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said, yesterday.
