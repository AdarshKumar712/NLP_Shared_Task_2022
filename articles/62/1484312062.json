It mixes contemporary and modern perfectly, with slashes of colour, tartan chairs and chandelier-style lighting.\n\nService\n\nPrompt \u2013 and always with a smile. Our bubbly waiters were keen to cater for our every need \u2013 and even asked if we needed a bigger break before dessert. They must be used to diners struggling with the large portions.\n\nMenu\n\nOur visit is during a Sunday lunch sitting. Despite it being a set menu, we find ourselves spoilt for choice. There are nine starter options, from mussels and minestrone soup to bruschetta and breaded mushrooms. For mains, there\u2019s a bit of everything from roast of the day to salads and seafood, as well as cheeseburgers and curries. In the mood for a bit of everything, we find ourselves choosing a dish by process of elimination.\n\nTaste\n\nThe haggis bon bons with whisky sauce and stuffed mushrooms set the precedent for a fabulous feast. A steak pie with the biggest pastry topping I\u2019ve ever seen arrives, with carrots and roasties on the side. The tender meat melts in the mouth and the pastry is perfectly flaky on top and doughy underneath. The roast is lamb with all the trimmings, and its delicious.\n\nAmbience\n\nThere\u2019s a relaxed, homely feel. A comfortable place to kick back and relax at the end of a busy weekend.\n\nPrice\n\nAt \u00a313.95 for two courses and an additional \u00a33 for three, its an absolute bargain. Our bill came in at around \u00a380 for four and it was worth every penny.\n\nToilets\n\nA bit of a trek as you have to use the ones just off reception, but clean \u2013 and pretty.\n\nThe Avonbridge owners, Luigi and Rita Martalo, also have a second restaurant, Bar Milano, on site, so if you\u2019re more in the mood for pizza and pasta, you could check that out instead.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Restaurant of the Week"], "authors": ["The Sunday Post"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 00:01:17 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.sundaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/12/cropped-sp-icon-32x32.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Restaurant of the week: The Apron Restaurant, Carlisle Road, Hamilton - Sunday Post", "description": "", "url": "https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/the-apron-restaurant-carlisle-road-hamilton/", "site_name": "Sunday Post", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.sundaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/12/Image-57-B_34013379-Read-Only-e1576246632900.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.sundaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/12/Image-57-B_34013379-Read-Only-e1576246632900.jpg", "width": 918, "height": 578}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SundayPostUK/", "tag": "Restaurant of the Week", "section": "Food"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "", "title": "Restaurant of the week: The Apron Restaurant, Carlisle Road, Hamilton - Sunday Post", "site": "@Sunday_Post", "image": "https://www.sundaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/12/Image-57-B_34013379-Read-Only-e1576246632900-896x564.jpg", "creator": "@Sunday_Post"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "golden-content": "false", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-02 00:01:17", "sailthru.title": "Restaurant of the week: The Apron Restaurant, Carlisle Road, Hamilton", "sailthru.tags": "sunday-post, Restaurant of the Week, Lifestyle, Food", "sailthru.author": "Reporter", "sailthru.description": "", "sailthru.image.full": "https://www.sundaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/12/Image-57-B_34013379-Read-Only-e1576246632900.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://www.sundaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/12/Image-57-B_34013379-Read-Only-e1576246632900-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-thumbnail": "https://www.sundaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/12/Image-57-B_34013379-Read-Only-e1576246632900-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-medium": "https://www.sundaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/12/Image-57-B_34013379-Read-Only-e1576246632900-286x180.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-large": "https://www.sundaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/12/Image-57-B_34013379-Read-Only-e1576246632900-896x564.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-full": "https://www.sundaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/12/Image-57-B_34013379-Read-Only-e1576246632900.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.sundaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/12/cropped-sp-icon-270x270.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/the-apron-restaurant-carlisle-road-hamilton/"}
