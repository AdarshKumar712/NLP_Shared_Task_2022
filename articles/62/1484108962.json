They date back from 2014,\u201d says Tirupati, pointing to a house where registration number plates are neatly stored in shelves.\n\nTirupati manages the HSNP affixing business at Kondapur RTA. \u201cThe number plates were fixed by a private party here. But now, showrooms are supposed to fix the number plates to vehicles,\u201d informs the RTA official.\n\nPeriodic audit by the HSNP facility revealed that 18,000 to 24,000 number plates remain undelivered per quarter. The result? Chaos on the roads of Hyderabad. Missing number plates, some covered with paint or duct tape on one digit, and bent on hundreds of vehicles plying in the city. \u201cWe caught them for not wearing helmet and they started removing the paper covering the number plate. This can be a very dangerous offence,\u201d says a senior traffic officer as his colleagues stop vehicles near Gudimalkapur. The two boys grin, pay \u20b9200 fine and zip away.\n\nSurveillance fear\n\nWith the rise in surveillance cameras in the city, there has been a spurt in vehicle owners resorting to criminal techniques to hide or deface the registration numbers to avoid penalties. Even the accused in the Shadnagar gangrape and murder case had destroyed the number plate of the veterinarian\u2019s vehicle.\n\nThe dependence of traffic police on surveillance cameras can be seen from the fact that the department, in 2019, logged 39,48,752 non-contact Motor Vehicle Act violations, as against 6,80,083 violations where the police had to intervene.\n\nUsual suspects\n\nHiding the number plates is a high stakes criminal enterprise when it comes to heavy-duty trucks transporting building debris and construction material. \u201cLook at this. He has smudged two digits of the rear number plate and hung a black cloth to block the view from the front,\u201d says a police official as the driver of AP22-1302 tries to cook up an explanation.\n\nIn September, the Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department notified GO-632 that levied hefty penalty for transporting construction and building debris. The first offence draws a penalty of \u20b925,000, the second offence \u20b950,000 and a third offence would lead to confiscation of vehicle used and a penalty of \u20b91 lakh.\n\n\u201cUnless we can press criminal charges against vehicle owners for disfiguring the number plates, this will go on,\u201d says the traffic official overseeing the checkpoint at Gudimalkapur.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Telangana State Road Transport Authority; high security number plates; traffic; Kondapur"], "tags": ["gadgets (general)", "police", "space programme", "Fact Check", "constitution", "university", "Tamil cinema", "The Hindu Explains", "population and census", "Citizenship Amendment Act"], "authors": ["Starting With Formation Of A Separate High Court", "The Year Was Tumultous", "In The News For All Right", "Wrong Reasons.
