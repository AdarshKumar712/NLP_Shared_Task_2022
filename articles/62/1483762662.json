Nevertheless Jurgen Klopp\u2019s men would be well advised to not be overconfident against a side that matched City in the first half and only succumbed to second half goals from Kun Aguero and Kevin de Bruyne.\n\nPep Guardiola\u2019s side play one of the game of the day as they entertain an Everton that looks to be born again since the departure of Marco Silva and the arrival of Carlo Ancelotti as first team coach.\n\nCity kick off 14 points behind Liverpool, who have played one game less, and Guardiola will maybe be better fixing his sights on his side\u2019s Champions League campaign, where they face Real Madrid in the next round.\n\nThe next two months have to see him resolve his City\u2019s defensive weaknesses and hope that Aymeric Laporte completes his recovery from knee surgery to be fit to face Madrid.\n\nSecond placed Leicester City travel to Newcastle on the back of their weekend triumph against West Ham United, which saw Manuel Pellegrini replaced by David Moyes in the \u201cHammers\u201d hot-seat.\n\nMoyes will make his return to West Ham with a vital home match against Bournemouth, who are one point and one place above them following a run of seven defeats from their last nine games.\n\nArsenal coach Mikel Arteta is having a tough baptism at the club and his side\u2019s home game against Manchester United is another standout fixture to start 2020. Arsenal go into the game on the back of their 2-1 capitulation at home to Chelsea, which again highlighted the team\u2019s mental frailty, while United look to be gaining confidence and have moved up to fifth after Christmas wins over Newcastle and Burnley.\n\nChelsea travel to Brighton for what should be a close game, while Tottenham visit Southampton after a 2-2 draw against Norwich three days ago highlighted that Jose Mourinho\u2019s side need to tighten up at the back if they want to compete for a top-four finish.\n\nNorwich entertain Crystal Palace looking for their first win since November 23rd and knowing they too have to stop leaking goals if they want to stay up.\n\nNigel Pearson may have a reputation for being a somewhat dour character but he has won almost as many points from his first three games in charge (7) as his two predecessors did (9) in the previous 17 and suddenly confidence is soaring at Vicarage Road.\n\nA win at home to Wolves wouldn\u2019t be enough to lift Watford out of the relegation zone, but it would increase their hopes of survival, while increasing the pressure on Aston Villa, who face a difficult trip to play Burnley at Turf Moor.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://famagusta-gazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FGicon.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@Mandy Jackson", "site": "@MandyJa82022964", "title": "New Year kicks off with a full round of fixtures", "description": "The New Year kicks off with a full round of fixtures in the Premier League as Liverpool look to continue what looks to be an unstoppable march towards their first title in 30 years, while everyone els", "image": "http://famagusta-gazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/football32.jpeg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.0.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://famagusta-gazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FGicon.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "http://famagusta-gazette.com/2020/01/01/new-year-kicks-off-with-a-full-round-of-fixtures/"}
