(Fast-forward to 7:46 for \u201cBird on the Wire\u201d and 30:08 for \u201cSo Long Marianne.\u201d)\n\nGilmour went with Cohen tunes since Theater for Dreamers takes place on the Greek island of Hydra in the Sixties, which is where the songwriter lived during that time. He\u2019s even a character in the book.\n\n\u201cBird on the Wire\u201d was partially written in Hydra and \u201cSo Long, Marianne\u201d is about his relationship with long-time romantic partner Marianne Ihlen. They met on Hydra and lived there for a number of years. The 2019 Nick Broomfield documentary Marianne & Leonard: Words of Love chronicles their tumultuous love affair.\n\nOn the webcast, Gilmour and Samson were joined by their children and other members of their family on a set designed to look like a cafe in Hydra \u2014 down to the candles, wine glasses and a basket of oranges. Their daughter Romany joins in on harmony vocals during both songs.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Samson announced plans for another livestream tomorrow at 3:00 pm ET. She also posted a brief Instagram video of David Gilmour strumming along to a recording of Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHey, That\u2019s No Way to Say Goodbye,\u201d a possible preview of the song he plans on playing.\n\nGilmour has kept a very low profile since the conclusion of his Rattle That Lock world tour in 2016. Last year, he sold many of his guitars at a charity auction that netted more than $20 million. In September 2019, Roger Waters told Rolling Stone that he met up with Gilmour in June of that year. The two have been estranged from each other for many years.\n\n\u201cWe had a big meeting where I came up with a big peace plan that has come to nothing, sadly,\u201d Waters said. \u201cI bet all Pink Floyd fans are sorry to hear that.
