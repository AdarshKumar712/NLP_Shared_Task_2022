Few months back, we had sent a proposal to build medical colleges in Narmada, Porbandar and Navsari districts. Now, we are sending another proposal to the Centre to approve medical colleges in these five districts,\" said Patel.\n\nTo run a medical college, the attached hospital must have at least 300 beds as per the MCI norms.\n\nThus, the state government will first upgrade these five hospitals as per the norms before building the medical colleges, said Patel, adding that each college would cost Rs 325 crore, taking the total expenditure to Rs 1625 crore.\n\nThe proposed medical colleges are situated in Godhra town in Panchmahal, Khambhalia in Devbhumi-Dwarka, Veraval in Gir-Somnath, and in Botad and Morbi.\n\n\"As per the central scheme, 60 per cent of the Rs 1625 crore cost for the five colleges will be borne by the Centre while the state government would contribute 40 per cent. We will a give the land free of cost. Each college will have the intake capacity of 100 MBBS seats,\" said Patel.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["States and union territories of India", "Districts of India", "Subdivisions of India", "Hindu pilgrimage sites in India", "Gujarat", "Somnath temple", "Dwarka", "Panchmahal district", "Kathiawar", "Pushtimarg Baithak", "Central government", "deputy Chief Minister", "India", "Nitin"], "tags": ["Education"], "authors": ["Press Trust Of India"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Read more about Guj govt proposes 5 new medical colleges to augment MBBS seats on Business Standard.
