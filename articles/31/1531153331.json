There are plenty on the trees, so just check each tree once and move along. You won't have time to dawdle; I'll need them in time for lunch in a half-hour.\"\n\nThe girl thought this should be simple enough when she arrived at the orchard. However, as she walked the rows of trees, she found it difficult to choose. Each apple she inspected seemed to be of exceptional quality.\n\nShe would look over one tree, but decide that the next tree might hold better apples. After all, she only wanted to pick the best and reddest. But when she reached the edge of the orchard, her basket was empty. And she was late for lunch.\n\n\"All those trees and I couldn't make up my mind,\" she thought. \"What if I didn't get the best ones?\"\n\nWas it the fear of making a poor decision or just uncertainty? That day, she realized that hesitating to make a decision and holding out for something better had prevented her from realizing the value of what was right in front of her.\n\nWe have all second-guessed ourselves or hesitated at some point \u2014 and usually for good reason. Perhaps new information came to light, or a budget couldn't be stretched, or staff couldn't handle any more work. Those are reasonable causes for hesitation.\n\nAnd while I often advise people to trust their instincts, it's also important to know the difference between hesitating and deciding on inaction because you don't know where to begin.\n\nSmall or large problems that can be overcome should not hold up a project when all the other elements are in place. Putting off a decision disrupts the momentum when key players are ready to go.\n\nWhen indecision and hesitation go beyond the necessary fact-gathering and initial planning, find a way to take a first step.\n\nIf making a decision is the problem, explore the possible reasons: Fear of failure, fear of success, lack of resources or experience, tight deadlines, even sheer laziness \u2014 all are potential buzzkills.\n\nThose are, however, all surmountable problems. Fears, even when reasonable, are only as scary as you make them. Failure isn't fatal, as I like to say, and success is sweet. Visualize what a completed project would look like and go from there. Put your imagination to work, and allow yourself to dream a little. Think about what could go right instead of what could go wrong.\n\nWhen resources are in short supply, turn it into an opportunity to make do with what you have. Look for ways to repurpose existing budgets or staffing to adjust to changing needs. It's not always simple, to be sure, but organizations face similar challenges every day.\n\nHarvey Mackay.\n\nIf you're short on experience, get busy and study up. Find a mentor, take a class, read everything you can get your hands on. Pick the brains of your staff and colleagues.\n\nIf laziness is the big issue, then my suggestion is to move aside and get out of the way for those who can get the job done. Seriously. Motivation is critical to decision-making, and if your hesitation is causing a project to suffer, then the problem is not the project.\n\nI'll share a little rhyme that has helped me get moving when I need a jump-start. I wish I could find the author so I could express my gratitude for the inspiration. See if it doesn't help you, too.\n\nHow and When\n\nWe are often greatly bothered\n\nBy two fussy little men,\n\nWho sometimes block our pathway \u2014\n\nTheir names are How and When.\n\nIf we have a task or duty\n\nWhich we can put off awhile,\n\nAnd we do not go and do it \u2014\n\nYou should see those two rogues smile.\n\nBut there is a way to beat them,\n\nAnd I will tell you how:\n\nIf you have a task or duty,\n\nDo it well, and do it now.\n\nIf you see yourself in this little ditty, it's time to rethink your future. Because the future belongs to those who act!\n\nMackay's Moral: \"Do it well\" \u2014 or why bother? \"Do it now\" \u2014 and then get on to the next challenge!\n\nwww.harveymackay.com \u2022 MackayMitchell Envelope Co., 2100 Elm St. SE, Minneapolis, MN 55414.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Feb 24 23:47:39 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "9451CA04ABC9D1D5C6419C73B4C4F7B7", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/76/02/34/16262947/161/rawImage.jpg", "title": "How to deal with excessive hesitation", "site": "@timesunion"}, "environment": "pwcm5", "id": 15081130, "date.release": "2020-02-24 23:47:41", "time.release": "2020-02-24 23:47:41", "sections": "Business", "subject": "Column Mackay, D.
