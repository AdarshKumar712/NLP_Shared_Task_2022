(File Photo) Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that like IAS, IPS, India needs a proper All India Judicial Service. (File Photo)\n\nPolitical acrimony over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act intensified Wednesday with Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad reading Constitutional provisions to state governments, saying they would have to implement the Act, while Kerala Chief Minister M Pinarayi Vijayan reminded the Centre that state assemblies have their own privileges.\n\nA day after the Kerala House passed a resolution demanding the scrapping of the CAA, Prasad cited Constitutional clauses and asked state governments to get \u201cbetter legal advises\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising that the governments that have taken oath on the Constitution are talking anti-Constitutional that we will not implement the CAA. It\u2019s passed by Parliament\u2026 Laws passed by Parliament will be implemented throughout the country\u2026 Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, Parliament may make laws for the whole or any part of the Union of India,\u201d Prasad told reporters.\n\nHe cited Articles 245, 246 and 256 \u2014 that deal with the enactment of laws and demarcation of powers for the Union and the states \u2014 to assert that every state is obliged to implement rules made by Parliament, and said citizenship is a subject on which Parliament can form rules for the entire country.\n\n\u201cLegislature of the state may make laws for the whole or any part of the state. Article 245 (clause 2): No law made by Parliament shall be deemed to be invalid on the ground that it would have extra-territorial operation,\u201d he said.\n\nReminding the states of their \u201cConstitutional responsibility\u201d, Prasad said: \u201cIf they have taken oath on the Constitution, they should respect its provisions. Those state governments may take better legal advises.\u201d\n\nRejecting BJP\u2019s criticism against the Kerala assembly\u2019s resolution, Vijayan maintained that assemblies have their own privileges.\n\nReacting to BJP MP G V L Narasimha Rao\u2019s move write to Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to initiate breach of parliamentary privileges and contempt proceedings against him over the resolution, Vijayan said in Thiruvananthapuram: \u201cState assemblies have own privileges. Such actions are unheard of anywhere. But we cannot rule out anything in the present circumstance as unprecedented things are happening nowadays in the country.\u201d\n\nThe assemblies, he said, have their own special protection and that should not be violated. He said Kerala has become the first state to pass a resolution against a law which has been violating the fundamental principles of the Constitution and it has great significance.\n\nWhile Chief Ministers of non-BJP ruled states like Mamata Banerjee of West Bengal and Congress-ruled states have announced that they would not implement CAA, the CPM-led Left Democratic Front-ruled Kerala was the first to take the legislature route to register its opposition to the law.\n\nIn September last year, West Bengal assembly passed a resolution denouncing the National Register of Citizens (NRC), an exercise that took place in Assam.\n\nThe state assemblies have in the past too passed resolutions against laws passed by Parliament. In 2014, the assembly of undivided Andhra Pradesh had passed a resolution rejecting the Central government\u2019s Bill to create Telangana \u2014 the Congress was in power, both at the Centre and in the state then. However, the central government went ahead with the bifurcation of the state.\n\nAlso Read | Rioting FIR has details, timeline, gives clean chit to police; FIR on killing is just one para\n\nIn 2016, when the Supreme Court had ordered release of Cauvery water for Tamil Nadu, the Karnataka legislature had adopted an unanimous resolution to use the Cauvery water only to meet drinking water needs and not to provide it for any other purpose.\n\nIn 2018, the Delhi assembly, in which AAP has a brute majority, passed a resolution demanding that Bharat Ratna awarded to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi be withdrawn over the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["kerala assembly caa resolution", "ravi shankar prasad", "pinarayi vijayan", "pinarayi vijayan on caa", "caa protests", "citizenship amendment act", "indian express news"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Liz Mathew"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 04:34:50 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A day after the Kerala House passed a resolution demanding the scrapping of the CAA, Prasad cited Constitutional clauses and asked state governments to get \u201cbetter legal advises\u201d.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/10/fav-icon.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=990", "news_keywords": "kerala assembly caa resolution, ravi shankar prasad, pinarayi vijayan, pinarayi vijayan on caa, caa protests, Citizenship Amendment Act, indian express news", "keywords": "kerala assembly caa resolution, ravi shankar prasad, pinarayi vijayan, pinarayi vijayan on caa, caa protests, citizenship amendment act, indian express news", "google-site-verification": "UzbS4ghT-l3F85eDiPbzEUeeKcvrnrGCgvsNHCRgvIc", "msvalidate.01": "CCA9DA5B985004F4462DA743E776C636", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "fb": {"pages": 215732349153100}, "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/caa-kerala-pinarayi-vijayan-ravi-shankar-prasad-6195418/?ia_markup=1"}, "description": "A day after the Kerala House passed a resolution demanding the scrapping of the CAA, Prasad cited Constitutional clauses and asked state governments to get \u201cbetter legal advises\u201d.", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/caa-kerala-pinarayi-vijayan-ravi-shankar-prasad-6195418/", "site_name": "The Indian Express", "locale": "en_US", "title": "No to CAA: Prasad tells states to seek better legal advice, Pinarayi hits back", "description": "A day after the Kerala House passed a resolution demanding the scrapping of the CAA, Prasad cited Constitutional clauses and asked state governments to get \u201cbetter legal advises\u201d.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/12/ravi-shankar-prasad-759.jpg?w=759", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 759, "height": 422}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "The Indian Express", "creator": "@indianexpress", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/caa-kerala-pinarayi-vijayan-ravi-shankar-prasad-6195418/", "title": "No to CAA: Prasad tells states to seek better legal advice, Pinarayi hits back", "description": "A day after the Kerala House passed a resolution demanding the scrapping of the CAA, Prasad cited Constitutional clauses and asked state governments to get \u201cbetter legal advises\u201d.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/12/ravi-shankar-prasad-759.jpg?w=759", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 759, "height": 422}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-02T04:34:50+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T04:34:50+05:30"}, "robots": "NOODP", "majestic-site-verification": "MJ12_ad7db024-a46c-482a-bb2f-e1ae09432a65", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/10/fav-icon.png?w=120"}, "canonical_link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/caa-kerala-pinarayi-vijayan-ravi-shankar-prasad-6195418/"}
