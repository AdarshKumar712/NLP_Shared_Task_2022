Average people just assume that the medical community has our best interests in mind so they don\u2019t scrutinize the information coming from that direction to the same degree.\n\nThe white lab coat has been offered as a symbol of unbiased purity. FFS, think about how Monsanto used to be given a wide pass merely because SciEnTiStS dOn\u2019T liE tO uS, aNd MoNsAnTo = sCiEnCe!\n\nThankfully people are starting to wise up to the whole Monsanto/Bayer debacle and have realized that Monsanto was successfully pulling off unfactual Tobacco $cience for decades. Big victory for humanity!\n\nThe problem is, they\u2019re still ignoring a huge fucking elephant in the corner.\n\nThe medical system in the USA kills approximately 225,000 people every year. About 106,000 of those people died from drugs they were prescribed.\n\nDid you catch that? About 106,000 people die every year due to following the instructions of their doctor and taking the drugs prescribed to them as directed.\n\nJon Rappoport points out that the medical community supports and is supported by both sides of the political spectrum and enjoys a type of invisibilty and freedom from scrutiny due to this percieved neutrality. They aren\u2019t \u201cneutral\u201d, though. Their polararity slide can be labeled Government Granted Power vs. The Best Interests of the Populace. They have polarized in one major direction: suckling the teats of government and consolidating power while ignoring the best interests of the populace.\n\nFrom this link, written by investigative journalist Jon Rappoport:\n\nWhich is Worse: The NSA or The FDA?\n\nDecember 30, 2019\n\nBy Jon Rappoport\n\nA message to WikiLeaks, Cryptome, Public Intelligence, and other sites that expose secrets.\n\nDoes 2.25 million deaths in America, per decade, at the hands of the medical system, rate as a significant leak?\n\nAs my readers know, I\u2019ve reported on a number of scandals concerning the toxicity of medical drugs, including shocking death numbers in the US.\n\nThese scandals are leaks from inside the National Security State.\n\nIf you visit WikiLeaks, Cryptome, Public Intelligence, and other similar sites, how many purely medical documents do you find posted?\n\nHow many damaging leaks exposing the crimes of the medical cartel do you find?\n\nVery, very few.\n\nWhere are the medical insiders who are liberating and passing along incriminating documentary evidence?\n\nSome of the best exposers of political, intelligence-agency, and military crimes are way behind the curve, when it comes to medical matters.\n\nThe medical sphere, for various reasons, is far better protected than any other segment of society.\n\nFor the hundredth time, let me cite Dr. Barbara Starfield\u2019s stunning review, \u201cIs US health really the best in the world?\u201d published on July 26, 2000, in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nStarfield, at the time, was working as a highly respected public health expert, at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.\n\nShe concluded that the US medical system kills 225,000 Americans a year. That would add up to 2.25 million deaths per decade.\n\nLaid directly at the door of the American medical complex.\n\n106,000 of those annual deaths, as Starfield reports, are the direct result of medical drugs.\n\nAside from the genocidal death toll, Starfield\u2019s findings also imply massive fraud in all medical journals that routinely publish glowing results of clinical trials of drugs.\n\nSuch trials open the door to the marketing of drugs that kill, according to Starfield, 106,000 Americans every year. How is this possible unless deep, continuing, and abetted research fraud are the order of the day?\n\nIndeed, Dr. Marcia Angell, the editor of New England Journal of Medicine for 20 years, wrote the following:\n\n\u201cIt is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.\u201d (NY Review of Books, January 15, 2009)\n\nThe FDA, of course, is the single government agency responsible for certifying drugs as safe and effective, before their public release is permitted. Yet the FDA takes absolutely no responsibility for the deaths.\n\nCan you imagine the feeding frenzy, if, say, some leaker in the Pentagon passed along a political/military document to Wikileaks that showed the Dept. of Defense was poisoning to death, like clockwork, a hundred thousand of its own soldiers every year?\n\nLet\u2019s stop this insane nonsense of separating one whole set of government crimes from another, simply because the propagandized priests in the white coats are above reproach.\n\nWe\u2019re not living in 1950 anymore, and this isn\u2019t Kansas.\n\nIn 1988, when I was writing my first book, AIDS INC., I stated that medical covert ops are the most successful methods for pacifying, debilitating, and controlling populations, through toxification, because these ops fly the flag of political neutrality.\n\nThey appear to favor no king, dictator, president, government administration or partisan position.\n\nTheir propaganda is all about healing and helping.\n\nIn fact, the medical cartel is, in the long run, the most effective branch of political repression, from one end of the planet to the other.\n\nIt favors top-down control by those in power, whoever they are, whatever they claim to stand for.\n\nConsider this: when Ed Snowden released NSA documents that showed the extent of government surveillance on populations, no one from the intelligence establishment made a serious case that Snowden\u2019s revelations were false. Instead, they attacked Snowden for exposing \u201cmethods\u201d of \u201cthe war on terror.\u201d\n\nHowever, in the medical arena, leakers would be afraid that doctors, medical bureaucrats, public health agencies, government leaders, drug-company fronts, and major media outlets would, all at once, deny the validity and truth of the leaks\u2014despite the fact that the truth is there for all to see.\n\nIn other words, the best protected cartel in the world\u2014medical\u2014would act in a far more Orwellian fashion. It would say: the truth is not the truth, the facts are not the facts, 2 and 2 do not equal 4\u2014and the cartel would get away with doing that.\n\nThis is the kind of clout we\u2019re talking about when it comes to medical matters.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve alerted mainstream reporters to the Starfield review, cited above, and other confirming published studies that reveal the horrific extent of medical destruction. Those reporters who bothered to get back to me issued blanket denials. They essentially said, \u201cYes, I see the evidence and the facts, but the facts aren\u2019t facts. What\u2019s happening isn\u2019t happening.\u201d\n\nNow we\u2019re talking about some heavy brainwashing.\n\nBy comparison, it makes the quality of the scandal around Snowden seem like a Sunday lunch in the park.\n\nA few years ago, I had one reporter, who exposes political leaks, tell me: \u201cI don\u2019t mess with medical stuff. It would ruin my credibility.\u201d\n\nIndeed. Another indication of how powerful the medical apparatus is.\n\nRecently, the Washington Post highlighted a new study that puts \u201cmedical errors\u201d as the 3rd leading cause of death in America. There hasn\u2019t been any significant follow-up. There hasn\u2019t been an explosion of outrage. So even when exposure occurs, the brainwashing factor is so strong it makes no difference. It\u2019s just another ho-hum day in the news business.\n\nThat\u2019s mind control par excellence. That\u2019s tremendous protection of criminals.\n\nThat\u2019s like a crime boss saying, \u201cYeah, I kill 225,000 people every year, but it\u2019s an accident\u201d\u2014and nothing happens.\n\nHe goes his merry way, and everyone praises him as a humanitarian.\n\nTalk about inventing and selling false reality.\n\nThis one is at the top of the charts, and it stays there.\n\nI could stop here, but I\u2019m going to take this one step further, because, as you can see, I\u2019m talking about mind control. So here is the vital add-on:\n\nAmerican Natural Superfood \u2013 Free Sample\n\nFrom the dawn of history, humans have been particularly vulnerable to statements, from \u201cselfless altruists,\u201d about being saved, being rescued, being given gifts from above. And behind those statements, when there is an organization involved, a top-down organization, the threat level rises considerably.\n\nLeaders have always recognized that if they match their pronouncements and assurances with the population\u2019s unflagging hope of being saved, they, the leaders, win. They win big.\n\nEven in societies where overt human sacrifice was practiced, the cover story involved some kind of healing and rescue. The good gods would see the sacrifices and intervene to produce \u201cbetter days.\u201d Better life for all.\n\nThis is what was sold, and this was what was bought. For many people, the times have not changed. Make them a promise of medical rescue, and they\u2019re in. They\u2019re floating in a hopeful trance.\n\nA hypnotic induction has been performed, and it works.\n\nThe controlled subject responds with gratitude.\n\nAt that point, you can engage in complete contradictions, rank absurdities, and doublespeak.\n\nThe trance will hold.\n\nAs my old research collaborator, hypnotherapist Jack True, once told me in an interview, \u201cPeople want dreams. When they lose faith in their own ability to dream about the life they want, they\u2019ll accept someone else dreaming for them. That\u2019s what hypnosis is. Someone else dreaming for you. You accept a substitute. That\u2019s mind control. That\u2019s believing you can live in someone else\u2019s creation forever\u2026\u201d\n\nIf I were the head of an institution of higher learning, I would engrave that quote above the gates, and I would build a four-year course that explores the implications of the quote in every dimension of human existence.\n\nThe medical cartel is the best-protected organization on the planet.\n\nDisclaimer: This content does not necessarily represent the views of IWB.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["arena", "framework", "everybody", "focused", "entertainment", "while", "political"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 10:35:16 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/logo81-1-150x130.jpg", "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.9.13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/logo81-1.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/everybody-is-focused-on-the-political-arena-of-entertainment-while-the-framework-for-a-medical-tyranny-is-being-built-behind-the-scenes-theyre-trying-to-claim-ownership-of-your-body-under-the-guise/"}
