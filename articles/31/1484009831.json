Genius told the St Andrew Parish Court that the dispute started after she found her two-year-old with a condom in the house where the complainant was staying.\n\n\u201cHe started calling me big ole gal and some other language, and him rush me and I use mi hand and wrap round him head and draw him on the ground,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the pierced-nose bishop, who was clad in a red African pants suit when he appeared in court, told Judge Maxine Ellis that although they had an argument about the condom that Genius found, the incident occurred because she was carrying \u201cfeelings\u201d after he rejected her overtures.\n\nExplaining that the accused's husband had invited him to live at their home, the bishop said, \u201cI did know that they had matrimonial dispute from longer time, and when I went there she placed certain advances towards me in terms of sexually, and I go to church and I have certain beliefs so I ignore her. So because her son found that I have condoms and that I am sexually active with females, that bring the dispute between me and her.\u201d He said that on the day of the incident he was inside a room in the house when he felt a blow to the back of his head and he rushed at Genius.\n\nThey got into an argument and, according to the bishop, Genius had a stone in her hand. He said when he attacked the woman to get the stone from her, \u201cshe wrap my locks in her hand and have my face in the ground like I am her child\u201d.\n\nSometime after, he said, he realised that he had a wound to his head and that it was bleeding. The bishop further told Judge Ellis that since the incident he had received threats after Genius accused him of being gay and having an affair with her husband.\n\n\u201cShe made several men attack me in Jones Town,\u201d he said. After more charges and counter charges the judge told them to keep the peace and that set a sentencing date for July 19.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["General NewsInternationalLocal News"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jamaica Observer Limited"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The stories that made us laugh last year emanated mostly from the courts and, o...", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"alexaVerifyID": "rSmiGOPEjbvIe54g6VDdjp7fxDQ", "google-site-verification": "yGWL0JARPWTYZuQO6SyybESnW5Tn5sn_mj5vRQhwZq8", "y_key": "b1206159d404874b", "msvalidate.01": "F356DE1E2BCA8CFA747B5120592BE455", "description": "The stories that made us laugh last year emanated mostly from the courts and, o...", "keywords": "General NewsInternationalLocal News", "og": {"title": "Rift between a bishop and another bishop's wife", "site_name": "Jamaica Observer"}, "revisit-after": "1 days", "Author": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "DC.Subject": "Jamaica, Observer", "DC.Title": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "ROBOTS": "Follow,Index", "rating": "GENERAL", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@JamaicaObserver", "creator": "@JamaicaObserver", "title": "Rift between a bishop and another bishop's wife", "description": "The stories that made us laugh last year emanated mostly from the courts and, o..."}}, "canonical_link": ""}
