Digital pathology refers to the technique of analyzing high-resolution, digitally scanned histology images generated from a digitized glass slide. The specialized equipment was first used to capture images from a microscope onto photographic plates. In recent years, digital pathology has rapidly gained momentum as this technology helps in reducing laboratory expenses, improving operational efficiency, enhancing productivity, and improving treatment decisions and patient care.\n\n\n\nRequest Free Sample Report: https://www.imarcgroup.com/digital-pathology-market/requestsample\n\n\n\nGlobal Digital Pathology Market Trends:\n\nDigital pathology allows improved analysis, offers live zoom and multiple angle views, provides a dashboard view of data and annotations, and reduces errors by eliminating breakage and minimizing risk and misidentification. Apart from this, it is increasingly used by top clinical research organizations (CROs) and large biopharmaceutical manufacturers to streamline drug development processes in discovery, pre-clinical and clinical trials. This, along with the advancements in technology and software applications, such as the whole slide imaging technique, and LIS/LIMS interfacing, and high-speed networking, has fully integrated digital pathology into pathology workflows. Moreover, many leading companies are entering into a partnership to gain more profits. For instance, Huron Digital Pathology has collaborated with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) on artificial intelligence-based image search. This helps in presenting a pathologist-centric approach to image retrieval at pathology informatics. Looking forward, the market value is projected to reach US$ 984.4 Million by 2025, registering a CAGR of 11.2 % during 2020-2025.\n\n\n\nMarket Breakup by Type:\n\n\u2022Human Pathology\n\n\u2022Veterinary Pathology\n\n\n\nMarket Breakup by Product:\n\n\u2022Scanners\n\n\u2022Software\n\n\u2022Storage Systems\n\n\u2022Communication Systems\n\n\n\nMarket Breakup by Application:\n\n\u2022Training and Education\n\n\u2022Consulting Services\n\n\u2022Intraoperative Consultation\n\n\u2022Routine Diagnostic Consultation Services\n\n\u2022Others\n\n\n\nMarket Breakup by End-User:\n\n\u2022Pharmaceutical & Biotechnology Companies\n\n\u2022Hospitals and Reference Laboratories\n\n\u2022Academic & Research Institutes\n\n\n\nMarket Summary:\n\nRegion-wise, the market has been segmented into North America (the United States and Canada) Asia Pacific (China, Japan, India, South Korea, Australia, Indonesia and others), Europe (Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Italy, Russia and others), Middle East and Africa (Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and others ), and Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Columbia, Chile, Peru and others).
