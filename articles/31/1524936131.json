The acquisition, which cost approximately J$34.4 billion, was not completed at the reporting date with the financial results of SFC as of December 31, 2019, not yet available.\n\nJMMB's share of net assets and share of profits or gains arising on this acquisition will be reflected when the purchase price allocation is finalised, which is expected before March 31, 2020. Another significant milestone during the period under review was JMMB's first additional public share offering, the largest of its kind in Jamaica, which raised J$12.4 billion.\n\nThis funding strengthens the group's capital base and will be used to further facilitate the group's expansion and diversification strategy through acquisitions and adding new business lines.\n\nUPCOMING FOURTH QUARTER\n\nThe directors report that the upcoming fourth quarter January-March 2020 \u201cwill see a sharp focus on embedding our financial partnership model to better serve our clients and reap synergy benefits from operating from a \u201cOne Group, One Client, One Experience framework.\u201d\n\nIn his report Chief Executive Officer Keith Duncan pointed to another imperative for the fourth quarter, which is completing crucial operational efficiency projects to allow the banking business lines to operate on one core banking system while utilising standardised products, procedures, and policies across the group.\n\n\u201cDeepening our inorganic growth strategy as we explore accretive business development opportunities to grow our return on equity and expand our footprint,\u201d Duncan reported.\n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\nNet operating revenue for the period under review totalled J$17.38 billion, which represented a 26% growth or J$3.61 billion when compared to the comparable period last year. This mainly resulted from increases in net gains on securities trading, FX trading gains, fees and previous income and net interest income.\n\nNet gains on securities trading grew by 69% to J$5.64 billion and were partly due to improved appetite for emerging-market assets. Foreign exchange trading gains increased by 19 per cent or J$359.28 million to J$2.26 billion because of increased trading volume and growth in regional markets. Fees and commission income was 32 per cent higher at J$2.43 billion and was due to significant growth in managed funds and collective investment schemes across the group.\n\nNet interest income grew by 5 per cent to J$7.02 billion as there was strong growth in the loan and investment portfolios.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Local BusinessToday's Headlines"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jamaica Observer Limited"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Jamaica Money Market Brokers (JMMB) is projecting that its 2019 financials, when complete...", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"alexaVerifyID": "rSmiGOPEjbvIe54g6VDdjp7fxDQ", "google-site-verification": "yGWL0JARPWTYZuQO6SyybESnW5Tn5sn_mj5vRQhwZq8", "y_key": "b1206159d404874b", "msvalidate.01": "F356DE1E2BCA8CFA747B5120592BE455", "description": "Jamaica Money Market Brokers (JMMB) is projecting that its 2019 financials, when complete...", "keywords": "Local BusinessToday's Headlines", "og": {"title": "Jamaica Money Market Brokers expects best-ever year", "site_name": "Jamaica Observer", "image": "http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/JO/20200219/ARTICLE/302199986/AR/0/AR-302199986.jpg"}, "revisit-after": "1 days", "Author": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "DC.Subject": "Jamaica, Observer", "DC.Title": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "ROBOTS": "Follow,Index", "rating": "GENERAL", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@JamaicaObserver", "creator": "@JamaicaObserver", "title": "Jamaica Money Market Brokers expects best-ever year", "description": "Jamaica Money Market Brokers (JMMB) is projecting that its 2019 financials, when complete...", "image": "http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/JO/20200219/ARTICLE/302199986/AR/0/AR-302199986.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": ""}
