They were sentenced to 22 years in prison.\n\nIn his speech, U Aye Maung had said, \u201cBurmese people only think of Rakhine people as slaves and deny them equal rights. There are people going for armed revolution to get sovereignty and by taking advantage of political flaws. We need to get to our goals and change our mindset for self-government again.\u201d\n\nNationalists like the extremist monk U Wirathu and activist U Hla Swe were also prosecuted because of speeches they made under laws that human rights advocates see as curtailing free expression. They faced life imprisonment if found guilty.\n\nU Wirathu was charged because of his speeches at demonstrations against amendments to the 2008 Constitution. U Hla Swe was changed over his speeches at demonstrations supporting the military at Yangon City Hall. Officials said their speeches had defamed the government.\n\nBoth are still at large, have standing arrest warrants, and are considered fugitives from the law.\n\nIn Loikaw, the capital of Kayah State, six Karenni youths were sentenced to six months in prison for describing State Chief Minister U L Paung Sho and Kayah State Planning and Finance Minister as \u201cpolitical criminals and Karenni national betrayers\u201d during a protest against erecting a statue of independence hero Bogyoke Aung San in a park.\n\nIn Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin State, a judge sentenced two youth activists to 15 days in prison for holding a street performance to mark the eighth anniversary of the resumption of clashes in the strife-torn state. When one of the activists handed the judge a broken scale, he was given an additional three months in jail.\n\nU Myo Nyunt, NLD spokesperson, said that Myanmar\u2019s laws restricting freedom of expression are necessary to maintain law order in the country as it transitions to democracy.\n\nHe said that even though the NLD had fought military dictatorships for decades, it had to be careful when opposing laws implemented under the repressive regime.\n\n\u201cDemocratic countries face the inevitable problem of groups that have different opinions and violent protest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to manage them according to the law. Acts that violate the law are undemocratic.\u201d\n\nU Myo Nyunt said courts under the NLD-led government had been \u201crelatively lenient\u201d in sentencing those found guilty of breaking freedom of expression laws. Unlike previous regimes, the NLD-led government does not interfere in the judicial process, he said.\n\nThe Tatmadaw also charges people under freedom of expression laws, mostly \u2018section 505(a) sedition.\u2019\n\nBut advocates said they would not settle for anything less than total freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for the authorities of Myanmar to immediately repeal the laws that target and oppress peaceful activists and critics,\u201d said Nicholas Bequelin, Southeast Asia regional director for Amnesty International.\n\nThe Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) expressed concern about what it saw as the deterioration of freedom of speech and expression in Myanmar.\n\n\u201cThe climate of freedom of speech has terribly deteriorated and is now in critical condition,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nAAPP said there are 633 political prisoners in the country\u2019s prisons.\n\nAs of November this year, 80 people were jailed for political offences, 180 are facing trial while being detained in prison, and 373 are awaiting trial outside of prison, it said.\n\nFreedom of speech is one of the fundamental rights that strengthen democracy. Filing court cases against, and giving prison sentences to, activists, workers and civilians who express their views stunts the democratic process, the group said.\n\nHuman rights activists have demanded the amendment or repeal of laws that restrict freedom of speech and expression. But neither the government nor parliament have shown any sign of paying attention to the demands, as the two institutions struggle to seek a balance between individual freedom and collective responsibility. \u2013 Translated", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["ONE Championship"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "When Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy (NLD) swept the first free election in the country in over half a century in 2015, there was much optimism about the revival of democratic principles, especially freedom of speech and expression.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.mmtimes.com/sites/mmtimes.com/files/og-images-en/mmtimes_ios_57x57.jpg", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "MobileOptimized": "width", "description": "When Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy (NLD) swept the first free election in the country in over half a century in 2015, there was much optimism about the revival of democratic principles, especially freedom of speech and expression.", "HandheldFriendly": 1, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The Myanmar Times", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.mmtimes.com/news/freedom-speech-remains-elusive-under-nld-regime.html", "title": "Freedom of speech remains elusive under NLD regime", "description": "When Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy (NLD) swept the first free election in the country in over half a century in 2015, there was much optimism about the revival of democratic principles, especially freedom of speech and expression.", "image": "https://www.mmtimes.com/sites/mmtimes.com/files/news-images/nld_21.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.mmtimes.com/news/freedom-speech-remains-elusive-under-nld-regime.html"}
