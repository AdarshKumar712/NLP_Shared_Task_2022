The light horseman patrolling the beach. The surfboats fighting the waves to lay their wreaths. I had to capture this moment on canvas.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that the painting of a navy girl that emerging artist James Stickland met at the Mooloolaba Anzac Day Dawn Service last year was the third painting he ever done.\n\nBut after a lifetime of dreaming of becoming an artist, he picked up the skills very quickly \u2013 within a year \u2013 and his artwork has already featured in many exhibitions across the Sunshine Coast.\n\nStickland is a late bloomer when it comes to art, having found his passion at the age of 47.\n\nThe Warana-based artist said life \u201cgot in the way\u201d of dreams he made as a child.\n\nAnd with his two children now aged 21 and 19 and life getting a little stagnant, now was the time for change or \u201cforget about it\u201d.\n\nEMERGING ARTIST: James Stickland is a local artist who has created some amazing pieces.

It was set up with a mattress in the back, so I took advantage of my last four days of holidays and took my wife to Tweed Heads,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe accidentally found the Tweed Gallery, stopped in and admired the Margaret Olley exhibition.\n\n\u201cThis sparked an inner itch and after 26 years of sitting on a computer running a sign shop, kids grown up and not knowing what to do in life, I decided to enrol in a local art class and start my art career.\u201d\n\nThe Art School Co. in Buderim introduced him to many media and finally, he \u201cfound himself\u201d.\n\n\u201cI worked hard in different mediums, but my new-found love of oils prevailed and my chosen field \u2013 portraiture,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe joy of others entertained by my art is what pushes me forward as there are many down days where you question what you do.\u201d\n\nStickland is also exhibiting in the Cooroy Butter Factory Arts Centre, and earlier this year, he won the Emerging Art Award in the Kenilworth Art Prize.\n\n\u201cThe more I paint, the more I want to tell a story,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am currently enrolled in some short courses to further my skill and make 2020 a storytelling year of paintings.\u201d\n\nThe navy girl will be displayed at the Caloundra Regional Art Gallery as a finalist in the Sunshine Coast Local Artist, Local Content prize, which opens on January 17.\n\nTo follow Stickland\u2019s artistic journey, visit his Instagram @james_stickland_art.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["artists", "calolundra-regional-art-gallery", "paintings"], "tags": ["calolundra regional art gallery", "Read More", "artists", "paintings"], "authors": ["Lacee Froeschl", "Council News"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "An emerging artist who has only been dabbling in art for a year has wowed the community with his talents.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"description": "An emerging artist who has only been dabbling in art for a year has wowed the community with his talents.", "author": "Lacee Froeschl", "keywords": "artists, calolundra-regional-art-gallery, paintings", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"app_id": 143329145682245, "pages": 24945426253}, "og": {"site_name": "Sunshine Coast Daily", "title": "Emerging artist already wowing art world", "description": "An emerging artist who has only been dabbling in art for a year has wowed the community with his talents.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/01/02/v3imagesbin829be320e1cf64218578f3e6cb2a8184-911ybt9ws4zuo3aelt2_ct1880x930.jpg", "width": 1880, "height": 930}, "url": "https://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/emerging-artist-already-wowing-art-world/3913315/"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047077737, app-argument=sunshinecoastdaily://article?aid=3913315&type=article", "al": {"ios": {"url": "sunshinecoastdaily://article?aid=3913315&type=article", "app_store_id": 1047077737, "app_name": "Sunshine Coast Daily"}, "android": {"url": "sunshinecoastdaily://article?aid=3913315&type=article", "app_name": "Sunshine Coast Daily", "package": "com.apnarm.sunshinecoastdaily"}, "web": {"url": "https://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/emerging-artist-already-wowing-art-world/3913315/"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@the_daily", "title": "Emerging artist already wowing art world", "description": "An emerging artist who has only been dabbling in art for a year has wowed the community with his talents.", "image": "https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/01/02/v3imagesbin829be320e1cf64218578f3e6cb2a8184-911ybt9ws4zuo3aelt2_ct300x300.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=1020", "capi-id": "f3c85cb3f42415f50cf779012d23a97a", "article": {"content_tier": "locked"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/emerging-artist-already-wowing-art-world/3913315/"}
