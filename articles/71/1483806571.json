Nigerian workers under the leadership of the NLC will continue to work assiduously towards the promotion of national security, peace and unity.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to put the needed weight on the things that unite us and hold in contempt the things that seek to divide us.\n\n\u201cWe encourage our political leaders to exemplify the same by their utterances and conduct. By so doing, we will be laying an enduring foundation for national peace, unity, and development.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["New minimum wage", "NLC"], "authors": ["Fikayo Olowolagba"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has directed state councils to await directive to engage state governors who fail to meet the Dec. 31 deadline", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cropped-DAILY-POST-ICON-32x32.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has directed state councils to await directive to engage state governors who fail to meet the Dec. 31 deadline", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New Minimum Wage: NLC issues new directive as governors fail to meet deadline, reveals 2020 plans - Daily Post Nigeria", "description": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has directed state councils to await directive to engage state governors who fail to meet the Dec. 31 deadline", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2020/01/01/new-minimum-wage-nlc-issues-new-directive-as-governors-fail-to-meet-deadline-reveals-2020-plans/", "site_name": "Daily Post Nigeria", "image": {"identifier": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/wabba.jpg", "secure_url": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/wabba.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyPostNigeria/", "tag": "NLC", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T07:52:32+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 420332301344305}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has directed state councils to await directive to engage state governors who fail to meet the Dec. 31 deadline", "title": "New Minimum Wage: NLC issues new directive as governors fail to meet deadline, reveals 2020 plans - Daily Post Nigeria", "site": "@dailypostngr", "image": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/wabba.jpg", "creator": "@dailypostngr"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cropped-DAILY-POST-ICON-270x270.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://dailypost.ng/2020/01/01/new-minimum-wage-nlc-issues-new-directive-as-governors-fail-to-meet-deadline-reveals-2020-plans/"}
