We are following the lead of our city, state and federally elected officials, who have advised that large events be canceled or rescheduled.\n\nWe are working to notify everyone involved and plan to keep you up to date on any details we have regarding the new date for the event. As soon as we have a new date confirmed, we will notify you in hopes that you can still attend and join us for the celebration.\n\nThe Best of Cincinnati magazine will be going to press and printed on schedule and will be on newsstands and online March 25.\n\nWe appreciate your support of CityBeat Events and hope to see you soon.\n\nVisit our live blog for the latest COVID-19-related news, announcements, cancelations and other updates.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "As soon as there is a new date for the event, we'll let everyone know.
