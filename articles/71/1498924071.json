France seeks to get Iran back to the negotiating table, as opposed to the American strategy of increasing sanctions.Netanyahu also spoke of how far the Jewish people have come since the Holocaust.\u201cWe came out of the pits of death, established our state, brought it to the greatest decade in its history, and we are marching it towards additional unprecedented achievements,\u201d Netanyahu said, \u201cbut along this whole long journey, we will never forget our brothers and sisters who were killed in the Holocaust. We will ensure the eternity of Israel in their name and memory.\u201dNetanyahu mentioned that he and Putin will dedicate a new monument in Jerusalem\u2019s Sacher Park commemorating the Red Army fighters of World War II and the siege of Leningrad, now called Saint Petersburg.Approximately 70,000 Jewish fighters in the Red Army lost their lives in World War II.However, the Russian Embassy to Israel would confirm only that Putin is attending the event at Yad Vashem on Thursday.Putin may cut his trip to one day, shorter than originally planned, because of shakeups at home. His entire government resigned last week to facilitate major constitutional changes Putin proposed, which would allow himself to stay in power past the end of his fourth term in office in 2024.The Russian President is considering announcing during his visit that he will pardon Naama Issachar , the Israeli-American 26-year-old sentenced to over seven years in prison in Russia for allegedly possessing 9.5 grams of cannabis in her luggage while on a stopover in Moscow on her way from India to Israel.Netanyahu expressed hope in the cabinet meeting that he will \u201chear good news soon\u201d from Putin about Issachar.Macron plans to arrive in Israel on Tuesday night and stay until Thursday afternoon. While here, he plans to visit the Memorial to the Deportation of Jews from France near Bet Shemesh. The memorial is in a forest in the Elah Valley, which has 80,000 trees in memory of the 80,000 Jews deported from France in the Holocaust.In addition, the French President will meet with about 500 French-Israelis in an event organized by the CRIF, the umbrella organization of French Jewish organizations.Macron also has meetings with President Reuven Rivlin and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas scheduled for his visit.French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, who will be party of Macron's delegation to Israel, plans to visit the graves of nine victims of terrorist attacks in Paris who are buried in the Givat Shaul cemetery in Jerusalem.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The prime minister expressed hope that he will \u201chear good news soon\u201d from Putin about Naama Issachar, the Israeli-American 26-year-old sentenced to over seven years in prison in Russia", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/Icons/PNG/favicon-76.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The prime minister expressed hope that he will \u201chear good news soon\u201d from Putin about Naama Issachar, the Israeli-American 26-year-old sentenced to over seven years in prison in Russia", "fb": {"pages": 159050394216641, "app_id": 313311835670174}, "og": {"site_name": "The Jerusalem Post | JPost.com", "title": "Netanyahu to bring up Iran to leaders in town for Holocaust Forum", "type": "Article", "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/451630", "url": "https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Netanyahu-to-bring-up-Iran-to-leaders-in-town-for-Holocaust-Forum-614613", "description": "The prime minister expressed hope that he will \u201chear good news soon\u201d from Putin about Naama Issachar, the Israeli-American 26-year-old sentenced to over seven years in prison in Russia"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/451630", "url": "https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Netanyahu-to-bring-up-Iran-to-leaders-in-town-for-Holocaust-Forum-614613", "site": "Jerusalem_Post", "description": "The prime minister expressed hope that he will \u201chear good news soon\u201d from Putin about Naama Issachar, the Israeli-American 26-year-old sentenced to over seven years in prison in Russia", "title": "Netanyahu to bring up Iran to leaders in town for Holocaust Forum"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Netanyahu-to-bring-up-Iran-to-leaders-in-town-for-Holocaust-Forum-614613"}
