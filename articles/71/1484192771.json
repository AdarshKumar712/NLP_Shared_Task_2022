Three-out-of-four voters (73%) say Trump is unlikely to be forced out of the presidency, with 47% who feel it\u2019s Not At All Likely. Sixty percent (60%) of Democrats see Trump\u2019s removal from office as unlikely, although that compares to 81% of Republicans and 78% of voters not affiliated with either major political party. Predictably, 69% of Democrats say the bigger problem for pro-impeachment senators is Republican party loyalty, while a nearly identical number (67%) of GOP voters think the bigger roadblock is a lack of convincing evidence against Trump. Unaffiliateds are evenly divided.\n\nEight out of ten Democrats support Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal, and yet most still view the latter goal as dead on arrival in the Senate. Or to clarify, most correctly view impeachment as DOA in the Senate\u2026 assuming Pelosi ever submits the articles of impeachment.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 13:32:27 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "[dropcap]If[/dropcap] you think the impeachment circus that the Democrats have put on has been nothing more than one big waste of time doomed...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico?uc=1", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "[dropcap]If[/dropcap] you think the impeachment circus that the Democrats have put on has been nothing more than one big waste of time doomed...", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Most Democrats Who Support Impeachment Believe It Will Fail", "description": "Well they're right.", "url": "https://bongino.com/most-democrats-who-support-impeachment-believe-it-will-fail/", "site_name": "Dan Bongino", "image": {"identifier": "https://bongino.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1183983024.jpg", "secure_url": "https://bongino.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1183983024.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 728}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.bongino", "tag": "Senate", "section": "articles", "published_time": "2020-01-01T13:32:27+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Well they're right.", "title": "Most Democrats Who Support Impeachment Believe It Will Fail", "site": "@dbongino", "image": "https://bongino.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1183983024.jpg", "creator": "@dbongino"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://bongino.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/favicon.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://bongino.com/most-democrats-who-support-impeachment-believe-it-will-fail/"}
