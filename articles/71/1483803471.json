At the time of his death, he was still on a good behaviour bond, and he still holds the record as the oldest Australian to be arrested. When he was asked if he was worried about being sentenced to prison, his reply was: \u201cBring it on.\u201d William James Ryan was born in Sydney on St Patrick\u2019s Day, 1922 to Michael Patrick Ryan and Mary Elizabeth Ryan (nee Farrell). Ryan\u2019s view of the world was shaped by his childhood experiences of the Great Depression, and further by his experiences as a young man on the front line in World War II. The Depression years with his family meant sharing a single room in a boarding house in inner Sydney and regularly being required to relocate to new digs or to another boarding house. The family often wondered where their next meal would come from, and Ryan recalled the excitement of the very rare occasion when fresh fruit was available \u2013 an orange being a particularly rare delicacy. Ryan was a smart young man, but the poverty of the time meant he was unable to complete high school. Instead he went to work to provide additional income for the family.\n\nHe worked at a number of low-paid, unskilled jobs in his teens. Job security did not exist, and Ryan always remembered the small gestures of kindness made by employers and others that made a difference to his life. When Australia was drawn further into World War II in 1941, Ryan willingly signed up to fight for his country aged 19. He was assigned to the 36th Australian Infantry Battalion (known as \"Ike\u2019s Marines\"), and volunteered to be a forward scout on the front line. Bill Ryan during the Second World War. Ryan came up against the Japanese Imperial Army in the rugged and remote wilderness of the Kokoda Track, and then at the decisive Battle of Buna-Gona, described as \"a ghastly nightmare\" in Australian military history, and a turning point in World War II by war historians. Ryan was wounded in action, shot when advancing on an enemy machine-gun nest in thick jungle. He was evacuated to a makeshift field hospital in the New Guinea jungle, where he was offered the choice of receiving last rites from a priest or he could have a glass of water. \u201cI\u2019ll take the water,\u201d he replied weakly. He was patched up and returned to the front line, this time fighting the enemy in New Britain.\n\nHe was very lucky to return home from the war. Some of his mates didn\u2019t. He never forgot those brave souls and on a visit to The Australian War Memorial in Canberra two years ago was able to tell stories of each of them as their names were read to him from the bronze plaque in the Roll of Honour. Ryan returned home to Australia with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and malaria. But he was a fighter, and his intelligence and wit won him the attention of a feisty young woman. He had met his match and he courted and then married Joyce Lillian Ryan (nee Hilaire) shortly after the war in 1946. As was the practice of the day, veterans were offered positions in the public service after their war service. His sense of loyalty kept him in the public service, firstly in the Postmaster-General\u2019s Department, and then Telecom Australia until his retirement many years later. He settled down to family life, built a house in the southern suburbs of Sydney and had three sons with Joyce. He attended night school and completed his School Certificate, for the purpose of furthering his career and doing better for his family.

Rather than take up golf or fishing (as was recommended by a judge at one of his court sentencing hearings many years later), Ryan threw himself at helping people everywhere. This included Australian workers through his involvement in the union movement, supporting his local community, and welfare and justice for First Peoples. He also fought on global issues such as apartheid in South Africa, refugee recognition and support, and world hunger and education through his involvement with organisations including Oxfam, Medicines San Frontiers, Amnesty International and the Kokoda Track Foundation. He proudly supported and participated in the School Strike 4 Climate campaign. Joyce died in 2013, and he sought comfort by throwing himself even deeper into the protest movement, connecting with more activists and attending more events and participating in more non-violent direct-action protests. He used computer technology to access news, social media and email to stay in touch with world news and events. He used this knowledge to argue for change.\n\nHe shifted focus as the climate crisis escalated. He connected with more environmental groups including Greenpeace, Australian Conservation Foundation, The Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth and the Knitting Nannas. Despite blindness and limited mobility, Ryan travelled widely to support others concerned about humanity\u2019s future and the planet. His travels took him to all parts of Sydney and regional and rural communities including Newcastle, Boggabri, Gloucester and Canberra. Former Greens senator Lee Rhiannon said his passing was an enormous loss for the climate justice movement. \u201cHe has worked in ways that showed a very deep commitment to direct action ... many people have been inspired and worked harder for many causes because of Bill\u2019s work.\u201d He was quite bemused to be told that he had become somewhat of a poster boy for the environmental movement, but he took on the mantle. Despite being a quiet man, he put himself in front of microphones, cameras and the media. He seized the opportunity to use his ever-widening global recognition to inspire others to get involved, to take action and to hold governments to account. He was particularly pleased to see the younger generation getting involved and proudly supported and participated in the School Strike 4 Climate campaign. Greenpeace Australia Pacific campaigner Jonathan Moylan said: \"Bill Ryan was an absolute legend to all of us. And will go down in history as someone who never lost the determination to fight for a better world.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Phones", "Column 8", "Home tech", "Explainers", "Quizzes", "Environmental activism", "For subscribers", "Horoscopes", "Letters", "Obituaries", "Good Weekend", "Gadgets", "Editorial"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Asked if he was worried about being sentenced to prison, the Kokoda veteran said: \"Bring it on.\u201d", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicons/smh.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "theme-color": "#0A1633", "title": "Climate warrior, 97, was oldest Australian to be arrested", "description": "Asked if he was worried about being sentenced to prison, the Kokoda veteran said: \"Bring it on.\u201d", "article": {"section": "National", "published_time": "2019-12-31T03:29:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-12-31T03:29:13+00:00"}, "pubdate": "2019-12-31T03:29:13+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845, "pages": 1432569230378131}, "og": {"description": "Asked if he was worried about being sentenced to prison, the Kokoda veteran said: \"Bring it on.\u201d", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.771%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1047%2C$y_904/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/08c77cae1ae1ccedd6c85fd4f7162d075e0ea768", "width": 800, "height": 450, "secure_url": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.771%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1047%2C$y_904/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/08c77cae1ae1ccedd6c85fd4f7162d075e0ea768"}, "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "title": "Climate warrior, 97, was oldest Australian to be arrested", "url": "https://www.smh.com.au/national/climate-warrior-97-was-oldest-australian-to-be-arrested-20191231-p53nux.html"}, "parsely-title": "Climate warrior, 97, was oldest Australian to be arrested", "parsely-link": "https://www.smh.com.au/national/climate-warrior-97-was-oldest-australian-to-be-arrested-20191231-p53nux.html", "parsely-type": "Article", "parsely-image-url": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.771%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1047%2C$y_904/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/08c77cae1ae1ccedd6c85fd4f7162d075e0ea768", "parsely-section": "National", "parsely-pub-date": "2019-12-31T03:29:13+00:00", "parsely-tags": "OBITUARIES,environmental activism", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"article\",\"assetId\":\"p53nux\"}", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,index", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Asked if he was worried about being sentenced to prison, the Kokoda veteran said: \"Bring it on.\u201d", "image": {"src": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.771%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1047%2C$y_904/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/08c77cae1ae1ccedd6c85fd4f7162d075e0ea768"}, "site": "@smh", "title": "Climate warrior, 97, was oldest Australian to be arrested"}, "google-signin-client_id": "589384154045-p5vk6p2adh6l4p13n8rfjtbsfqu8gbn5.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.smh.com.au/national/climate-warrior-97-was-oldest-australian-to-be-arrested-20191231-p53nux.html"}
