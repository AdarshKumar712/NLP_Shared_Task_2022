Deadline reports that the series was initially set to premiere on April 12 but will now move to sometime \u201clater this year.\u201d\n\nThe article confirms that while World Beyond has finished filming its first season, post-production on the last few episodes has been disrupted by production shutdowns due to the current pandemic.\n\nWorld Beyond joins several other television shows and films in being halted or delayed over the coronavirus outbreak. Season four of the critically-acclaimed FX series, Fargo, was also slated for an April premiere date but will now be pushed back.\n\nAnother factor worth noting in the television network schedule is the lack of new content to air later this year. With so many shows shutting down their production, many networks will face a shortage of programming in the fall. AMC is making a smart business move by withholding World Beyond for later months when they may be short on content.\n\nAccording to Deadline, AMC and other ad-supported networks will also have to contend with major advertising companies restructuring their content because of unemployment, a plummeting stock market, and cross-cutting measures amid the health crisis. Networks will be more selective in ad spending, preferring to wait until later in the year to delegate rather than using it now.\n\nThe Walking Dead: World Beyond is moving its premiere date from Sunday April 12th to later this year.
