The former New York City mayor made clear in comments to reporters on Tuesday night that he\u2019s ready to pull out all the stops to defend his client\u2014and that apparently includes giving \u201clectures\u201d and doing \u201cdemonstrations.\u201d Asked if he would testify at the trial, Giuliani appeared unable to settle on a single, coherent answer.\n\n\u201cI would testify, I would, um, do demonstrations. I\u2019d give lectures, I\u2019d give summations. Or, I\u2019d do what I do best, I\u2019d try the case. I\u2019d love to try the case. Well I don\u2019t know if anybody would have the courage to give me the case, but, uh, if you give me the case, I will prosecute it as a racketeering case, which I kind of invented anyway,\u201d Giuliani said at a New Year\u2019s Eve gala at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nHe also dodged a question about whether he had any plans for another trip to Ukraine, an activity that has been at the center of the impeachment proceedings against Trump, which center on allegations he abused his power to pressure Ukraine to do him political favors. Giuliani, accused of hijacking American foreign policy to run a dirt-digging mission in Ukraine that would boost Trump domestically, returned from his latest trip earlier this month claiming to have boatloads of evidence to exonerate Trump and incriminate Trump's political foes, including former vice president Joe Biden and many Democrats.\n\nSo far, however, despite Trump claiming Giuliani would be filing a report with the Justice Department on his Ukraine findings and Giuliani saying he planned to brief the Senate on the matter, his findings have apparently not been embraced as the smoking gun against Democrats that he believed they would be. As The Daily Beast reported earlier this week, some Republican senators have actively avoided Giuliani ahead of the impeachment trial over concerns that his Ukraine findings may be mingled with Russian conspiracy theories. Even Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who first called on Giuliani to share his findings, has urged him to \u201cmake sure it\u2019s not Russian propaganda.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Donald J.
