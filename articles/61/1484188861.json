It was his 20th goal this season and his 200th career point. Guentzel had two assists earlier in the game.\n\nPatric Hornqvist had a goal and an assist, Dominik Simon scored, and Bryan Rust added two assists for Pittsburgh, which has won seven of its past eight and picked up its league-leading 16th home win.\n\nPenguins goalie Tristan Jarry made 24 saves to win his sixth straight start.\n\nNick Paul scored both goals for Ottawa, which saw the end of its five-game point streak (2-0-3).\n\nMarcus Hogberg stopped 28 of 33 Penguins shots.\n\nMalkin opened the scoring 27 seconds into the first period. On a two-on-one, he beat Hogberg glove-side with a wrist shot from the left circle.\n\nSimon doubled the Penguins' lead at 11:44 of the first. Joseph Blandisi won a puck battle with Chabot along the left-wing boards and threw it to the slot. Simon, fending off Paul, scored on a backhander.\n\nAt 4:21 of the second, Paul cut the deficit to 2-1. After a flurry of shots, Jarry was pulled to his left, leaving a big opening for Paul.\n\nMalkin struck again at 6:02 of the second, off a back-door play from Rust to restore the two-goal cushion.\n\nThe Senators again made it a one-goal game at 15:58 of the second. Paul was near the crease to pounce on the rebound of a shot by Connor Brown.\n\nPittsburgh answered 53 seconds later. Hornqvist \u2014 set up by John Marino after some nifty stickhandling, including a spin move \u2014 lifted a sharp-angle shot from the bottom of the left circle to make it 4-2.\n\nMalkin, deep in the Senators zone, set up Guentzel with a drop pass to make it 5-2 at 6:55 of the third.\n\nMENAFN3112201900670000ID1099494362", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["(MENAFN", "Gulf", "Times)", "Evgeni", "Malkin", "scored", "twice", "added", "assist", "Monday", "Pittsburgh", "Penguins", "their", "third", "straight", "over", "what is my ip", "SEO", "Real Estate", "what time is it", "free fire vs pubg", ""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"Description": "(MENAFN - Gulf Times) Evgeni Malkin scored twice and added an assist Monday as the Pittsburgh Penguins won their third straight, 5-2 over the visiting Ottawa Senators.\nThe win was tempered by an apparent right arm injury to Pittsburgh's leading scorer, Jake Guentzel, who earlier in the day was named to the All-Star Game.\nOn the same play he sc", "keywords": "(MENAFN, Gulf, Times), Evgeni, Malkin, scored, twice, added, assist, Monday, Pittsburgh, Penguins, their, third, straight, over, what is my ip ,SEO ,Real Estate ,what time is it ,free fire vs pubg ,", "news_keywords": "(MENAFN, Gulf, Times), Evgeni, Malkin, scored, twice, added, assist, Monday, Pittsburgh, Penguins, their, third, straight, over, what is my ip ,SEO ,Real Estate ,what time is it ,free fire vs pubg ,", "og": {"description": "(MENAFN - Gulf Times) Evgeni Malkin scored twice and added an assist Monday as the Pittsburgh Penguins won their third straight, 5-2 over the visiting Ottawa Senators.\nThe win was tempered by an apparent right arm injury to Pittsburgh's leading scorer, Jake Guentzel, who earlier in the day was named to the All-Star Game.\nOn the same play he sc", "title": "Qatar- Penguins rout Senators but lose Guentzel to injury", "type": "article", "url": "https://menafn.com/1099494362/Qatar-Penguins-rout-Senators-but-lose-Guentzel-to-injury", "image": {"identifier": "https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2019-12/31/GT_381bbd1c-9image_story.jpg", "width": 300}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@menafn", "id": 65910734}, "creator": {"identifier": "@menafn", "id": 65910734}, "description": "(MENAFN - Gulf Times) Evgeni Malkin scored twice and added an assist Monday as the Pittsburgh Penguins won their third straight, 5-2 over the visiting Ottawa Senators.\nThe win was tempered by an apparent right arm injury to Pittsburgh's leading scorer, Jake Guentzel, who earlier in the day was named to the All-Star Game.\nOn the same play he sc", "title": "Qatar- Penguins rout Senators but lose Guentzel to injury", "url": "https://menafn.com/1099494362/Qatar-Penguins-rout-Senators-but-lose-Guentzel-to-injury", "image": {"src": "https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2019-12/31/GT_381bbd1c-9image_story.jpg"}}, "author": "MENAFN", "resource-type": "document", "distribution": "global", "robots": "index, follow", "rating": "general", "y_key": "63f5d0c14b50c6c7", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "https://menafn.com/1099494362/Qatar-Penguins-rout-Senators-but-lose-Guentzel-to-injury"}
