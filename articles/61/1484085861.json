Also, the freedom of conscience and of religion implies the equality of various believers. This includes, among other things, the right to observe or not observe certain holidays, to participate or not to participate in certain events, based on one's own convictions ... Parents have the right to write complaints about officials' words and actions both to the Ministry of Education and to the Prosecutor's Office demanding to check the legality thereof,\" the lawyer told the \"Caucasian Knot\" correspondent.\n\nThis article was originally published on the Russian page of 24/7 Internet agency \u2018Caucasian Knot\u2019 on January 1, 2020 at 09:58 am MSK.
