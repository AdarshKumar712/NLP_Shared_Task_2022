The minister continues to defend diesel cars and is strictly against a speed limit on Germany\u2019s Autobahns, although the measure would reduce emissions.\n\nIn his draft national hydrogen strategy \u2014 which also mulls holding special tenders for offshore wind farms dedicated at the production of hydrogen \u2014 Altmaier explicitly included fossil-based hydrogen linked to carbon capture and storage (CCS).\n\n\u201cIn order to be able to achieve a rapid market ramp-up of hydrogen technologies for the decarbonisation of various areas of application, CO 2 -neutral (\"blue\") hydrogen will also have to play a role, above all for economic reasons,\u201d the draft seen by Recharge states.\n\nAccording to Handlesblatt, Norwegian oil major Equinor has been lobbying Berlin for months in favour of blue hydrogen derived from its natural gas.\n\nHowever, while green hydrogen production is a zero-carbon technology, blue H2 production is not. A maximum of 95% of the carbon can be captured when producing hydrogen from natural gas, and that is only when using the more expensive autothermal reforming (ATR) method, which is more expensive than the far more common steam methane reforming (SMR) process. There are also scientific doubts as to whether CO 2 stored in underground reservoirs will stay there forever, or what geological processes the technology could trigger.\n\nBesides, it is questionable whether building up a massive CCS infrastructure including specified vessels and pipelines to transport the climate-killing CO 2 would be worthwhile.\n\n\u201cWith the National Hydrogen Strategy we should think green, global and big,\u201d Karliczek said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe must not get bogged down with blue hydrogen and should instead concentrate on the question of how we can make green hydrogen successful and where we can get green hydrogen from.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether the little-known science minister or environment minister Schulze will be able to change the mind of Altmaier, who is a close confidant of Chancellor Angela Merkel and in charge of the main lines of Germany\u2019s Energiewende \u2014 its transition from nuclear and fossil fuel to renewable energy.\n\nLike Altmaier, Karliczek believes that Germany won\u2019t be able to meet all its future hydrogen needs through domestic production alone, and thinks the country will have to import most of it from abroad.\n\nThe government is already exploring opportunities for hydrogen production and the resulting supply chains in West African countries such as Ghana, the science minister said.\n\nThe economics and energy ministry couldn\u2019t tell Recharge when the draft of the hydrogen strategy will be voted on in the cabinet, nor whether Altmaier would be willing to compromise on the green v blue hydrogen question.\n\nAn environment ministry press official said negotiations between the ministries were ongoing, and stressed minister Schulze favours the use of green hydrogen in difficult-to-decarbonise industries such as steel making and chemicals over its use in transport.\n\nVoting on the hydrogen strategy as early as by the end of this month - as minister Altmaier hopes for - may be too ambitious, the press official thinks, but like the economics ministry couldn't tell either when the proposal would go to the cabinet.\n\nUPDATES to add environment ministry comment", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Americas", "Middle East & Africa", "Asia Pacific", "Policy", "In Depth", "Hydrogen", "Thought Leaders", "Europe"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Energy minister Altmaier includes blue hydrogen linked to CCS in its hydrogen strategy while the science and environment ministries favour green H2 only", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static-global.nhst.tech/resources/gfx/recharge/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "title": "Merkel cabinet split on green vs blue hydrogen dilemma | Recharge", "description": "Energy minister Altmaier includes blue hydrogen linked to CCS in its hydrogen strategy while the science and environment ministries favour green H2 only", "og": {"title": "Merkel cabinet split on green vs blue hydrogen dilemma | Recharge", "description": "Energy minister Altmaier includes blue hydrogen linked to CCS in its hydrogen strategy while the science and environment ministries favour green H2 only", "url": "https://www.rechargenews.com/transition/merkel-cabinet-split-on-green-vs-blue-hydrogen-dilemma/2-1-753114", "image": "https://images-global.nhst.tech/image/M3hhYjY4UUl1c3VuRFplcFZWZnpvUGRBVEJ2Z3FGYkdKTXpmdWd4akVqYz0=/nhst/binary/65b4bdec57ec74dada2d8176bbbe73f1?image_version=720", "type": "article", "site_name": "Recharge | Latest renewable energy news"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1547668972218679}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Merkel cabinet split on green vs blue hydrogen dilemma | Recharge", "description": "Energy minister Altmaier includes blue hydrogen linked to CCS in its hydrogen strategy while the science and environment ministries favour green H2 only", "image": "https://images-global.nhst.tech/image/M3hhYjY4UUl1c3VuRFplcFZWZnpvUGRBVEJ2Z3FGYkdKTXpmdWd4akVqYz0=/nhst/binary/65b4bdec57ec74dada2d8176bbbe73f1?image_version=720", "url": "https://www.rechargenews.com/transition/merkel-cabinet-split-on-green-vs-blue-hydrogen-dilemma/2-1-753114", "site": "@rechargenews", "creator": "@rechargenews"}, "referer": "origin"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.rechargenews.com/transition/merkel-cabinet-split-on-green-vs-blue-hydrogen-dilemma/2-1-753114"}
