This includes 2.02 trillion Baht from international tourists (up 3%) and 1.16 trillion Baht from domestic tourists (up 5%).\n\nThe outlook for 2020 follows the overall tourism situation in 2019, which is estimated to generate 3.06 trillion Baht (4% increase over 2018), comprising 1.96 trillion Baht (up 4%) from 39.77 million international tourists (also up 4%) and 1.10 trillion Baht (up 3%) from 167 million domestic trips (up 1%). Thailand welcomed the 39 millionth tourist on 27 December, 2019.\n\n\u201cTAT\u2019s target for 2020 is based on several favourable factors, ranging from the government\u2019s stimulus measures, TAT\u2019s focussed marketing strategies and promotions of emerging destinations, new air routes and the positive outlook of international tourists to Thailand from key source markets.\u201d Mr. Yuthasak Supasorn, TAT Governor\n\nThe Thai government has launched 16 tourism stimulus measures aimed at stimulating more inbound travel, including the opening of more VAT refund shops and counters, 24-hour cross-border tourism on the Thai-Malaysian and Thai-Lao borders during weekends and holidays, the e-visa service and exemption of the visa-on-arrival fee until 30 April, 2020, and the 50% discount on airport landing fees for international flights from 1 December, 2019, to 30 April, 2020, to name but a few.\n\nThailand is also seeing new air routes, including Hangzhou-Chiang Rai, Sendai-Bangkok, Munich-Phuket, and Doha-Chiang Mai.\n\nAt the same time, some emerging Thai destinations have become more popular among international tourists and gained global recognition. Buri Ram ranked third on Airbnb\u2019s list of 20 trending destinations to visit in 2020, while Sukhothai has been designated by UNESCO as a \u2018Creative City of Crafts and Folk Art\u2019.\n\nMr. Yuthasak said, \u201cLeveraging these favourable factors and gearing up to mark the 60th anniversary in 2020, TAT is committed to making travel and tourism the kingdom\u2019s most economically promising, environmentally sustainable, and culturally vibrant sector.\u201d\n\nTAT\u2019s marketing strategies also include the launch of \u201cThe MICHELIN Guide Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket & Phang Nga 2020.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, TAT is seeing a positive outlook of international tourists to Thailand from several markets including the CLMV countries (Cambodia, Lao PDR., Myanmar, and Vietnam), Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Spain, Eastern Europe, Israel and the US. The Chinese, Singaporean and Middle Eastern markets are showing signs of recovery. Meanwhile, the Japanese, Hong Kong, European, Scandinavian, Australian and Latin American markets are expected to remain stable or show a slow growth.\n\nMr. Yuthasak said, \u201cTAT is also preparing to overcome several challenges, including the effect from the China\u2013US trade war, the rise in consumption tax in Japan, and Brexit. The strong Thai Baht, Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, World Expo 2020 Dubai and stimulus visa schemes from country competitors have also been taken into consideration when laying out our tourism marketing strategies.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Blogger Thailand activity (9)", "China-Thailand relations (11)", "sports tourism (9)", "Thai Food (7)", "Thailand Travel Mart (12)", "Phuket (7)", "The Seasons (12)", "travel trade shows (13)", "Tourism Statistics (7)", "travel awards (19)", "Phuket Boat Incidents (29)", "Gastronomy Tourism (9)", "55 secondary cities (16)", "Awards and Accolades (56)", "Insight Thainess (8)", "cultural events (8)", "Chinese Market (10)", "responsible tourism (15)"], "authors": ["Tat Newsroom", "The Tat International Public Relations Division Works With Traditional", "Online Media Channels To Promote Thailand As A Tourism Destination For Travellers Worldwide."], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Bangkok, 27 December, 2019\u00a0\u2013 The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) is expecting 3.18 trillion Baht in overall tourism revenue for Thailand in 2020,", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i2.wp.com/www.tatnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cropped-favicon.png?fit=32%2C32&ssl=1", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "TAT targets 3.18 trillion Baht in tourism revenue for Thailand in 2020 - TAT Newsroom", "type": "article", "description": "Bangkok, 27 December, 2019\u00a0\u2013 The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) is expecting 3.18 trillion Baht", "url": "https://www.tatnews.org/2019/12/tat-targets-3-18-trillion-baht-in-tourism-revenue-for-thailand-in-2020/", "site_name": "TAT Newsroom", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.tatnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.18-trillion-Baht-FeatureImage.jpg?resize=780%2C470&ssl=1"}, "generator": "WordPress Download Manager 3.0.6", "description": "Bangkok, 27 December, 2019\u00a0\u2013 The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) is expecting 3.18 trillion Baht in overall tourism revenue for Thailand in 2020,", "theme-color": "#e9297b", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i2.wp.com/www.tatnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cropped-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.tatnews.org/2019/12/tat-targets-3-18-trillion-baht-in-tourism-revenue-for-thailand-in-2020/"}
