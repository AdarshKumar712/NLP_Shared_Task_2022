The official weather station is at the Leesburg International Airport. Due to the size and shape of Lake County, rainfall chances and temperatures can differ a few degrees from the official forecast.\n\nMelissa Watson, a weather service meteorologist in Melbourne, said the daybreak low on New Year\u2019s Day will be in the mid-40s, with a high in the upper 60s.\n\nOn Thursday, the forecast calls for a daybreak low in the lower 50s, with a high in the upper 70s. Then on Friday the rain chances will escalate as the day progresses. That rain will continue through early Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere is a 40% chance of rain on Friday,\u201d said Watson, adding the chances rise to 50% early Saturday as the front moves through.\n\nFriday\u2019s daybreak low temperature is expected to be in the mid-60s, with an afternoon high reaching the lower 80s. Though Saturday morning\u2019s daybreak low will be in the lower 60s, the afternoon high will only climb 10 degrees as the cold front moves through the area.\n\nOn Sunday, the daybreak low temperature will dip into the upper 40s, with the afternoon high only reaching the mid-60s. The good news is that there is no rain in Sunday\u2019s forecast.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Joe Callahan"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Commercial", "title": "Rain, cool temps expected this weekend", "description": "The National Weather Service in Melbourne predicts a 40% chance of rain late Friday and 50% early Saturday as a cold front moves through the area.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.dailycommercial.com/storyimage/LK/20200101/NEWS/200109969/AR/0/AR-200109969.jpg", "width": 2486, "height": 1500}, "type": "article"}, "msvalidate.01": "7E15F9269E2CE66F2A488ABB04B5015E", "bt": {"pubDate": "20200101T06:01:26Z", "modDate": "20200101T06:01:00Z", "keywords": "Community", "author": "Joe Callahan"}, "twitter": {"title": "Rain, cool temps expected this weekend", "description": "The National Weather Service in Melbourne predicts a 40% chance of rain late Friday and 50% early Saturday as a cold front moves through the area.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.dailycommercial.com/storyimage/LK/20200101/NEWS/200109969/AR/0/AR-200109969.jpg&MaxW=1200&MaxH=630", "site": "@DC__Sports"}, "author": "Joe Callahan", "vf": {"unique_id": "siteLK-pub2893-47E513A2-A8BD-46C8-AA39-F6723603FA78"}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20200101/rain-cool-temps-expected-this-weekend"}
