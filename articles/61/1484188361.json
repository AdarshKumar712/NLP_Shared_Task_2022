I had no clue what could even be in that box because it was so big.\u201d\n\nCleveland police later found in that container \u201clarge amounts of Amazon packages, envelopes and items torn open.\u201d\n\nThe witness added, \u201cIt was way too weird.\u201d\n\nA police report shows an Amazon manager told officers four containers had been stolen from the warehouse in Euclid. Containers just like the one found. The manager also said cameras record all vehicles picking up containers here. And, they get tracked by GPS.\n\nWhen the I-Team went to the distribution center, a man said no one there could answer questions for us.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson tells us the company is investigating.\n\nAnd another police report shows Amazon is conducting an internal review.\n\nEuclid Police Lt. Mitch Houser said, \u201cIt looks like a shipment of merchandise was stolen. CPD (Cleveland Police Department) recovered some of it, and we\u2019re working closely with the CPD to hopefully solve the crime.\u201d\n\nMany packages in the container that was found were addressed to places in Willoughby Hills.\n\nThat witness who had called police never expected what she saw to lead to an investigation like this. She said, \u201cIt was a huge box. It was just really quick.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["news", "amazon", "cleveland news", "iteam"], "tags": ["iteam", "cleveland news", "amazon"], "authors": ["Ed Gallek"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "(WJW) --- The FOX 8 I-Team has uncovered an investigation into large containers of packages stolen from Amazon.
