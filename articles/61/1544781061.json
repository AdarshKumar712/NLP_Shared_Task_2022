a strong indication of whether the patients were still contagious.\n\nThey found that viral shedding had typically stopped for most patients by day five of the infection in milder cases, although much of the spread would have taken place already by then.\n\nIn the most serious cases when patients had developed coronavirus-related pneumonia, they continued to display high levels of viral shedding until day 11.\n\nCoronavirus: How to protect yourself and others\n\nBut the researchers crucially found that with those who had only milder cases of coronavirus, they could not re-grow any virus cells from throat swabs of sputum specimens after the eighth day of the infection.\n\nIt takes five days for COVID-19 symptoms to show, according to a new major scientific study which measured how patients developed symptoms.\n\nScientists are warning that even if coronavirus transmissions dip as we head into the spring and summer, such a reduction shouldn't be mistaken for an end to the outbreak, which they expect to peak next winter.\n\nThe researchers in Berlin and Munich noted that this method of coronavirus spreading is very different from SARS, in which the shedding only took place later after the virus had already infected the lungs.\n\nBecause the coronavirus shedding is taking place in the throat, it is proving much harder to contain.\n\nPatients are shedding about 1,000 times more viral debris than they would have during the peak of the SARS outbreak, which in total resulted in 8,000 cases.\n\nThe researchers suggest that early self-isolation is appropriate.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["COVID-19", "Coronation Street", "coronavirus"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Viral shedding, the process of the virus cells replicating and spreading on, occurs more in the early days of infection.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/resources/favicon.png?v=1&bypass-service-worker", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=316391924", "description": "Viral shedding, the process of the virus cells replicating and spreading on, occurs more in the early days of infection.", "robots": "NOODP,INDEX,FOLLOW", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@skynews", "title": "Coronavirus could be most contagious before symptoms occur, study suggests", "description": "Viral shedding, the process of the virus cells replicating and spreading on, occurs more in the early days of infection.", "image": {"identifier": "https://e3.365dm.com/20/03/768x432/skynews-istock-cheek-swab-throat-swab_4944753.jpg?20200311110349", "alt": "Side close view of female doctor specialist with face mask holding buccal cotton swab and test tube ready to collect DNA from the cells on the inside of a woman patient.
