However, it said it \u201choped for a swift return to an environment conducive to resuming the positive co-operation.\u201c\n\n\u201cRecognizing that local staff is subject to local laws, the embassy is convinced that both sides will remain attentive to the working conditions and the well-being of all staff of diplomatic missions,\u201c it said.\n\nThe Swiss foreign ministry has previously called the alleged Nov. 25 abduction of the embassy employee a \u201cvery serious and unacceptable attack\u201d and summoned Sri Lanka\u2019s ambassador to demand an investigation. It also criticized a lack of due process in the case.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nThe Sri Lankan government has insisted that evidence collected by its investigators did not support the sequence of events provided by the embassy that the woman had been abducted by captors who demanded she reveal unspecified information about the embassy.\n\nSri Lanka also rejected a request by the embassy to fly the employee and her family to Switzerland.\n\nBefore the woman was detained, she was summoned to Sri Lanka\u2019s Criminal Investigations Department to make statements and was subjected to medical tests and a psychiatric analysis.\n\nSri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa later said he had become the victim in the alleged abduction because foreign media reported about it before the facts were established and critics accused his government of carrying it out.\n\nRajapaksa became president after winning a Nov. 16 election. Shortly after that, a Sri Lankan police investigator, Nishantha Silva, fled to Switzerland.\n\nGet more of the Star in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Star.

Some were returned after being tortured, while others were never seen again.
