active and working to fight the coronavirus.\n\nThey make prototypes of masks and visors; valves; devices for opening doors without using one's hands; and other medical equipment to supply hospitals that fear shortages.\n\nSince Sunday, dozens of Panthera Dental employees in Quebec have been hard at work manufacturing various prototypes of equipment designed to protect caregivers.\n\n\u201cWe understand the importance of the thing, something big is happening and we can help,\u201d said B\u00e9atrice Robichaud, co-founder of the company specializing in the manufacture of dental medicine products.\n\nPanthera Dental has around twenty 3D printers and as it is well known in the medical community, the company has received many requests related to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe federal government, the provincial government, hospitals in Quebec, and even hospitals in the United States called us to find out what we could do,\u201d said Robichaud. \u201cWhat sets us apart from other companies is that we already print medical equipment, so we can create sterilized and reusable products.\u201d\n\nShe said she has presented various prototype equipment to medical authorities, and that her company continues to research while waiting to see what type of equipment the authorities will need.\n\n\u201cThere is a global shortage of certain medical devices and each country is trying to produce for itself, so we cannot count on the others, we must be able to produce between our walls,\u201d she added.\n\nPublic health authorities have also contacted the 3D printing company Fablab to put its printers to work and help doctors.\n\n\u201cWe are part of an unofficial group, there is a network that has been formed with doctors and people from public health and we are discussing what is possible to manufacture,\u201d said Fablab production manager Vincent Charlebois.\n\nVoxel Factory, which is located in Montreal, sells professional 3D printers designed for businesses. Sales director Francois Lahey is also in contact with various hospitals.\n\n\u201cThere are currently discussions to know what the needs will be. It is important to wait for the authorities to tell us what they want, to properly meet the requirements of the medical staff,\u201d he said, adding that his company is one of the largest suppliers of 3D printers in Canada.\n\nSmall businesses that do 3D printing are also in demand. The Eric Par\u00e9 Photo Studio, which has a single 3D printer, was contacted by a doctor, who wanted to have a visor made to protect herself from the risks of contamination.\n\n\u201cIt's a doctor I know, so we printed a prototype and this doctor will present it to the medical staff where she works,\u201d said Christian Dion, an employee at the studio.\n\nThe improvised manufacturing of medical equipment involves health risks, but in France and in Italy, companies initiatives which mobilized to 3D print the material had great success. Some of these initiatives play an essential role in the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nThe Italian Minister for Technological Innovation Paola Pisano has also congratulated and publicly thanked entrepreneurs who have succeeded in creating respiratory valves thanks to 3D printing.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Mar. 24, 2020.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["montreal", "news", "montreal canadiens", "ctv news", "quebec", "breaking news", "canada", "canadian", "local news", "canadian news", "television", "weather", "traffic", "accident", "murder", "flood", "fire", "crash", "crime", "community", "sports", "advertising"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 24 21:48:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Across Quebec, 3D printing companies are active and working to fight the coronavirus.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//static.ctvnews.ca/bellmedia/ctvnews/img/fav-icons-2019/57x57-CTVNews-Icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Across Quebec, 3D printing companies are active and working to fight the coronavirus.", "keywords": "montreal, news, montreal canadiens, ctv news, quebec, breaking news, canada, canadian, local news, canadian news, television, weather, traffic, accident, murder, flood, fire, crash, crime, community, sports, advertising", "news_keywords": "covid-19, 3d printing, coronavirus, tech answers", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "fb": {"pages": 174761742563060}, "dc.date.modified": "2020-03-24", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Quebec's 3D printers are ready and willing to help fight COVID-19", "description": "Across Quebec, 3D printing companies are active and working to fight the coronavirus.", "url": "https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-s-3d-printers-are-ready-and-willing-to-help-fight-covid-19-1.4867041", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1172188.1361888792!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg", "site_name": "Montreal", "locale": "en_CA"}, "twitter": {"title": "Quebec's 3D printers are ready and willing to help fight COVID-19", "url": "https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-s-3d-printers-are-ready-and-willing-to-help-fight-covid-19-1.4867041", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Across Quebec, 3D printing companies are active and working to fight the coronavirus.", "site": "@CTVMontreal", "creator": "@CTVMontreal", "image": {"src": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1172188.1361888792!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg"}}, "author": "Staff", "article": {"author": "Staff", "published_time": "2020-03-24T21:48:00-04:00"}}, "canonical_link": "https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-s-3d-printers-are-ready-and-willing-to-help-fight-covid-19-1.4867041"}
