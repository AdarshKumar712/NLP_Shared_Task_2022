I pay particular tribute to Hajia Rabiat Bello, my beloved sister who passed on at 59 years of age on Monday, 23rd December, 2019 after a protracted illness. I pray the Almighty God to grant her and other deceased Kogites eternal rest.\n\n2019 will go down in history as the year in which we came together as a people like never before to break down the strong barriers of ethnicity, religion and class differentiation which divided us for so long and slowed our progress. These walls of partition were built and patronised in the past and engendered discrimination. They were used to make sure that a man\u2019s merit took a back seat to parochial and unprofitable considerations and were cogs in the wheels of our advancement as a state.\n\nThis is why our choices in the 2019 General Elections and in the November 16 Kogi State Gubernatorial Elections were direct answers to long-standing existential questions about the direction our state will take as we move into a rapidly changing future. The results of those elections were truly historic as they highlighted our collective commitment to pursue progress over conflict and unity instead of sectionalism.\n\nEven though my Administration has worked hard over the last 4 years to achieve this result, I still remain indebted to Kogites for making me the arrowhead of a new era in which Igala, Ebira, Okun and all the other ethnic nationalities in Kogi State proved that tribe, religion and class cannot be the worth of a man. Together, we heralded the New Kogi we want to bequeath to posterity as one characterised by equity and justice, unity, peace and progress. I solemnly promise to spend the next four years strengthening and advancing these precious values.\n\nThere is no doubt that 2020 is indeed a new beginning for us as a state and people. On the 27th day of January, 2020 I shall, by the grace of God, take the Oath of Office as the 5th Executive Governor of Kogi State, and begin a second term in Office. It shall remain the principal preoccupation of my new administration to bring revitalised energy to bear in delivering refocused governance in Kogi State for the next four years.\n\nOur administration through the help of God Almighty and your patience and support will continue to address all of the issues which bother you including insecurity, infrastructural decay, prompt payment of emoluments to civil servants, problems of unemployment, healthcare and education, among others. In our second term in office we are also going to pay greater attention to human capital development by investing more in training our people for enhanced relevance in a technologically evolving future.\n\nIt is therefore with gratitude to God that I once again welcome the good people of Kogi State to the year 2020. We undertake to do our very best to make it a most prosperous and progressive one for all of us by working hard and smart for you in government.\n\nHappy New Year.\n\nTo God be the Glory!\n\nYahaya Bello\n\nGovernor of Kogi State\n\nGovernment House\n\nLokoja.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 15:02:58 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "My Dear Kogites,\u00a0 It gives me great joy to welcome everyone to this New Year and I thank God Almighty for keeping us alive and healthy to witness it. 2020", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/logo.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "My Dear Kogites,\u00a0 It gives me great joy to welcome everyone to this New Year and I thank God Almighty for keeping us alive and healthy to witness it. 2020", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "2020: We'll do our best to make Kogi most prosperous, progressive \u2014 Gov Bello \u00bb Latest News \u00bb Tribune Online", "description": "My Dear Kogites,\u00a0 It gives me great joy to welcome everyone to this New Year and I thank God Almighty for keeping us alive and healthy to witness it. 2020", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/2020-well-do-our-best-to-make-kogi-most-prosperous-progressive-gov-bello/", "site_name": "Tribune Online", "image": {"identifier": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Yahaya-Bello4.jpg", "secure_url": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Yahaya-Bello4.jpg", "width": 450, "height": 350}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Tribuneonline/", "section": "Latest News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T15:02:58+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1050738235033475, "pages": 77912203638}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "My Dear Kogites,\u00a0 It gives me great joy to welcome everyone to this New Year and I thank God Almighty for keeping us alive and healthy to witness it. 2020", "title": "2020: We'll do our best to make Kogi most prosperous, progressive \u2014 Gov Bello \u00bb Latest News \u00bb Tribune Online", "site": "@nigeriantribune", "image": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Yahaya-Bello4.jpg", "creator": "@GhesheS"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/2020-well-do-our-best-to-make-kogi-most-prosperous-progressive-gov-bello/?ia_markup=1"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/logo.jpg", "numberOfItems": 3, "itemListOrder": "Ascending"}, "canonical_link": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/2020-well-do-our-best-to-make-kogi-most-prosperous-progressive-gov-bello/"}
