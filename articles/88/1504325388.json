a trado-medical practitioner, Alhaji Fatai Yusuf, popularly known as Oko Oloyun.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria reports that the convoy of the deceased was attacked on Thursday on the Igbo-Ora-Eruwa Road by gunmen who shot at them from a thick forest, with a bullet fatally injuring him.\n\nHe was said to have later died from the injuries caused by the bullet.\n\nA statement by the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, SP Olugbenga Fadeyi, hinted at a nexus between a fire incident in his Lagos office, ostensibly to cover up suspected fraud, and the attack.\n\nFadeyi said: \u201cThe report of Yusuf\u2019s death was received by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Igbo-ora that the two-car convoy of the deceased was allegedly ambushed shortly after passing through five different police stop and search teams along Igbo-Ora road by yet to be identified assailants who fired at the moving vehicles on the road from the thick forest.\n\n\u201cThe two-man armed escorts of policemen protecting the deceased engaged the assailants, but they managed to escape back into the forest after a single shot had hit the deceased who died later of his bullet injuries.\n\n\u201cAn interesting twist to the story was that the deceased had earlier detected an alleged book keeping records fraud in his Lagos office which subsequently allegedly led to the burning of some financial/book keeping records.\n\n\u201cSome of his staff and two police escorts are being questioned by a team of crack detectives from the homicide section of State Criminal Investigation Department( SCID), Iyaganku, Ibadan, with a view of finding and apprehending the fleeing suspects who committed the heinous act.\u201d\n\nFadeyi said the police in the state were working with other police formations and units to ensure that the directive of the Inspector General of Police, Muhammed Adamu, to unravel the killers was complied with.\n\nThe spokesman also said the Commissioner of Police in the state, Shina Olukolu, had promised to bring the culprits to justice within the shortest possible time.\n\nFadeyi said Olukolu, however, appealed to members of the public with credible information not to hesitate in passing it to the police to assist it in the apprehension of the assailants.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Shina Olukolu", "Olugbenga Fadeyi", "Oko Oloyun", "Oyo State Police
