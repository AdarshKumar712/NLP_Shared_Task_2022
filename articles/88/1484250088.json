Source: Facebook/ Traffic and Highway Patrol Command - NSW Police Force More\n\nThe male driver lost his licence after he was slapped with 30 demerit points \u2013 double the amount the five offences for unrestrained passengers would normally incur due to the Christmas and New Year double-demerit period.\n\nThe double-demerit period ended for NSW motorists at midnight on Wednesday.\n\nThe driver was also hit with a fine of $1720, while the woman received a fine of $344.\n\nThe man had asked officers to be let off with a warning for the offences.\n\nAlternative transport was arranged for the extra passengers.\n\nPolice shared an image of the passengers inside the vehicle on Facebook, prompting comments of disbelief.\n\n\u201cTotally irresponsible driver and to ask to be given a warning, you gotta be kidding,\u201d one person wrote.\n\n\u201cWhy do people think this is OK?\u201d another asked.\n\nIt comes just days after a driver in Newcastle also lost their licence for a similar scenario.\n\nInside the rear of his vehicle were three children aged 1, 3 and 4 without the required child seats.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
