resolved to work together to explore possibilities of reviving the traditional political partnership between the two regions ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nIn a communique jointly presented to the press and signed by the coordinator Northern Emancipation Network, Abdul \u2013 Azeez Suleiman, and a leader of the Niger Delta Congress, Comrade Davies Opiri McLean at the end of its two days consultation meeting, Wednesday, at the famous Munbaiya House, Kano revealed that the groups discussed matters of mutual interest, the economy, growing communal distrust, current security situation, environmental issues, possible alignments in build-up to, and conduct of the 2023 elections and other matters related to the position of the two regions.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 reads in parts: \u201cIn the light of the building apprehension with regards to the elections, the meeting \u2018resolved to mobilize all politicians to develop the highest levels of tolerance and a recommitment to respect the will of the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cThe meeting resolved to work together to explore possibilities of reviving the traditional political partnership between the two regions that thrived during previous republics, and to marshall support for a generational shift of power.\n\n\u201cThe meeting recalled the understanding between the Northern Peoples Congress and the Niger Delta Congress which was one of the political parties in Nigeria\u2019s First Republic that generated tremendous support from most communities in the Eastern Region.\n\n\u201cThis meeting, therefore, resolved to consult further on the possibility of reviving this alliance that thrived throughout the first, second and third republics, and extended well into the current republic.\n\n\u201cThe meeting also agreed to device ways of taking comfortable advantage of the window provided by the \u201cNot too Young to Run\u201d act in order to achieve a smooth intergenerational transfer of power.\n\n\u201cThe meeting observed that in view of widespread criticism against the existing federal arrangement, the need may arise for a national dialogue to holistically and sincerely discuss Nigeria before the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThe meeting agreed to work together to ensure that the composition of the delegation to any futur\u00e9 conference should genuinely represent a serious commitment to holistically addressing the complex problems of the nation, without violating any of the principles of justice, fairness, inclusiveness and equity.\n\n\u201cIt noted that any discussion for the future of Nigeria must demand that the obvious imbalance in representation between geo-political zones, age and gender interests be redressed to ensure that issues which may further threaten our peace, security, harmonious co-existence, or which may offend the provisions of the Constitution are avoided.\n\n\u201cThe meeting decried the failure by concerned bodies to implement past reports and recommendations on environmental rehabilitation and noted that the current levels of anger and hopelessness among the victim populations are alienating entire communities from government.\n\n\u201cThe meeting expressed sympathy with communities affected by environmental degradation and in particular, called on community leaders in the Niger Delta to work hard to expose those forces behind alleged connivance -to deprive the region.\n\n\u201cThe meeting expressed major concerns over the seeming reluctance of authorities to commit more to the protection of the lives and properties of citizens.\n\n\u201cWhile noting that a certain degree of success with the Boko Haram fight is noticeable with the coming of this administration, the meeting however lamented that the shocking level of audacity with which insurgents, bandits, robbers and kidnappers still attack and kill on highways, destroy towns and villages and commit unspeakable atrocities, calls to question the sustainability of the successes. \u2018\n\n\u201cThe meeting resolved to demand that government improves its willingness to protect citizens all over the country especially in the North East and many other parts of the North\u201d.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["2023 elections"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 15:16:25 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "",
