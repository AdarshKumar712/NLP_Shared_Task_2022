Zomato last week announced it has acquired rival Uber Eats food delivery business in India in an all-stock deal of nearly $350 million and Uber will have 9.99 percent stake in the Deepinder Goyal-led food delivery platform.\n\nThe Google-BCG report also suggested that consumers have common impediments that hinder adoption.\n\nA fifth of the respondents stated a lack of trust in the app as the main barrier to usage.\n\nDelivery charges (18 percent), food quality concerns (13 percent) and lack of customisation (10 percent) are other reasons why customers have, so far, not experimented with online food ordering.\n\n\"Interestingly, these observations vary based on the maturity of the market. While delivery charges is the top reason for not ordering food online in metro cities; in Tier I cities, lack of trust in apps (29 percent) is the primary roadblock,\" the findings showed.\n\n\"Food tech startups have revolutionised the way Indians eat. Ordering food online is now a habit. There is large headroom to increase reach, engagement and usage frequency for food tech apps,\" said Abheek Singhi, Senior Partner and Managing Director at Boston Consulting Group.\n\nEditor's note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the market would reach $8 billion by 2020.
