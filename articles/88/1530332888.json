Both sides have seven days to meet and vote on whether to accept the mediator\u2019s recommendations. Both parties declined to share specifics from the report.\n\n\n\nMelissa Baker, an Ashland High School Spanish teacher and the president of the teachers association, said the union plans to meet Thursday after school to vote.\n\n\n\n\"I\u2019m pleasantly surprised that [the board] acted and approved the fact-finder\u2019s report,\" Baker said. \"I think [the fact-finder\u2019s report is] pretty fair in both sides\u2019 favor. There were some things that we asked for on our side that were granted to us and there were some things the board asked for that were granted to them.\"\n\n\n\nAshland teachers have been working without a contract since June. Negotiations stalled in part because Ashland City teachers say they have not received a raise in their base salaries in nine years. The district is continuing to operate under an expired collective bargaining agreement.\n\n\n\n\"Negotiations are a give and take and the number one thing for us is our kids win because we\u2019re going back to seven and half-hour days,\" said Superintendent Doug Marrah. \"Our teachers spend that time helping the kids, lesson planning\u2026\"\n\n\n\nIn the last few years, Ashland teachers were paid a few thousand dollars stipend for working a seven-hour, 30-minute workday. This school year, while working without a contract, the teachers worked 25 minutes less each day and did not receive the stipend, which last year was $5,000.\n\n\n\nAlso at Monday's meeting, Marrah recognized the staff of Taft Intermediate School for receiving an Outstanding Achievement award from the Ohio State Senate in the fall.\n\n\n\n\"There's no secret: it's always about amazing teachers that are going to work hard and go the extra mile for kids,\" said Taft Principal Stephen McDonnell.\n\n\n\nTaft Intermediate School received an A grade in September from the Ohio Department of Education.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Staff writer Jordan Laird can be reached at 419-281-0581 ext. 240 or jlaird@times-gazette.com.
