Join the Rush The Kop team! Write for us!\n\nChelsea have their beady eye on the League Two starlet, who has made his breakthrough this season and played 10 games for the Cumbrians.\n\nThe report indicates that Carlisle bosses are resigned to losing Jarrad Branthwaite this winter, although it doesn\u2019t specify the fee. He isn\u2019t even given a valuation by Transfermarkt, the normally reliable website, although you wouldn\u2019t imagine it would take an extortionate offer to sign the youngster.\n\nLiverpool are well stocked in their defensive youth ranks with Ki-Jana Hoever making his first team debut and impressing, while Sepp van den Berg joined in the summer after doing well for Zwolle in the Eredivisie.\n\nIt seems to mark an indication of how the club will continue their activity in the market. They are looking for young players with potential to improve, who can play a back-up role to those established first team regulars.\n\nMax Clark would come in as Robertson\u2019s understudy, Takumi Minamino will operate as a versatile forward across the front three in order to relieve the pressure on Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah while Branthwaite will be regarded as one for the future.\n\nThese are exciting times to be a Liverpool fan, and the January transfer window is only going to increase the anticipation for what\u2019s to come.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Russell Hughes", "David Gate", "Paul Kasabian"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A 17-year-old Liverpool transfer target is expected to move in January amid interest from Premier League rivals Chelsea.
