It wants protections of environmental standards and labour rights to be part of the deal, to avoid British industry undercutting EU competitors.\n\nMr Frost said such commitments would bind Britain to EU laws and standards in a way that is unprecedented in other free trade agreements.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to understand why the EU insists on an ideological approach which makes it more difficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. We very much need a change in EU approach for the next round beginning on June 1st. In order to facilitate those discussions, we intend to make public all the UK draft legal texts during next week so that the EU\u2019s member states and interested observers can see our approach in detail,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth sides agreed that there had been slight movement on the issue of fisheries, where each had begun with polar opposite positions, the EU advocating for a continuance of the status quo and Britain insisting it would reclaim exclusive rights for its fishing industry alone in its territorial waters.\n\nTalks on finding a compromise will resume in the next round of negotiations, which begin on June 1st.\n\nBritain will next week publish the draft legal texts it has shared with EU negotiators but not with member-state governments. It will also publish a document outlining how it plans to implement the Northern Ireland protocol.\n\n\u2018A bit tetchy\u2019\n\nA senior British official close to the negotiations said this week\u2019s talks were \u201ca bit tetchy at times\u201d, adding that Mr Barnier was doing a good job but was burdened with a negotiating mandate that was not negotiable with Britain.\n\n\u201cThe problem continues to be that the EU think that they can get a halfway house between what we\u2019re willing to see on so-called level playing field and what they\u2019re willing to see, what we\u2019re willing to live with on fisheries and what they\u2019re wanting to see. We tried to make clear from the start that there isn\u2019t a halfway house. You can\u2019t split the difference between areas where we control our own laws and that\u2019s a fundamental difficulty that the EU has not yet accepted,\u201d the official said.\n\nAfter weeks of stalemate and a tight negotiating timetable that was curtailed further by the coronavirus pandemic, calls have grown for Britain to request an extension to the transition period to give the talks more time, which survey data indicates has majority public support.\n\nThe British Irish chamber of commerce appealed to the government of prime minister Boris Johnson to buy time so that businesses were not burdened with tariffs and regulations while at their \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d.\n\nThe British government has insisted it will not ask for an extension, and last week cabinet minister Michael Gove said that tariffs were a \u201cprice\u201d London was willing to pay.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Both sides say little progress made in this week\u2019s talks with crunch time approaching", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/assets/images/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "Both sides say little progress made in this week\u2019s talks with crunch time approaching", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14254498"}, "news_keywords": "News, World, Europe, Brexit, Michael Gove, Michel Barnier, David Frost, Boris Johnson, British Government, World Trade Organization, Eu, European Union, Ireland, United Kingdom", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "Michel Barnier \u2018not optimistic\u2019 deal can be reached with UK", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/michel-barnier-not-optimistic-deal-can-be-reached-with-uk-1.4254498", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "Both sides say little progress made in this week\u2019s talks with crunch time approaching", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4254497&origw=1440", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4254497&origw=1440", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimesWorld", "creator": "@naomiohreally", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/michel-barnier-not-optimistic-deal-can-be-reached-with-uk-1.4254498", "title": "Michel Barnier \u2018not optimistic\u2019 deal can be reached with UK", "description": "Both sides say little progress made in this week\u2019s talks with crunch time approaching", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4254497.1589554908!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/michel-barnier-not-optimistic-deal-can-be-reached-with-uk-1.4254498"}
