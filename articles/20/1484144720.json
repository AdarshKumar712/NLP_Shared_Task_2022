This is not a Warning, it is a Threat.\"\n\nBut Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded by tweeting that the US \"can't do anything.\"\n\n\"If you were logical -- which you're not -- you'd see that your crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan... have made nations hate you,\" Khamenei added.\n\nEyewitnesses also told CNN that local law enforcement forces around the embassy had not been seen doing anything significant to stop the protestors demonstrating in front of the compound, or from throwing stones at it.\n\nThe airstrikes and ensuing protests come at a time of high tension between the US and Iran, and have stoked fears of a new proxy war in the Middle East .\n\nUS sends extra forces to protect embassy\n\nIn the wake of Tuesday's attack on the US Embassy, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the US would send approximately 750 soldiers to the Middle East.\n\n\"This deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against US personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad today,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"The United States will protect our people and interests anywhere they are found around the world,\" Esper added.\n\nTrump insisted in a tweet Tuesday that the embassy was safe. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also told Fox News that there are currently no plans to evacuate the embassy or pull US troops out.\n\nThe weekend's airstrikes have strained relations between Washington and Baghdad. Iraqi officials accuse the US of attacking without sufficient evidence, of violating Iraqi sovereignty and of threatening the country's security.\n\nThe embassy posted on its website that it would remain closed until further notice. It also advised that U.S. citizens not travel to Iraq, and advised anyone in the area to stay away from the embassy.\n\nThe militia targeted by US airstrikes\n\nThe Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah is militantly anti-American. In 2017 and 2018, its fighters in Syria tried to attack the US-supported garrison at al-Tanf on the Iraqi border.\n\nIt has provided hundreds of fighters for the Assad regime in Syria -- part of a broader Iranian effort to help stamp out the insurgency there -- and is an important element in Iranian efforts to extend its influence through northern Iraq and into Syria. The US strikes, notably, were against targets along the main route between Iran and Syria.\n\nA spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah told CNN that the embassy protests were only a \"first step.\"\n\n\"The American administration should understand the following: the first step was to protest near the American embassy, we are waiting their reactions to determine the second step,\" Mohamad Mouhiye said, calling for the US to shut down the embassy and withdraw from Iraq.\n\n\"First, close the doors of the evil embassy, which we consider a spy building and an operations room to administer and sabotage Iraq's well-being,\" Mouhiye said. \"We also call on the US to withdraw their military forces which are in Iraq illegally.\"\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["embassy in iraq", "embassy siege", "attack on embassy", "iraq", "embassy", "us embassy in iraq"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 16:45:49 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Iraqi security forces have regained control of the area around the US Embassy in Baghdad after the compound was rocked by a second day of mass protests.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Iraqi security forces have regained control of the area around the US Embassy in Baghdad after the compound was rocked by a second day of mass protests.", "keywords": "embassy in iraq,embassy siege,attack on embassy,iraq,embassy,us embassy in iraq", "brightspot.contentId": "0000016f-61ff-d82e-a3ff-7bffd2d70000", "og": {"title": "Siege of U.S. embassy in Iraq ends", "url": "https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/national/siege-of-u-s-embassy-in-iraq-ends-after-iraqi-forces-secure-area", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a3d3fc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1000x525+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fcf%2Faa%2F0b20996847559bfd1de3bdd520df%2Fs118661616.JPG", "url": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a3d3fc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1000x525+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fcf%2Faa%2F0b20996847559bfd1de3bdd520df%2Fs118661616.JPG", "secure_url": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a3d3fc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1000x525+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fcf%2Faa%2F0b20996847559bfd1de3bdd520df%2Fs118661616.JPG", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/png", "alt": "Siege of U.S. embassy in Iraq ends after Iraqi forces secure area"}, "description": "Iraqi security forces have regained control of the area around the US Embassy in Baghdad after the compound was rocked by a second day of mass protests.", "site_name": "WEWS", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T16:45:49", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T17:31:04", "section": "National News", "tag": "National"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Iraqi security forces have regained control of the area around the US Embassy in Baghdad after the compound was rocked by a second day of mass protests.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a3d3fc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1000x525+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fcf%2Faa%2F0b20996847559bfd1de3bdd520df%2Fs118661616.JPG", "alt": "Siege of U.S. embassy in Iraq ends after Iraqi forces secure area"}, "site": "@WEWS", "title": "Siege of U.S. embassy in Iraq ends"}, "fb": {"app_id": 117981068372285}, "brightspot.cached": "true", "google-site-verification": "clMVQNEwqi_J60as0ThHN4U-_zIv_gghfAQAL9uuZzo"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/national/siege-of-u-s-embassy-in-iraq-ends-after-iraqi-forces-secure-area"}
