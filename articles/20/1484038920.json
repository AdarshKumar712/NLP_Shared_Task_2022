Phil Gavin spoke to the media and said there had been an altercation prior to the officers firing their weapons.\n\nA neighbour who lives across the street from the victim told CHCH News he was sitting in his car when he saw the police cruisers come rushing down the street.\n\n\u201cMy neighbour, who I\u2019ve met a couple of times, was walking up his driveway with his hands out at his sides,\u201d said Duke Willis. \u201cThe guy took maybe four or five steps and the cops pulled their guns and shot him three times- bang, bang, bang! He hit the ground, bang! A fourth shot in the back.\u201d\n\nWilson says he believes his neighbour suffers from some \u201cpsychological issues.\u201d He said the 56-year-old man lived at home with his retired mother.\n\nThe SIU has assigned five investigators and three forensic investigators to look into the incident. \u201cAt this time, two subject officers and three witness officers have been designated,\u201d said the SIU in a news release.\n\nThe SIU is an arm\u2019s length agency that investigates reports involving police where there has been death, serious injury or allegations of sexual assault.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["police", "st catharines", "special investigations unit", "shooting", "niagara regional police service", "siu", "niagara", "police shooting"], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Ontario\u2019s police watchdog is investigating after a 56-year-old man was shot by two Niagara Regional Police Service officers in St. Catharines.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.chch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chch_logo_web.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.chch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/St.-Catharines-SIU-shooting.png"}, "description": "Ontario\u2019s police watchdog is investigating after a 56-year-old man was shot by two Niagara Regional Police Service officers in St. Catharines.", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Ontario\u2019s police watchdog is investigating after a 56-year-old man was shot by two Niagara Regional Police Service officers in St. Catharines.", "title": "Man seriously injured after being shot by two Niagara cops | CHCH News", "site": "@chchnews", "image": "https://www.chch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/St.-Catharines-SIU-shooting.png", "creator": "@chchnews"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.chch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chch_logo_web.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.chch.com/man-seriously-injured-after-being-shot-by-two-niagara-police-officers/"}
