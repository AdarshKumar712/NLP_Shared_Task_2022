Including myself I was on duty the whole night so we were around there, the response by the police, it was reasonable because we did have police officers around that particular vicinity all of us we were on duty.\u201d\n\nWatch related videos below:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Elias Mawela", "New Years Eve", "2020", "Melville", "Police"], "authors": ["Celestine Hendricks"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 09:15:57 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Mawela says law enforcement officials were out in their numbers on New Year\u2019s Eve and it was an extremely busy night.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/wp-content/themes/sabcnews/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "gCibvUv7H6HwT4yzAs_7HJwWERwfBU1EH03cm4xodpk", "description": "Mawela says law enforcement officials were out in their numbers on New Year\u2019s Eve and it was an extremely busy night.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mawela refutes claims that police did not move swiftly in Melville shooting - SABC News - Breaking news, special reports, world, business, sport coverage of all South African current events.
