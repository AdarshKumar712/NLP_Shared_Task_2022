(Photo by TF-Images/Getty Images)\n\nPhilippe Coutinho would be an ideal replacement for Christian Eriksen at Tottenham, but there\u2019s no way Spurs will pay Barcelona\u2019s asking price.\n\nIn a perfect world, Tottenham would be able to replace Christian Eriksen with an established star this January. Philippe Coutinho absolutely would fit the bill. Unfortunately for Spurs, Spanish reports linking the Brazilian live wire with a sensational move to North London are purely a ploy by Barcelona officials to drive his transfer value through the roof.\n\nEldesmarque regards Barcelona selling Coutinho for a small fortune as the key to the La Liga giants\u2019 hopes of bringing Neymar back to Spain. To that end, Barcelona are asking a number of Premier League clubs to pay upwards of \u00a3100 million to secure his services next summer.\n\nChelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham are the three English clubs mentioned by name in the Spanish publication. To put it bluntly, one of these clubs is not like the other when it comes to transfer dealings. Spurs have never spent anything close to \u00a3100 million on a single player. The chances of them doing so while paying for a state-of-the-art new stadium are almost non-existent.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that Barcelona officials are desperate to keep Coutinho\u2019s transfer stock at its zenith. It\u2019s hard to call his time in Spain anything other than a flop. He failed to show the sparkling attacking characteristics that made him a star at Liverpool during his brief time on the pitch with Lionel Messi and his star-studded team.\n\nFortunately for Barcelona, his time at Bayern Munich does seem to be going better than his cameos in Spain. He hasn\u2019t fully regained the stardom he enjoyed at Anfield, but he\u2019s been an important cog for the German giants. They might like to retain him for tactical reasons, but it\u2019s highly unlikely Bayern will stump the fee required to acquire him on a permanent basis.\n\nAs such, it\u2019s imperative for Barcelona officials to keep big Premier League clubs interested in Coutinho\u2019s services. Tottenham are never going to win the race for the talented No. 10, but their \u201cinclusion\u201d in the bidding will help push clubs like Chelsea or Manchester United to bid against themselves. That\u2019s the game Barcelona are playing here. Spurs will not be a real factor for Coutinho this summer.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Bence Bocsak", "Kian Long", "Rucker Haringey", "Matt Jones", "Durim Halimi"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Philippe Coutinho would be an ideal replacement for Christian Eriksen at Tottenham, but there's no way Spurs will pay Barcelona's asking price.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://playingfor90.com/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Philippe Coutinho would be an ideal replacement for Christian Eriksen at Tottenham, but there's no way Spurs will pay Barcelona's asking price.", "DC.date.issued": "2019-12-31T04:00:12-05:00", "generator": "WordPress 4.9.13", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@playingfor90", "title": "Tottenham are being used by Barcelona and Philippe Coutinho", "description": "Philippe Coutinho would be an ideal replacement for Christian Eriksen at Tottenham, but there's no way Spurs will pay Barcelona's asking price.\u00a0 In a perf...", "creator": "@RuckerHaringey", "image": {"src": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https://playingfor90.com/wp-content/uploads/getty-images/2016/04/1190051246.jpeg&"}, "domain": "https://playingfor90.com", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "Playing for 90", "ipad": "Playing for 90", "googleplay": "Playing for 90"}, "id": {"iphone": 1253151007, "ipad": 1253151007, "googleplay": "com.fansided.playingforninety"}}}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Tottenham are being used by Barcelona and Philippe Coutinho", "url": "https://playingfor90.com/2019/12/31/tottenham-used-barcelona-philippe-coutinho/", "image": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https://playingfor90.com/wp-content/uploads/getty-images/2016/04/1190051246.jpeg&", "site_name": "Playing for 90", "description": "Philippe Coutinho would be an ideal replacement for Christian Eriksen at Tottenham, but there's no way Spurs will pay Barcelona's asking price.\u00a0 In a perf..."}, "fb": {"admins": "10105391,1369422511"}, "article": {"author": "https://playingfor90.com/author/ruckerharingey/", "published_time": "2019-12-31T04:00:12+00:00"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "fansided://playingfor90.com/2019/12/31/tottenham-used-barcelona-philippe-coutinho/app/", "app_store_id": 1253151007, "app_name": "Playing for 90"}, "android": {"url": "fansided://playingfor90.com/2019/12/31/tottenham-used-barcelona-philippe-coutinho/app/", "app_name": "Playing for 90", "package": "com.fansided.playingforninety"}, "web": {"url": "https://playingfor90.com/2019/12/31/tottenham-used-barcelona-philippe-coutinho/"}}, "theme-color": "#998776", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msapplication-config": "none", "application-name": "Playing for 90", "msapplication-TileColor": "#998776", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#cccccc", "msapplication-tooltip": "A Soccer aka Futball aka Football Site - News, Blogs, Opinion, and More", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/soccer/playingfor90/logo_playingfor90-com__300x300.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/soccer/playingfor90/logo_playingfor90-com__150x150.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/soccer/playingfor90/logo_playingfor90-com__300x300.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/soccer/playingfor90/logo_playingfor90-com.png", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1253151007"}, "canonical_link": "https://playingfor90.com/2019/12/31/tottenham-used-barcelona-philippe-coutinho/"}
