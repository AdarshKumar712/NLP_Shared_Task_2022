Prejudiced and unsubstantiated allegations repeatedly published by media serve only to fuel intolerance.\n\nWe shared our views during a meeting today with the Prime Minister. On that occasion we welcomed the government's commitment to address hate speech and to set up a religious reconciliation council.\n\nWe stand by all Sri Lankans working to preserve the peaceful coexistence between all communities, and expect religious and other community leaders to support them and speak out against violence.\n\nWe urge the President, Prime Minister, and all political leaders to reassert the state\u2019s commitment to mutual respect, tolerance, and equal treatment under the law for all, irrespective of faith or ethnicity.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["European Commission", "European Union", "EU"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Delegation of the European Union (EU) issues the following statement in agreement with the embassies of France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Romania and the UK High Commission, as well as the Embassies of Norway and Switzerland.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/themes/eeas/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "The Delegation of the European Union (EU) issues the following statement in agreement with the embassies of France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Romania and the UK High Commission, as well as the Embassies of Norway and Switzerland.", "og": {"image": "https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/press-default-pic_0.png", "site_name": "EEAS - European External Action Service - European Commission", "type": "website", "url": "https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/sri-lanka/63994/joint-statement_en", "title": "Joint Statement", "description": "EEAS - European External Action Service - European Union External Action"}, "keywords": "European Commission, European Union, EU", "robots": "follow, index", "generator": "Drupal 7 (https://drupal.org)", "revisit-after": "15 days", "twitter": {"image": "https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/press-default-pic_0.png"}, "dcterms.title": "Joint Statement", "dcterms.type": "Text", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.identifier": "https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/sri-lanka/63994/joint-statement_en", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "creator": "COMM/DG/UNIT", "reference": "EEAS - European External Action Service", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge", "date": "29/06/2019 - 01:29", "classification": 26000}, "canonical_link": "https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/sri-lanka_en/63994/Joint Statement"}
