The film received overwhelming reviews from the critics and was a box office success, grossed over USD 1 billion worldwide.\n\nEver since, the director has been facing questions regarding a potential sequel to the film.\n\nPhillips said at Deadline's The Contenders New York award-season event he is \"open\" to reunite with Phoenix but nothing is final as of yet.\n\n\"When a movie does USD 1 billion and costs USD 60 million to make, of course, it comes up. But Joaquin and I haven't really decided on it. We're open.\n\n\"I mean, I'd love to work with him on anything, quite frankly,\" the filmmaker said.\n\nEven if the project is a sequel to \"Joker\", Phillips said he will only direct if he believes the new film will be able to resonate with the audiences like the original.\n\n\"So who knows? But it would have to have a real thematic resonance the way this one did, ultimately being about childhood trauma and the lack of love, and the loss of empathy,\" the director said.\n\n\"All those things are really what made this movie work for us, so we'd have to have something that had an equal thematic resonance,\" he added.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Films", "Creative works", "Fiction", "English-language films", "Joker", "The Dark Knight Trilogy", "The Joker in other media", "DC Comics", "Joker in other media", "Draft:DC Black", "director", "New York", "Joaquin Phoenix", "Todd Phillips"], "tags": ["Entertainment Culture"], "authors": ["Press Trust Of India"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Read more about We're open: Todd Phillips on 'Joker' sequel on Business Standard.
