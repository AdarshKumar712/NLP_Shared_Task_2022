SUPPLEMENTAL POWER SYSTEM to produce clean and free electricity. This invention would easily install as a replacement to existing downspouts. Additionally, it would protect the environment as it would eliminate tapping into the grid for power.\n\nThe original design was submitted to the Bowling Green sales office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
