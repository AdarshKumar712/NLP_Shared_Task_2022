The Zack Baun\u2013led Badgers, though, are No. 8 in FBS in total defense, allowing about 37 fewer yards a game that the 23rd-ranked Ducks defense.\n\nThe Ducks will need their 11th-ranked rush defense to put in a masterful performance. Wisconsin\u2019s All-American running back Jonathan Taylor has rushed for 1,909 yards for the season and could become the first player in over two decades\u2014since Iowa State\u2019s Troy Davis in 1995 and 1996\u2014to reach 2,000 yards in consecutive seasons.\n\n\u201cYou just got to pursue to the ball and you got to gang tackle,\u201d said Oregon defensive back Thomas Graham Jr., ESPN reported. \u201cHe\u2019s a running back that is special in so many ways. I think he\u2019s like top five in the nation in broken tackles [and] his offensive line blocks [with] very good form.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how to watch Wisconsin vs. Oregon in the Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual.\n\nRose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual\n\nLocation: Rose Bowl, Pasadena, California\n\nDate: Jan. 1, 5pm ET\n\nStreaming: ESPN\n\nHow to stream Oregon vs. Wisconsin live: Watch the Rose Bowl\n\nThe following services offer a one-week trial.\n\nHow to use AirTV with Sling\n\nAirTV solves one of Sling\u2019s biggest problems: The inability to receive all of your local channels. By purchasing a basic AirTV for $79.99 or the AirTV Player for $119.99, you can merge those local channels into your Sling TV, (or on your mobile device if you have the basic AirTV). As the Daily Dot wrote in its AirTV review, \u201cIt\u2019s practically magic.\u201d\n\nThe basic AirTV is a dual-tuner streaming device, while the AirTV Player is basically an upgraded Chromecast that has Netflix preinstalled. You\u2019ll still need to own an HD antenna because even though AirTV gets you access to your local channels, it doesn\u2019t actually physically show them to you.\n\nBut AirTV\u2014which has no monthly fee\u2014serves to strengthen one of Sling\u2019s biggest weaknesses compared to other live streaming services like Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, and PlayStation Vue. All those services have plenty of local channels. While select NFL and college football games (on Fox, FS1, and FS2) are no longer on Sling, you can still catch Fox games with AirTV.\n\nTRY AIRTV\n\nCost: $54.99 per month\n\n$54.99 per month Hulu devices : Roku, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire Stick and Fire TV, Xbox One, Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, and iOS and Android devices\n\nRoku, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire Stick and Fire TV, Xbox One, Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, and iOS and Android devices Hulu local channels: ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, the CW (check your local availability here)\n\nHulu with Live TV includes sports programming among its offerings, including ESPN and FS1, and as a subscriber to the service, you\u2019ll get free access to Hulu\u2019s sizable on-demand library. (Check out the full list of Hulu Live TV channels.)\n\nTRY HULU WITH LIVE TV\n\nYouTube TV is a great option for college football: Fox, ABC, NBC, CBS, FS1, FS2, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN News, and ESPNU are all here and offer a nearly 360 programming platter of action. (Take a look at the full list of YouTube TV channels here.)\n\nTRY YOUTUBE TV\n\nRose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual: Notes\n\nWisconsin edge Zack Baun has significantly improved his draft stock and will attempt to make the most of the bowl game by being a force against Oregon\u2019s talented offensive line. He\u2019s had issues staying on the field for the Badgers, so any tape\u2014especially against decent-to-good offensive lines\u2014is crucial for his draft positioning.\n\nBaun having a great day does not equal a Wisconsin win because he\u2019s not necessarily unblockable, requiring consistent double teams, but it will help considerably.\n\nWisconsin EDGE and Senior Bowler Zack Baun is probably the player who has exceeded my expectations most on final film review. Bend isn't great, but when you can soften rush angles and force OTs into recovery position as quickly as Baun does, you don't need elite bend! \ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udd0a pic.twitter.com/3CLooda2NW \u2014 Benjamin Solak (@BenjaminSolak) December 28, 2019\n\nNew to cord-cutting?
