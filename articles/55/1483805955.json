Jesse O'Donaghey told CTV News.\n\nUnfortunately, the camp's remote location near the north point of the island means there are few security cameras around that could shed light on who is responsible.\n\nInvestigators said they're hoping someone with information on what happened will come forward. In the meantime, the RCMP is consulting with its hate crime team.\n\n\"We completely understand the feelings that that the community may have \u2026 discovering something like this, and we just want to reassure them that we're taking this seriously,\" O'Donaghey said.\n\nCamp Miriam hosts elementary school and high school children over the summers, and teaches them about \"Israel, Jewish history, social justice and the environment,\" according to its website.\n\nJames Dayson of the Miriam Foundation described the camp as \"such a special place\" to the young campers who go there.\n\nWhile the vandalism was disturbing, Dayson said he's thankful there were no kids at camp when it was discovered.\n\nHe also said the response from the small island community \u2013 including hundreds of messages of support on social media \u2013 has been a silver lining on an otherwise unfortunate situation.\n\n\"The response we've had has been absolutely beautiful,\" he said. \"The don't want something like this to reflect on their community. It's obviously an isolated incident \u2013 we've never had issues with safety.\"\n\nDayson said some Gabriola residents have also organized a candlelit vigil for the afternoon of Jan. 2 outside the Camp Miriam property.\n\nHe's hopeful they can take the experience and use it to spread awareness.\n\n\"This is an opportunity to have more education,\" Dayson said. \"We have a meeting coming up in January where one of the things we want to discuss is how do we take this negative situation and make it into something positive.\"\n\nPolice said anyone with information on the graffiti can contact the Gabriola RCMP detachment at 250-247-8333. Tipsters who want to remain anonymous can instead call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.\n\nWith files from CTV News Vancouver's Spencer Harwood", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Surrey", "Burnaby", "Metro Vancouver", "Fraser Valley", "North Shore", "Coquitlam", "Richmond", "Tri-Cities", "Delta", "Langley", "news", "Vancouver news", "CTV News", "CTV BC", "CTVBC", "BCTV news", "news Vancouver", "CTV Morning Live"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Andrew Weichel"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 17:12:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Police are investigating after a Jewish summer camp on Gabriola Island was vandalized with hateful graffiti, including swastikas.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//static.ctvnews.ca/bellmedia/ctvnews/img/fav-icons-2019/57x57-CTVNews-Icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Police are investigating after a Jewish summer camp on Gabriola Island was vandalized with hateful graffiti, including swastikas.", "keywords": "Surrey, Burnaby, Metro Vancouver, Fraser Valley, North Shore, Coquitlam, Richmond, Tri-Cities, Delta, Langley, news, Vancouver news, CTV News, CTV BC, CTVBC, BCTV news, news Vancouver, CTV Morning Live", "news_keywords": "hate crime, swastika, jewish summer camp, camp miriam, gabriola island", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "fb": {"pages": 174761742563060, "admins": "ctvbcnews"}, "dc.date.modified": "2019-12-31", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jewish summer camp vandalized with racist graffiti on Gabriola Island", "description": "Police are investigating after a Jewish summer camp on Gabriola Island was vandalized with hateful graffiti, including swastikas.", "url": "https://bc.ctvnews.ca/jewish-summer-camp-vandalized-with-racist-graffiti-on-gabriola-island-1.4749389", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4749392.1577841082!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg", "site_name": "British Columbia", "locale": "en_CA"}, "twitter": {"title": "Jewish summer camp vandalized with racist graffiti on Gabriola Island", "url": "https://bc.ctvnews.ca/jewish-summer-camp-vandalized-with-racist-graffiti-on-gabriola-island-1.4749389", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Police are investigating after a Jewish summer camp on Gabriola Island was vandalized with hateful graffiti, including swastikas.", "site": "@CTVVancouver", "creator": "@CTVVancouver", "image": {"src": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4749392.1577841082!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg"}}, "author": "Andrew Weichel", "article": {"author": "Andrew Weichel", "published_time": "2019-12-31T17:12:00-08:00"}}, "canonical_link": "https://bc.ctvnews.ca/jewish-summer-camp-vandalized-with-racist-graffiti-on-gabriola-island-1.4749389"}
