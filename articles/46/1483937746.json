It\u2019s driving President Trump and his allies a bit batty trying to figure out what she\u2019s up to by holding back the articles of impeachment.\n\nDemocratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer offered a benign explanation after the Dec. 19 House vote for the delay. He cited \u201chousekeeping matters,\u201d explaining that once the articles are sent to the Senate, the upper house has to act. It can\u2019t do any other business until it deals with impeachment.\n\nDemocrats would like the Senate to pass the USMCA trade agreement, and maybe even vote on a House-passed prescription cost containment bill before a Senate trial gets underway. Holding onto the articles is the only leverage Pelosi has on McConnell, who says he won\u2019t take up USMCA until after any impeachment trial.\n\n\u201cThis is working beautifully for her, and for the country,\u201d says Norm Ornstein, a political scientist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIn the weeks since the House voted for Impeachment, there have been more damning emails, and there\u2019s no reason to believe we have seen the end of it.\u201d\n\nDelaying the trial allows more evidence of wrongdoing by the president and his allies to surface and potentially sway public opinion and perhaps even some Senate Republicans.\n\nAfter the House voted the articles, the conventional wisdom was that Democrats needed the Senate to act quickly so a trial would conclude before the 2020 primaries got underway. That thinking has now shifted. \u201cA trial at some point is almost inevitable,\u201d says Ornstein. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see any reason to push it forward as long as Democrats have the upper hand.\u201d\n\nPushed for a time limit, Ornstein told The Daily Beast that he thinks Pelosi can extend through February, \u201ckeeping all options open,\u201d he said. \u201cIn moments of this kind, my lodestar is whatever Pelosi does is best.\u201d\n\nTom Mann with the Brookings Institution and co-author with Ornstein of the 2012 book about Congress, It\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks, said in an email that he\u2019s \u201csure Pelosi is adjusting her cost/benefit analysis and consulting widely every day. McConnell\u2019s outrageous behavior gives her cover to stretch this out to force genuine consultations on rules and witnesses for the trial. If and when she finds the political costs are likely to outweigh the benefits, she will refer the articles to the Senate. But not until then.\u201d\n\nMcConnell calls himself \u201cthe Grim Reaper,\u201d gleefully letting House-passed legislation on health care, voting rights and gun safety languish indefinitely. Yet he stands ready to act expeditiously on impeachment, working in \u201ctotal coordination\u201d with the White House to mount a sham trial to exonerate the president.\n\nTime is on Pelosi\u2019s side, for now. The latest revelations about key officials around Trump who were in the loop on Ukraine indicate that many of them knew what they were doing was wrong. \u201cFacing disapproval, humiliation, and possible jail time, it\u2019s almost inevitable some will talk,\u201d says Ornstein.\n\n\u201c The calculation now is that Trump wants the Senate trial to be over with as quickly as possible so he can spend 2020 touting his exoneration. \u201d\n\nThere is far more pressure now on Trump to get the exoneration he seeks from the Senate than on the Democrats to move the process along before the Iowa caucuses. Pelosi has leverage to seek concessions about rules and witnesses. \u201cMcConnell is impervious to pressure unless there\u2019s something McConnell wants,\u201d says John Lawrence, Pelosi\u2019s former chief of staff. He cites the recent year-end $1.4 trillion federal spending bill that explodes the deficit and includes more than $1 billion in special grants for Kentucky. \u201cMcConnell got billions for Kentucky, he always does,\u201d says Lawrence. \u201cWhen he wants something, he makes deals.\u201d\n\nThe calculation now is that Trump wants the Senate trial to be over with as quickly as possible so he can spend 2020 touting his exoneration. Dragging it out increases the risk of more potentially damaging information emerging, which in turn could prompt more people to come forward with what they know.\n\nThe likelihood of a Senate conviction to remove Trump from office remains extremely low. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t whether or not a Senate trial will be held. It will, and we all know how it will turn out,\u201d says Jonah Blank, a former Senate staffer on the Democratic side. \u201cThe question is much narrower: Will a delayed time frame force swing-state Republicans into votes that will hurt them in 2020 or a future election?\u201d There are at least two such GOP senators, and arguably as many as five or six.\n\nPelosi is in no rush. She can wait until McConnell sends her a set of rules, and then there will be some back-and-forth as both sides claim victory. She followed the historic procedure of inviting Trump to deliver the State of the Union on Feb. 4, when he could still be in the midst of impeachment. He won\u2019t be the first president to give a SOTU while being impeached. In 1999, President Clinton focused on a sound economy and a $70 billion budget surplus. He did not mention impeachment.\n\nWith Pelosi seated directly behind him in the House chamber, millions of Americans will tune in to watch the dynamics between these two political figures on what promises to be yet another historic evening for the country\u2014and one that could set a tone for the rest of this incredibly important year.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Donald J.
