A member of Mr Buhari's party, APC, also approached the court to nullify the term limit set in the constitution. The party man later withdrew the suit after the APC distanced itself from it.\n\nMr Buhari was first elected president in 2015 on the APC platform. He won reelection earlier this year defeating dozens of other candidates including Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\nIn his letter titled, 'A Letter from the President at New Year', President Buhari stated that his primary concern is the security of the nation and the safety of its citizens.\n\n\"When I assumed office in May 2015, my first task was to rally our neighbours so that we could confront Boko Haram on a coordinated regional basis. Chaos is not a neighbour any of us hope for.\n\n\"We have been fighting on several fronts: violent extremists, cultists and organised criminal networks. It has not been easy. But as we are winning the war, we also look to the challenge of winning the peace, the reconstruction of lives, communities and markets. The North East Development Commission will work with local and international stakeholders to help create a new beginning for the North East,\" he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Africa", "news", "politics", "economy", "trade", "business", "sports", "current events", "travel", "Nigeria", "West Africa", "Governance"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Oge Udegbunam"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 15:50:18 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "President Muhammadu Buhari has assured Nigerians that he will leave office in 2023.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn03.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "President Muhammadu Buhari has assured Nigerians that he will leave office in 2023.", "google-site-verification": "bGxG4qeN9up-gMXKjsgylykqjVrzxLjg1rQrP3K-rJk", "keywords": "Africa, news, politics, economy, trade, business, sports, current events, travel, Nigeria, West Africa, Governance", "msvalidate.01": "72401C28AAAC95E8D3FF1881A90F2C4D", "robots": "noarchive", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "President Muhammadu Buhari has assured Nigerians that he will leave office in 2023.", "image": {"src": "https://allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00541016:4d1afcd82e27ff801b61e9f960c28e74:arc614x376:w1200.jpg"}, "site": "@allafrica", "title": "Nigeria: Buhari Pledges to Leave Office in 2023"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "article": {"modified_time": "2020-01-01T16:03:16+0000", "published_time": "2020-01-01T15:50:18+0000", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/allAfricacom/98946450029", "section": "News", "tag": "Governance"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100369188719, "pages": 98946450029}, "og": {"description": "President Muhammadu Buhari has assured Nigerians that he will leave office in 2023.", "image": "https://allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00541016:4d1afcd82e27ff801b61e9f960c28e74:arc614x376:w1200.jpg", "site_name": "allAfrica.com", "title": "Nigeria: Buhari Pledges to Leave Office in 2023", "type": "article", "url": "https://allafrica.com/stories/202001010162.html"}}, "canonical_link": "https://allafrica.com/stories/202001010162.html"}
