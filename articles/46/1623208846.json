There was also heavy congestion near beauty spots in cantons Glarus, Zug and Appenzell Inner-Rhodes. The Glarus police had to block several roads when some sites became overcrowded.\n\n\n\nThe popular Verzasca Valley in canton Ticino in southern Switzerland also saw a big influx of visitors.\n\n\n\nFancy a dip?\n\nIn Geneva, 30 beaches and lakeside swimming spots opened to the public for the first time, with visitors recommended to continue to respect social distancing measures. In Lausanne, authorities introduced a summer-long ban on cars along a popular lakeside road.\n\n\n\nPostBus reported busy services, especially on routes leading to the start of mountain hikes, according to spokeswoman Val\u00e9rie Gerl. In trains, the occupancy rates varied from line to line, reaching a maximum of 80% on some sections.\n\nWhile there were few reports of problems from police, in Zurich officers had to intervene a dozen times to prevent large gatherings of cyclists and people meeting at public lakeside areas that are still closed.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the air assistance organisation REGA reported carrying out a total of 130 rescue missions over the weekend, including winching stranded hikers or injured bikers from the mountains.\n\n\n\nMany of the unprecedented lockdown measures have been relaxed in Switzerland owing to a positive evolution of the pandemic, including the easing of some border restrictions. For now, however, most Swiss people are unable to leave the country. The government plans to lift travel restrictions with France, Germany and Austria on June 15. But it has told southern neighbour Italy that lifting border controls from June 3, a decision announced by Italy, was \u201ctoo early\u201d.\n\nThis article was automatically imported from our old content management system.
