At the moment I know Tailevu players are working on their own training programs and can\u2019t wait for the competition to restart.\u201d\n\nWith the restrictions in place, Turaganivalu said a lot had been done in the past weeks.\n\n\u201cI have spent more time with my family doing our backyard gardening and most of all more time with my grandchildren.\n\n\u201cI am asking all adults and young adults to set an example for our children and spend more time with them.\n\n\u201cTime is precious, don\u2019t waste it, you won\u2019t die if you stay home.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Paulini Curuqara"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fijitimes", "image": "https://www.fijitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tailevu-Rugby-2.jpg"}, "og": {"image": "https://www.fijitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tailevu-Rugby-2.jpg", "title": "Tailevu Rugby Union prepares training plans", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.fijitimes.com/tailevu-rugby-union-prepares-training-plans/", "site_name": "FijiTimes"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.0.3"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.fijitimes.com/tailevu-rugby-union-prepares-training-plans/"}
