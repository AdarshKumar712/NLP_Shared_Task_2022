Neal.\n\nThe deal, which all three teams agreed to on Tuesday night, fell apart over Boston\u2019s medical concerns regarding Twins pitcher Brusdar Graterol. The 21-year-old hurler would go to the Red Sox, along with Dodgers outfielder Alex Verdugo. In exchange, Minnesota would receive pitcher Kenta Maeda from the Dodgers.\n\nGraterol underwent Tommy John surgery in 2016 and missed significant time in 2019 with a right shoulder impingement. However, Graterol\u2019s agent Scott Boras revealed that multiple orthopedic doctors confirmed there are no long-term issues with his arm.\n\nBoston\u2019s front office started seeking another top-10 prospect from the Twins to complete the deal. While the Twins were comfortable dealing Graterol to land Maeda, the front office ultimately determined adding another prospect was unreasonable and is now pulling out of the deal.\n\nThe teams faced pressure from the MLB Players\u2019 Association to find a resolution to the deal after dragging players through days of uncertainty regarding their futures.\n\nSpring training is just days away, which will likely add further pressure to the Dodgers and Red Sox to make the deal work. Whether it\u2019s finding a new third team or making things work themselves, both sides are reportedly trying to find a solution.\n\nFor now, however, Betts and Price remain members of the Red Sox.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Feb  8 16:09:21 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "For now, Mookie Betts and David Price remain members of the Red Sox.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png?v=2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "For now, Mookie Betts and David Price remain members of the Red Sox.", "fb": {"app_id": 125075807517358}, "og": {"title": "Twins reportedly pulling out of blockbuster Mookie Betts deal", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.yardbarker.com/mlb/articles/twins_reportedly_pulling_out_of_blockbuster_mookie_betts_deal/s1_12680_31261676", "image": "https://www.yardbarker.com/media/4/9/496c99c0a92d5cac9b7bdccb2d59104bb38f7d80/thumb_16x9/13378088.jpg?v=1", "description": "For now, Mookie Betts and David Price remain members of the Red Sox.", "site_name": "Yardbarker"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-08T16:09:21-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-08T16:09:21-05:00", "section": "Sports", "tag": "Alex Verdugo,Brusdar Graterol,David Price,Kenta Maeda,Mookie Betts,Boston Red Sox,Los Angeles Dodgers,Minnesota Twins,MLB"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@yardbarker", "title": "Twins reportedly pulling out of blockbuster Mookie Betts deal", "description": "For now, Mookie Betts and David Price remain members of the Red Sox.", "image": "https://www.yardbarker.com/media/4/9/496c99c0a92d5cac9b7bdccb2d59104bb38f7d80/thumb_16x9/13378088.jpg?v=1"}}, "canonical_link": "https://sportsnaut.com/2020/02/report-twins-pulling-out-of-three-team-blockbuster-deal/"}
