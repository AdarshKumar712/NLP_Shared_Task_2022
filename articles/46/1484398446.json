Hey, look, it\u2019s good. Golf is fine. But always play with leaders of countries and people that can help us! Don\u2019t play with your friends all the time.\u201d\n\nThat summer, he said at another campaign stop: \u201cIf I win I may never see my property \u2014 I may never see these places again. But because I\u2019m going to be working for you, I\u2019m not going to have time to go golfing, believe me. Believe me. Believe me, folks.\u201d\n\nNow, CNN has tallied that Mr Trump likely spent one out of five days playing golf, a total it reached using a variety of methods as the White House routinely refuses to confirm if he has played a game.\n\nMany of those games were at one of his own golf courses, in Florida, New Jersey, Virginia or Ireland. He also suggested hosting the G7 summit at one of his courses, but reversed the idea after criticism.\n\nThe calculation appeared to tally with a calculation compiled by the Washington Post that suggested since becoming president, he had spent a third of his days visiting a Trump-branded property.\n\nAsked about his holiday plans by a member of the military whom he addressed over the Christmas holidays from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, the president replied: \u201cI\u2019m at a place called Mar-a-Lago, we call it the southern White House. I really pretty much work. That\u2019s what I like to do.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, one of the Democrats seeking to challenge Mr Trump in 2020, took aim at his prolific golfing.\n\n\u201cFor the record, I spent 0 days on the golf course in 2019,\u201d tweeted Amy Klobuchar.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump administration \u2018to ban most e-cigarette flavours\u2019\n\nGiuliani threatens to \u2018do demonstrations\u2019 at Trump impeachment trial\n\nIran\u2019s supreme leader attacks Trump on Twitter\n\nTrump insists Kim Jong-un is \u2018man of his word\u2019", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["golf", "Barack Obama", "he would be too busy", "Donald Trump"], "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 23:22:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Donald Trump has been criticised after it was reported he spent nearly one out of every five days playing golf last year \u2013 despite famously telling voters he would be too busy working for such activity.Even before he launched his bid for the White House, Mr Trump frequently criticised Barack Obama for", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@yahooNewsUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Donald Trump has been criticised after it was reported he spent nearly one out of every five days playing golf last year \u2013 despite famously telling voters he would be too busy working for such activity.Even before he launched his bid for the White House, Mr Trump frequently criticised Barack Obama for", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YvzcikIpFMCcExUvFABzxA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/8ea370903f32c792ea0c96905bc30054", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YvzcikIpFMCcExUvFABzxA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/8ea370903f32c792ea0c96905bc30054"}, "title": "Trump attacked for spending '1 in every 5 days' at a golf club in 2019"}, "summary": "Latest News, World & UK News Headlines", "robots": "noindex", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, golf courses, White House, playing the game", "googlebot": "noindex", "bingbot": "noindex", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=3ffc738c-afe3-3a6d-b359-8c70388e23e5&src=web", "description": "Donald Trump has been criticised after it was reported he spent nearly one out of every five days playing golf last year \u2013 despite famously telling voters he would be too busy working for such activity.Even before he launched his bid for the White House, Mr Trump frequently criticised Barack Obama for", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YvzcikIpFMCcExUvFABzxA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/8ea370903f32c792ea0c96905bc30054", "description": "Donald Trump has been criticised after it was reported he spent nearly one out of every five days playing golf last year \u2013 despite famously telling voters he would be too busy working for such activity.Even before he launched his bid for the White House, Mr Trump frequently criticised Barack Obama for", "title": "Trump attacked for spending '1 in every 5 days' at a golf club in 2019", "url": "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-attacked-spending-1-every-232221258.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 115060728528067}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=3ffc738c-afe3-3a6d-b359-8c70388e23e5&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=3ffc738c-afe3-3a6d-b359-8c70388e23e5&src=web"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-attacked-spending-1-every-232221258.html"}
