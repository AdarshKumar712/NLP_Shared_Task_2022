It's a retrograde move risking a disastrous war.\n\nIn a visit to China this week, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Chinese leader Xi Jinping both urged for greater momentum in the diplomatic process with North Korea, saying that renewed tensions benefit no-one. The two leaders may need to revise that assertion. Tensions greatly benefit someone Washington.\n\nWhy Trump is winding up tensions again with Pyongyang appears to involve a two-fold calculation. It gives Washington greater leverage to extort more money from South Korea for the presence of US military forces on its territory; secondly, the Trump administration can use the tensions as cover for increasing its regional forces aimed at confronting China.\n\nIn recent weeks, the rhetoric has deteriorated sharply between Washington and Pyongyang. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has resumed references to Trump being a senile \"dotard,\" while the US president earlier this month at the NATO summit near London dusted off his old disparaging name for Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, calling him \"rocket man.\"\n\nOn December 7 and 15, North Korea tested rocket engines at its Sohae satellite launching site which are believed to be preparation for the imminent test-firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). North Korea unilaterally halted ICBM test-launches in April 2018 as a gesture for diplomacy with the US. Its last launch was on July 4, 2017, when Pyongyang mockingly called it a \"gift\" for America's Independence Day.\n\nEarlier this month, Pyongyang said it was preparing a \"Christmas gift\" for Washington. That was taken as referring to resumption of ICBM test launches. However, Pyongyang said it was up to the US to decide which gift it would deliver.\n\nOn the engine testing, Trump said he was \"watching closely\" on what North Korea did next, warning that he was prepared to use military force against Pyongyang and that Kim Jong-un had \"everything to lose.\"\n\nThe turning away from diplomacy may seem odd. Trump first met Kim in June 2018 in Singapore at a breakthrough summit, the first time a sitting US president met with a North Korean leader. There were two more summits, in Hanoi in February 2019, and at the Demilitarized Zone on the Korean border in June 2019. The latter occasion was a splendid photo-opportunity for Trump, being the first American president to have stepped on North Korean soil.\n\nDuring this diplomatic embrace, Trump has lavished Kim with praise and thanked him for \"beautiful letters.\" Back in September 2017 when hostile rhetoric was flying both ways, Trump told the UN general assembly he would \"totally destroy\" North Korea if it threatened the US. How fickle are the ways of Trump.\n\nWhat's happened is the initial promises of engagement have gone nowhere, indicating the superficiality of Trump's diplomacy. It seems clear now that the US president was only interested in public relations gimmickry, boasting to the American public that he had reined in North Korea's nuclear activities.\n\nWhen Trump met Kim for the third time in June 2019, they reportedly vowed to resume negotiations on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. North Korea had up until recently stuck to its commitment to halt ICBM testing. However, for that, Pyongyang expected reciprocation from the US side on the issue of sanctions relief, at least a partial lifting of sanctions. Kim gave Trump a deadline by the end of this year to make some concession on sanctions.\n\nRussia and China last week proposed an easing of UN sanctions on North Korea. But Washington rebuffed that proposal, categorically saying it was a \"premature\" move, and that North Korea must first make irreversible steps towards complete decommissioning of its nuclear arsenal. The high-handed attitude is hardly conducive to progress.\n\nThe lack of diplomatic reciprocation from Washington over the past six months has led Pyongyang to angrily repudiate further talks. It has hit out at what it calls Trump's renewed demeaning name-calling of Kim. There is also a palpable sense of frustration on North Korea's part for having been used as a prop for Trump's electioneering.\n\nThe fact that Washington has adopted an intransigent position with regard to sanctions would indicate that it never was serious about pursuing meaningful diplomacy with Pyongyang.\n\nNext Page 1 | 2", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["China", "Conflict", "Korea", "North Korea And South Korea", "North Koreans", "Sanctions", "Trump And Kim Round Two Summit", "Trump Praises Kim Jung-un"], "tags": ["Sanctions", "North Korea And South Korea", "North Koreans", "Trump Praises Kim Jung-un", "Trump And Kim Round Two Summit", "China", "Conflict", "Korea"], "authors": ["Finian Cunningham"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Article: Why Trump is Winding Up Tensions with North Korea - The logic of war profits and strategic conflict with China mean that Trump and the Washington establishment do not want to find a peaceful resolution with North Korea.
