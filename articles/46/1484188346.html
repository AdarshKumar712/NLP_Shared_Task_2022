<p>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Rt. Hon Julian Smith MP, today announced that he has appointed Councillors Allan Bresland, Catherine Elattar and Michael Ruane and Alderman Amanda Grehan to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) Board. In the absence of Northern Ireland Ministers, these appointments were made possible by the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation and Exercise of Functions) Act 2018.</p>

<p>These appointments will take effect from today (1 January 2020) until the date of the next Council elections and will ensure that the NIHE Board can continue to deliver vital public services within its remit for the benefit of the Northern Ireland community.</p>

<h2 id="notes-for-editors">NOTES FOR EDITORS</h2>

<h3 id="the-northern-ireland-housing-executive-nihe">The Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE)</h3>
<p>The NIHE is a Non-Departmental Public Body of the NI Department for Communities and was established by the Housing Executive Act (Northern Ireland) 1971.  Under this Act, the NIHE took over the housing responsibilities of 65 separate authorities and became Northern Irelandâ€™s overall housing authority. It is currently landlord to approximately 86,500 dwellings and is one of Northern Irelandâ€™s largest public sector organisations with a budget of over Â£740m and a staff of approximately 2,700. It also makes a substantial contribution to better health, education and wellbeing through housing.</p>

<p>Provision for the NIHE Board is set out in the Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1981. The principal role of the Board is to set the strategic direction for the Housing Executive and to provide stewardship of all public resources entrusted to it to implement the policies and priorities of the Minister and the Executive. The Board oversees the performance and outputs of the executive team, which is responsible for the day-to-day conduct of the business within the Housing Executive. The Board also sets the attitude and disposition of the organisation towards compliance with applicable laws and best practice.</p>

<p>Provision for the NIHE Board is set out in the Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1981. In October 2018, the Secretary of State for NI introduced legislation in Parliament; the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation and Exercise of Functions) Act 2018 received Royal Assent on 1 November. This legislation provides for the appointment to a number of public offices by the Secretary of State.  The NI (Ministerial Appointment Functions) Regulations 2019 came into force on 18 February 2019.  This Instrument provided for further critical appointments, including that of the NIHE Board.</p>
