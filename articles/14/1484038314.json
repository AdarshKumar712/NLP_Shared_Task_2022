According to the Los Angeles Fire Department, four people staying at the hotel admitted they had ingested the opioid fentanyl.\n\n\u201cOne person was in grave condition, three others showing signs of narcotic overdose,\u201d Battalion Chief Andrew Wordin, of the LAFD, said.\n\nThat admission triggered a hazmat response. Fire crews said they believed the threat was contained to the one room, but they brought in special equipment for tests just to make sure the hotel was safe for guests.\n\n\u201cFentanyl is a very, very potent opiate, and it can cause, in very low doses, euphoria,\u201d Dr. David Levine, of the Keck School of Medicine, said. \u201cBut in more high doses or moderate doses, it can cause someone to become comatose and stop breathing and ultimately lead to cardiac arrest.\u201d\n\nLevine is the chief of the toxicology division at USC\u2019s Keck School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cFentanyl has become relatively cheap, and people are using that to get high,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people are also using fentanyl as a cutting agent to cut other drugs, meaning they will dilute the quantity of the other drug by substituting fentanyl.\u201d\n\nBack in October, Orange County authorities had their biggest fentanyl bust ever, 20 pounds of the synthetic opioid, which they said was enough to kill the county\u2019s 3.2 million residents three times over. Fentanyl is so deadly that just a tine amount can kill \u2014 even if it\u2019s not ingested.\n\nMany first responders, including firefighters and police officers, carry a medication to reverse the effects of an overdose.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["fentanyl", "fentanyl overdose", "woodland hills"], "tags": ["Fentanyl Overdose", "Fentanyl", "Woodland Hills"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The manager of an extended-stay hotel said the hotel had been deemed safe and that operations had returned back to normal Tuesday night after a massive morning response to what authorities called an example of the ongoing opioid epidemic.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/06/cropped-la-favicon-512.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "%tags%", "keywords": "fentanyl, fentanyl overdose, woodland hills", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "fb": {"pages": 57972945858}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"title": "4 People Hospitalized After Reported Fentanyl Exposure, 1 In Grave Condition", "image": {"identifier": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/Fentanyl-Exposure.jpg?w=1280", "secure_url": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/Fentanyl-Exposure.jpg?w=1280", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The manager of an extended-stay hotel said the hotel had been deemed safe and that operations had returned back to normal Tuesday night after a massive morning response to what authorities called an example of the ongoing opioid epidemic.", "type": "article", "url": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/12/31/four-people-one-in-grave-condition-reported-to-be-suffering-from-fentanyl-exposure/"}, "article": {"published_time": "2019-12-31T18:30:37+00:00", "suggested-social-copy": "The manager of an extended-stay hotel said the hotel had been deemed safe and that operations had returned back to normal Tuesday night after a massive morning response to what authorities called an example of the ongoing opioid epidemic.", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/12/Fentanyl-Exposure.jpg?w=1280", "title": "4 People Hospitalized After Reported Fentanyl Exposure, 1 In Grave Condition", "description": "The manager of an extended-stay hotel said the hotel had been deemed safe and that operations had returned back to normal Tuesday night after a massive morning response to what authorities called an example of the ongoing opioid epidemic.", "site": "CBSLA"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14984641/2019/06/cropped-la-favicon-512.png?w=270", "description": "The manager of an extended-stay hotel said the hotel had been deemed safe and that operations had returned back to normal Tuesday night after a massive morning response to what authorities called an example of the ongoing opioid epidemic."}, "canonical_link": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/12/31/four-people-one-in-grave-condition-reported-to-be-suffering-from-fentanyl-exposure/"}
