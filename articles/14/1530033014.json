As of Friday, Japan's Ministry of Health reported that 705 people from the ship had contracted the virus, as well as one quarantine officer who worked on the ship. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced Friday that 44 passengers flown back to the US had tested positive.\n\nSix people who were on the ship have died.\n\n\"The quarantine was not justified, and violated the individual rights of the passengers while allowing the virus to literally pick them off one-by-one,\" Dr. Amesh Adalja, who works at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nAdalja and other experts have criticized the decision to keep passengers and crew on the ship and said poor hygiene practices helped spread the virus.\n\n\"I'd like to sugarcoat it and try to be diplomatic about it, but it failed,\" Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told USA Today. \"People were getting infected on that ship.
