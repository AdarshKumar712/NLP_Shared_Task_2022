Sherrod Brown (D-OH) has never voted in favor of a trade deal \u2014 until now.\n\nOne of Brown\u2019s first votes as a member of Congress was against the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993. In the decades since, he has railed against the deal arguing that it cost American jobs.\n\n\u201cI voted against every trade agreement since I've been member of the House or Senate, because every trade agreement has been written by corporate interests to enrich executives and stock holders and not for workers,\u201d said Brown.\n\nNow, Brown plans to vote \u201cyes\u201d on the new NAFTA, known as the United States Mexico Canada Agreement or USMCA when the full Senate considers it. He already voted to approve the implementation bill in the Senate Finance Committee last week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday he expects the full Senate to vote on USMCA by the end of the week.\n\n\u201cI never thought this day would come,\u201d Brown said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt happened because...people overwhelmingly understood that the NAFTA was bad for our communities, especially in the industrial Midwest.\u201d\n\nBrown and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) worked together to push for stronger labor provisions in the deal.\n\n\u201cFinally, we saw a chance to renegotiate it and we knew if we stuck together, and together meant all the Democrats put pressure on the president saying, \u2018Quit betraying workers. This matters for workers,\u2019 and we succeeded,\u201d said Brown.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers in the House negotiated with United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer for months on the deal\u2019s labor, environmental, pharmaceutical and enforcement provisions. Last month, Speaker Pelosi announced a compromise and the House passed the USMCA implementation bill in a landslide vote.\n\n\u201cWe went to work and we convinced the president \u2014 kicking and screaming \u2014 that we needed strong labor enforcement and that this agreement should be centered around workers, not around corporate interests,\u201d said Brown.\n\nBrown pointed to provisions that protect Mexican workers\u2019 rights to form union and measures to ensure Mexico upholds labor standards as key victories in the deal.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., accompanied by Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Richard Neal, D-Mass., left, speaks at a news conference to discuss the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade agreement, Tuesday, Dec. 10, 2019, on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Californians know that the climate crisis is already here. Communities across our state have experienced exacerbated fires, storms, floods, and drought, and the devastation will only get worse if we fail to take bold and immediate action to address it,\u201d said Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) in a statement.\n\nHarris voted against the deal in the Senate Budget Committee on Tuesday. Brown has acknowledged the deal isn\u2019t perfect and told Yahoo Finance Congress needs to do a better job of addressing climate change.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it plans to use USMCA as a model for future trade negotiations \u2014 so while this the first trade deal to earn Brown\u2019s approval, it may not be the last.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons we fought so hard for this is, we understood if we get this as part of USMCA, it becomes a model for the future. That strong enforceable labor standards, environmental standards, doing the right thing on access to medicines \u2014that can be the core of any trade agreements,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then over time, we'll see trade agreements work in a way that companies are much less likely to outsource jobs from the United States overseas.\u201d\n\nStill, his support for USMCA doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll necessarily get behind the Phase 1 deal with China, which was signed on Wednesday. Brown has urged President Trump to \u201cstay strong\u201d in his negotiations with China. \u201cI want to make sure China's not the same thing and he's not really been open enough about what's in it,\u201d he said.\n\nJessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
