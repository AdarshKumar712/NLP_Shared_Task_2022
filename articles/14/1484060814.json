Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) tweeted. \u201cTrump has rendered America impotent in the Middle East. No one fears us, no one listens to us. America has been reduced to huddling in safe rooms, hoping the bad guys will go away. What a disgrace.\u201d\n\nWhile House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tweeted that \u201cEscalation and violence must end,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said, \u201cWe need to be clear-eyed about reducing tensions and the path forward.\u201d\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) also tweeted that \u201cTrump\u2019s malpractice in the region is making us less safe. Time for Congress to stop this foolish rush to war.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "http://www.iran-daily.com/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"generator": "Tarnama Portal 4.0"}, "canonical_link": ""}
