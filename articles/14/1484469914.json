Keep your New Year\u2019s resolutions list simple and focus on the issues that appear on your list year after year.\n\nSet small attainable goals throughout the year, rather than overwhelming goals. Lifestyle changes are important. Work toward them one step at a time.\n\nLose weight\n\n\u201cHow do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time\u201d \u2013 in this case it would be the reverse. Every time you eat correctly counts.\n\nDon\u2019t see eating something you like that may not be healthy, as cheating. Enjoy and let it go.\n\nDon\u2019t play power games with yourself. In many cases your challenge has little to do with whether you are \u201cweak\u201d or \u201cstrong\u201d willed.\n\nInstead focus on why you want to lose weight and how you will feel when you have achieved your goal. If you are struggling to lose weight it is a good idea to find out exactly why.\n\nAre there underlying health issues?\n\nGet fit\n\nSet clear achievable goals for becoming fit. Join a gym and decide on an achievable amount of times you can go.\n\nUse the staircase at work instead of the lift. Walking is the most natural form of exercise. Start walking.\n\nRegular exercise increases longevity, helps achieve and maintain weight loss, enhances mood, lowers blood pressure, and even improves arthritis.\n\nQuit Smoking\n\nAs with losing weight, the power game thing is important here. It is difficult to stop smoking, but focus on why it is that you want to quit \u2013 healthy lungs, glowing skin, anti-ageing effect, ashtray mouth and breath, saving money \u2013 the list goes on.\n\nAvoid situations that \u201cmake\u201d you reach for that cigarette, at least initially. Try cutting down gradually.\n\nTake a good multivitamin. There are many products and support services available to help you, but ultimately you have to WANT to stop smoking.\n\nDrink Less\n\nWhile many people use the New Year as an incentive to finally stop drinking, most are not equipped to make such a drastic lifestyle change all at once.\n\nMany heavy drinkers fail to quit cold turkey, but do much better when they reduce gradually, or even learn to moderate their drinking.\n\nIf you have decided that you want to stop drinking, there is a world of help and support available.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["local news", "breaking news", "news headlines", "Fourways", "Fourways News headlines", "Local news", "News", "Top stories", "Special categories", "drink less", "get fit", "lifestyle change", "lose weight", "New Year's resolutions", "quit smoking", "realistic goals", "willpower"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Northcliffmelville Times"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 06:30:34 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Some New Year\u2019s Resolutions are pretty much universal, but just 8 per cent of people actually achieve their New Year\u2019s Resolutions.
