I\u2019d love to try the case,\u201d Giuliani told reporters as he made his way into a New Year\u2019s Eve celebration at the president\u2019s Florida resort on Tuesday night.\n\nGiuliani, a former federal prosecutor, suggested he\u2019d lead the president\u2019s defense with a prosecution.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody would have the courage to give me the case, but if you give me the case, I will prosecute it as a racketeering case, which I kind of invented anyway,\u201d he said, referring to his pioneering use of racketeering laws to take down New York mob leadership in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cIt was 30 years ago, but let\u2019s see if I can still do it,\u201d he said.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be any good at it, or if anyone is crazy enough to give me the case, but I would love to be Trump\u2019s impeachment trial lawyer is not exactly the most convincing sales pitch that one could hear.\n\nIf there is one person who could get Donald Trump convicted at a rigged impeachment trial, it\u2019s Rudy Giuliani.\n\nIt would be fascinating and fun to see Rudy Giuliani hijack the Senate for weeks and ramble insane conspiracy theories, as Mitch McConnell loses his mind over Rudy dragging out the trial for days, weeks, or even months.\n\nTrump is not going to allow Giuliani to be his impeachment trial lawyer, but the fact that it is even a possibility suggests that 2020 could be even crazier than 2019.\n\nFor more discussion about this story join our Rachel Maddow and MSNBC group.\n\nFollow Jason Easley on Facebook", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Rudy Giuliani", "Trump impeachment trial lawyer"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Rudy Giuliani is daring Donald Trump to give him the case and allow him to argue in Trump's defense at the president's impeachment trial.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://2vwlfu3ynqxb3npfhm3m8lde-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Politicususa_Favicon_32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Rudy Giuliani Begs To Be Trump\u2019s Impeachment Trial Lawyer", "description": "Rudy Giuliani is daring Donald Trump to give him the case and allow him to argue in Trump's defense at the president's impeachment trial.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.politicususa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rudy-giuliani-liar.jpg", "width": 610, "height": 403}, "url": "https://www.politicususa.com/2020/01/01/rudy-giuliani-begs-to-be-trumps-impeachment-trial-lawyer.html", "site_name": "POLITICUSUSA", "updated_time": "2020-01-01T14:31:18-05:00"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/jason.easley", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA/", "published_time": "2020-01-01T14:31:18-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T14:31:18-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 517456268424921}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rudy Giuliani Begs To Be Trump\u2019s Impeachment Trial Lawyer", "description": "Rudy Giuliani is daring Donald Trump to give him the case and allow him to argue in Trump's defense at the president's impeachment trial.", "image": "https://www.politicususa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rudy-giuliani-liar.jpg", "site": "@politicususa", "creator": "@politicususa"}, "description": "Rudy Giuliani is daring Donald Trump to give him the case and allow him to argue in Trump's defense at the president's impeachment trial.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "generator": "AMP for WP 1.0.6", "news_keywords": "Rudy Giuliani, Trump impeachment trial lawyer", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.politicususa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Politicususa_Favicon_32x32.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.politicususa.com/2020/01/01/rudy-giuliani-begs-to-be-trumps-impeachment-trial-lawyer.html"}
