Those who know Mariyah best would say she is helpful, bright and very caring. She has strong communication skills and is a great advocate for herself. Mariyah has a wide variety of interests which include arts and crafts projects, dance classes, puzzles, and reading. In school, she is very social and has made quite a few friends.\n\nMariyah is legally freed for adoption and would do well in a one or two parent family. If there are other children in the home, it is recommended that they are high school aged or older. Mariyah would do best in a home where there is previous parenting experience. The placement should also have a predictable and consistent schedule for Mariyah but also maintain flexibility. Interested families should be open to maintaining visits and contact with Mariyah\u2019s birth parents and siblings.\n\nFor more information you can contact MARE: 617-964-MARE (6273) or visit www.mareinc.org.\n\nSince its inception in 1981, Wednesday\u2019s Child has been a collaboration of the Massachusetts Adoption Resource Exchange (MARE), the Department of Children & Families and WBZ-TV/CBS Boston. Hosted by Jack Williams for 34 years, this weekly series has given a face and voice to the children who wait the longest for families. Wednesday\u2019s Child has helped find homes for hundreds of waiting children and continues to raise awareness about adoption from foster care.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["how to adopt", "adopting in massachusetts", "adopt a child", "adopt an older child", "mare"], "tags": ["Wednesdays Child", "Boston Next", "Adoption", "It Happens Here"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Those who know Mariyah best would say she is helpful, bright and very caring.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2019/07/cropped-boston-favicon-5121.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "how to adopt, adopting in massachusetts, adopt a child, adopt an older child, mare", "keywords": "how to adopt, adopting in massachusetts, adopt a child, adopt an older child, mare", "fb": {"pages": 7446277009}, "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msvalidate.01": "FDD12CE797EAB78953FDE9ACF7F312A5", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"title": "Wednesday\u2019s Child: 8-Year-Old Mariyah", "image": {"identifier": "https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2019/12/Mariyah-still.jpg", "width": 420, "height": 236}, "description": "Those who know Mariyah best would say she is helpful, bright and very caring.", "type": "article", "url": "https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/01/01/wednesdays-child-adoption-mariyah-2/", "site_name": "CBS Boston", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T11:05:49+00:00", "suggested-social-copy": "Those who know Mariyah best would say she is helpful, bright and very caring.", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSBoston", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSBoston", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T04:47:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2019/12/Mariyah-still.jpg?w=640", "title": "Wednesday's Child: 8-Year-Old Mariyah", "description": "Those who know Mariyah best would say she is helpful, bright and very caring.", "site": "/wbz", "text": {"title": "Wednesday\u2019s Child: 8-Year-Old Mariyah"}}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2019/07/cropped-boston-favicon-5121.png?w=270", "description": "Those who know Mariyah best would say she is helpful, bright and very caring."}, "canonical_link": "https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/01/01/wednesdays-child-adoption-mariyah-2/"}
