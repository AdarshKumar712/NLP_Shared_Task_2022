Read More\n\nAGRA: A 37-year-old bullion trader allegedly killed himself after shooting his wife and two minor children inside his SUV, parked near Vrindavan exit point on Yamuna Expressway early Wednesday morning. While Neeraj Agarwal, his wife Neha (35) and his daughter Dhanya (6), were found dead, his son Shaurya,10, is battling for life at a Delhi hospital.As per documents accessed by TOI, Agarwal was facing multiple inquiries from Income Tax department, commercial tax department and Economic Offences Wing for Rs 123-crore transactions after demonetisation in November 2016. Police say that the Enforcement Directorate was also on his trail and he was under heavy debt. \u201cThese could be likely reasons which pushed him to the brink,\u201d they say.His family, however, claimed that Agarwal was killed at the behest of his business rivals. \u201cSome people had shot at Neeraj two years ago in Govardhan area and a police complaint was filed in this regard. Fortunately, he survived as the bullet nicked just his car,\u201d said his father Dinesh Chandra Agarwal. The family is based in Govindnagar area of Mathura but Neeraj, along with his family, was living in Delhi for the past one year.\u201cNeeraj used to come to Mathura frequently. His wife also hailed from Mathura\u2019s Jaganathpuri area,\u201d his father added. He admitted that some inquiries were going on against him. \u201cBut Neeraj had filed an appeal in the cases and this this could not be the reason for his death,\u201d he said.Police said that the incident took place early Wednesday morning. While Neeraj\u2019s body was found on the driver\u2019s seat of Tuscon, all other three members of his family were on the back seat and had gunshot injuries on their head. The car was locked from inside. According to SP (city) AK Meena, Neeraj\u2019s son was found breathing when the police broke the glass of the car and he was immediately rushed to Nayati hospital from where he was shifted to Apollo hospital, Delhi, as his condition was critical.Meena told TOI that a small note was also found inside the car and the it had been sent to forensic wing for checking its authenticity. Though the note was not clear, it had a mention of some issues related to custom and penalties. He said, police found a pistol in Neeraj\u2019s right hand and he had apparently shot himself on his right temple.Neeraj\u2019s brother-in-law, Amit, told TOI that his sister, Neha and her family had dinner with them and they all appeared happy. \u201cThey had left late on Tuesday night for Delhi as their daughter\u2019s program was scheduled early Wednesday morning,\u201d he told TOI. Amit has filed a complaint in this matter and an FIR is being lodged at police station.In July 2018, the investigation wing of I-T department had conducted a raid at RS Bullion and Jewellers in Mathura, owned by Neeraj Agarwal and Neha Agarwal, and found large-scale anomalies during the period after demonetisation. According to reports, RS Bullion had alone deposited Rs 123 crore cash in bank accounts during demonetisation.After the raid, the I-T officials had told media persons that Neeraj claimed to have sold gold worth Rs 37 crore in a single day, however, records suggested that his firm converted black money of people into white by taking commission. In return, the trader had provided them receipt of gold purchase. Also, the trader, had claimed that he had taken gold stock from a firm in Mumbai \u2014 Vanity Jeweller \u2014 but it was closed down in 2012, much before demonetisation announced.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Agra news", "Agra latest news", "Agra news live", "Agra news today", "Today news Agra", "Vrindavan", "Mathura", "Delhi bullion trader kills wife", "agra"], "tags": ["Mumbai Rains", "Chennai Rains", "Delhi Pollution", "Mumbai Floods", "Srinagar encounter", "Bangalore Rains", "Mathura", "Delhi Earthquake", "Madras High Court"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A 37-year-old bullion trader allegedly killed himself after shooting his wife and two minor children inside his SUV, parked near Vrindavan exit point", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A 37-year-old bullion trader allegedly killed himself after shooting his wife and two minor children inside his SUV, parked near Vrindavan exit point", "keywords": "Agra news, Agra latest news, Agra news live, Agra news today, Today news Agra,Vrindavan,Mathura,Delhi bullion trader kills wife,agra", "og": {"title": "Delhi trader kills wife, daughter before shooting self | Agra News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/delhi-bullion-trader-kills-wife-daughter-before-shooting-self/articleshow/73062134.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064010,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-439614,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "A 37-year-old bullion trader allegedly killed himself after shooting his wife and two minor children inside his SUV, parked near Vrindavan exit point", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/delhi-bullion-trader-kills-wife-daughter-before-shooting-self/articleshow/73062134.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064010,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-439614,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "Delhi trader kills wife, daughter before shooting self | Agra News - Times of India", "description": "A 37-year-old bullion trader allegedly killed himself after shooting his wife and two minor children inside his SUV, parked near Vrindavan exit point", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/delhi-bullion-trader-kills-wife-daughter-before-shooting-self/articleshow/73062134.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 26781952138, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0", "robots": "NOODP"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/delhi-bullion-trader-kills-wife-daughter-before-shooting-self/articleshow/73062134.cms"}
