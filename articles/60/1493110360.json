'The dinner table is neutral ground, it's Switzerland.'.\n\nSoon after, Jojo discovers a Jewish girl called Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie) hiding in a crawl space adjoining the bedroom of his late sister.\n\nThe boy intends to notify authorities but Elsa points out that Jojo's mother would be executed for harbouring a Jew so the boy is compelled to hold his tongue.\n\nJojo Rabbit is a deeply affecting coming-of-age story, which navigates some tricky and delicate changes in pacing and tone, including an unexpected sucker punch to convey one character's fate.\n\nI willingly bought into the satire and sentimentality of Waititi's vision, which affirms the enduring strength of love to light a path through the darkness.\n\n'I think you'll find metal is the strongest thing in the world,' cheerfully counters Jojo.\n\nHe will learn.\n\nSligo Champion", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["independent"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Adapted from Christine Leunen's novel Caging Skies, Jojo Rabbit is a daring comedy drama, which boldly recounts one episode of suffering and redemption during the Second World War throu", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn-01.independent.ie/static/f3105530f7c91bb62317d8976a5029579cb67dd0/img/favicon-independent.ico", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 96796398469, "app_id": 714861305308164}, "keywords": "independent", "description": "Adapted from Christine Leunen's novel Caging Skies, Jojo Rabbit is a daring comedy drama, which boldly recounts one episode of suffering and redemption during the Second World War throu", "news_keywords": "Daring WW2 comedy drama likely to divide audiences - Independent.ie", "og": {"title": "Daring WW2 comedy drama likely to divide audiences - Independent.ie", "site_name": "Independent.ie", "description": "Adapted from Christine Leunen's novel Caging Skies, Jojo Rabbit is a daring comedy drama, which boldly recounts one episode of suffering and redemption during the Second World War throu", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/regionals/sligochampion/lifestyle/daring-ww2-comedy-drama-likely-to-divide-audiences-38844717.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/editorial/images/empty_avatar.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 158, "height": 158}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@Independent_ie", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/regionals/sligochampion/lifestyle/daring-ww2-comedy-drama-likely-to-divide-audiences-38844717.html", "title": "Daring WW2 comedy drama likely to divide audiences", "description": "Adapted from Christine Leunen's novel Caging Skies, Jojo Rabbit is a daring comedy drama, which boldly recounts one episode of suffering and redemption during the Second World War throu", "domain": "Independent.ie"}, "published-date": "Sat, 11 Jan 2020 00:00:00 GMT", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=335158729, app-argument=http://www.independent.ie/regionals/sligochampion/lifestyle/daring-ww2-comedy-drama-likely-to-divide-audiences-38844717.html"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.ie/regionals/sligochampion/lifestyle/daring-ww2-comedy-drama-likely-to-divide-audiences-38844717.html"}
