(stock photo)\n\nA Father-of-one told a garda that he would rape the officer's mother, sister and disabled niece after he became verbally aggressive in a Dublin station.\n\nRichard McNally (31) was annoyed about a push bike which had been taken off him, but he had directed his anger at the wrong person, a court was told.\n\nThe defendant has a \"somewhat short fuse and he needs to learn to lengthen it\", his solicitor said.\n\nJudge Grainne Malone said she could clearly see that the garda had been affected by what McNally had said to him, and she did not think anyone should have to put up with that level of abuse.\n\nJudge Malone imposed a two-month prison sentence.\n\nThe defendant, of Bridgefoot Street in the south inner city, pleaded guilty to engaging in threatening, abusive and insulting behaviour, provoking a breach of the peace.\n\nDublin District Court heard the incident happened at Bridewell Garda Station last September 11.\n\nGarda Joseph Melvin told the court that he was leaving the public office of the station with two other officers at around 1pm when McNally started verbally abusing him and threatened to \"get me back\".\n\nTemper\n\nGda Melvin said McNally then threatened that he would rape the officer's \"mother, sister and handicapped niece\".\n\nGda Melvin said he did not know McNally, the defendant was not under arrest at the time and this was the garda's first time dealing with him.\n\nThe court heard McNally had 115 previous convictions, but had not been in trouble for some time.\n\nDefence solicitor Paul Byrne said his client had a \"bad temper\" and a \"somewhat short fuse\" and he needed to learn to lengthen it.\n\nMr Byrne said McNally accepted that he had said horrific things and had behaved atrociously. He had written a letter of apology to the garda.\n\nIn the letter, McNally had made some reference to a bicycle which had been taken off him, but this had nothing to do with Gda Melvin, the court heard.\n\nJudge Malone said gardai were affected by the abuse hurled at them, particularly when reference was made to family.\n\nShe said she had considered sentencing McNally to community service but she did not believe it was \"sufficient punishment\" and she jailed him for two months.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["herald"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A Father-of-one told a garda that he would rape the officer's mother, sister and disabled niece after he became verbally aggressive in a Dublin station.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn-03.herald.ie/static/65878e062b4890b48f61c325264e809c8a5eee53/img/favicon-herald.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "herald", "description": "A Father-of-one told a garda that he would rape the officer's mother, sister and disabled niece after he became verbally aggressive in a Dublin station.", "news_keywords": "Man threatened to rape garda's mum, sister and disabled niece - Herald.ie", "og": {"title": "Man threatened to rape garda's mum, sister and disabled niece - Herald.ie", "site_name": "Herald.ie", "description": "A Father-of-one told a garda that he would rape the officer's mother, sister and disabled niece after he became verbally aggressive in a Dublin station.", "url": "https://www.herald.ie/news/courts/man-threatened-to-rape-gardas-mum-sister-and-disabled-niece-38827889.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/irish-news/666b1/38827832.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/H9.man-threat.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 607, "height": 342}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@HeraldNewsdesk", "url": "https://www.herald.ie/news/courts/man-threatened-to-rape-gardas-mum-sister-and-disabled-niece-38827889.html", "title": "Man threatened to rape garda's mum, sister and disabled niece", "description": "A Father-of-one told a garda that he would rape the officer's mother, sister and disabled niece after he became verbally aggressive in a Dublin station.", "image": {"src": "https://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/irish-news/666b1/38827832.ece/ALTERNATES/w135square/H9.man-threat.jpg"}, "domain": "Herald.ie"}, "published-date": "Thu, 02 Jan 2020 02:30:00 GMT", "fb": {"app_id": 358672297573810}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.herald.ie/news/courts/man-threatened-to-rape-gardas-mum-sister-and-disabled-niece-38827889.html"}
