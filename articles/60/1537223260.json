The dad was camping with his boy on March 28, 2015, and could not believe that the boy had eaten the cake without permission. That\u2019s when Mauricio Alejandro Torres decided to punish the boy for his misdeed in a way that the boy would surely never forget for the rest of his life.\n\nTorres sexually assaulted the little boy with a dirty stick as a cruel and unusual form of punishment for eating cake without permission. Because Torres attacked his son, Maurice \u201cIsaiah\u201d Torres, he infected him with a bacterial infection that resulted in the boy\u2019s death by sepsis the following day. The stick that dad had used to sexually assault his son had apparently been dirty and brought foreign bacteria into the boy\u2019s body that quickly ate away at his insides, killing him quickly.\n\nTorres, 50, took the boy to the Bella Vista medical clinic near his home the following day; however, it was too late. The boy died from sepsis at the facility, which was near his home in Arkansas.\n\nAfter the abuse, the boy\u2019s father forced the child to endure grueling exercises as further punishment. Dad was not the only one in on the prank. The boy\u2019s mother also abused the child for eating cake, pushing him to the ground.\n\nThe boy\u2019s mother pleaded guilty to capital murder in March 2017. She was given a life sentence in prison.\n\nNow it is Torres\u2019s time to receive his punishment. Because he was the prime abuser in the case that ended the boy\u2019s life, he has been charged with capital murder and battery of the little boy. He pleaded not guilty to the charges, but the court did not take long to review the facts and convict him of his crimes.\n\nTorres was sentenced to death in November 2016 for violently debasing his own son with a stick and killing him. However, the conviction was overturned last year in April because the assault with the stick occurred in Missouri and not Arkansas.\n\nCapital murder cases that carry the death penalty must have occurred in the same state that issued the death penalty. Because the court stupidly overlooked this legal issue, Torres will not be sentenced to death. This technicality means that his original trial was overturned, and he gets a second chance at getting away with murder. He will have to be tried again at Benton County Circuit Court in Arkansas, and the trial will begin on Thursday.\n\nAlthough Torres gets another shot at freedom thanks to the justice system\u2019s failure, he faces severe penalties if he gets convicted. He faces up to life in prison or the death penalty if he gets convicted for the capital murder charge. If he gets convicted of the battery charges, he faces five to twenty years in prison.\n\nThe original medical examiner testified that Isaiah\u2019s death was caused by a bacterial infection from the stick that was used to sexually assault him.\n\nWhat do you think about this father\u2019s crimes against his son?\n\nEvery time you share an AWM story, you help build a home for a disabled veteran.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//static.awm.com/wp-content/themes/awm/assets/images/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"robots": "noindex, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "fb": {"pages": 1728632947366607, "app_id": 435933486603092}, "og": {"site_name": "AWM", "type": "article", "image": "https://awm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dad-assaults-boy-with-stick-feat.png", "title": "Six-Year-Old Boy Dies Of Infection After Dad Punishes Him With A Dirty Stick", "url": "https://awm.com/six-year-old-boy-dies-of-infection-after-dad-punishes-him-with-a-dirty-stick/", "description": "When a little boy ate cake during a camping trip, his father was furious."}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AWMcom/", "modified_time": "2020-03-03 09:14:21"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "When a little boy ate cake during a camping trip, his father was furious.", "title": "Six-Year-Old Boy Dies Of Infection After Dad Punishes Him With A Dirty Stick", "site": "@awmamerica", "image": "https://awm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dad-assaults-boy-with-stick-feat.png", "creator": "@awmamerica"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.5"}, "canonical_link": "https://awm.com/six-year-old-boy-dies-of-infection-after-dad-punishes-him-with-a-dirty-stick/"}
