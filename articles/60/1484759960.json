Norton has been one of the most impressive comedy stories of the past decade, transforming from part-time performer to must-see headliner at night, all while waking up early as part of KS95\u2019s morning show. This show is definitely worth the drive out to the \u2018burbs. 8:30 p.m. $19. 2749 Winnetka Ave. N., New Hope; 763-417-0017.\n\nNew Year\u2019s Eve Comedy and Dance Party\n\nDance Love Studio\n\nWhy choose between comedy, dancing, and partying into the New Year? Dance Love Studio will have the best of all three on New Year\u2019s Eve, with comedians Ali Sultan, Greg Coleman, Shawn Nasfstad, and Abenezer Merdassa providing the jokes. Sultan and Coleman are two of the most seasoned headliners in town, and both are worth the price of admission on their own. Meanwhile, Nafstad and Merdassa are two of the fastest-rising up-and-coming voices in comedy, and will likely find themselves headlining their own New Year\u2019s Eve shows in 2020. Get there early, as the comedy will get the party started for the evening at 9 p.m. From there, you can get up and move with a mini dance lesson from Hanna Esparza, then hit the open floor starting at 10:45 p.m. with DJ Salman and DJ Luv. You\u2019ll be able to countdown to the New Year at midnight, celebrate with a toast, sloppily hug and high-five everyone, and then keep the party going until 2 a.m. 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. $20/$30 at the door. 2601 Second Ave. S., Minneapolis.\n\nEast Coast-Style New Year\u2019s Eve\n\nSisyphus Brewing\n\nFor anyone who loves to celebrate but also likes going to bed a reasonable time, Maggie Faris has your back. Faris is once again presenting her East Coast-Style New Year\u2019s Eve event, with a stacked lineup of comedians and plenty of surprises. The best part? Each show ends with a full-blown New Year\u2019s countdown (the late show ends at 11 p.m., or midnight on the East Coast -- get it?), with champagne and confetti and all the pomp and circumstance you could ask for $25 bucks. This year\u2019s shows will feature Faris, alongside Amber Preston, who made her mark as an Acme regular before taking over Los Angeles the past several years, and headliner David Dyer, who is best known as part of the Bob and Tom radio show. One of the staples of Faris\u2019 events has become her affinity for booby prizes, and this year\u2019s East Coast blowout will be no exception. Trust us, they will be ridiculous. There are two sets, giving you plenty of time to get home and relieve the babysitter before the \u201creal\u201d parties start, or sneak off to another bar to watch the ball drop and countdown to midnight for real. 7 and 9 p.m. $25. 712 Ontario Ave. W., Minneapolis; 612-444-8674.\n\nAlso, these comedy shows are recommended by City Pages writers:\n\n\n\nLizz Winstead: Sharknado X\n\nThe Cedar Cultural Center\n\nWhen recounting the entire history of civilization, the last 10 years is just a blip. But when you\u2019re living through a decade of political malaise, cultural anxiety, economic uncertainty, and environmental deterioration, things can feel like a series of escalating catastrophes. Thankfully Lizz Winstead, the socially astute comic who co-created satirical news staple The Daily Show, has been here all the while to provide cathartic laughter at her popular New Year\u2019s Eve retrospectives. In recapping a 365 days worth of absurdities, Winstead brings an insightful perspective, infusing the most exasperating events with much needed levity. That said, even Winstead\u2019s formidable comic skills are certain to be tested when consolidating an entire irrational decade into one hilarious presentation. Winstead, accompanied by guitarist Sam Breckenridge, will evoke laughter from this period of prolonged tension, hopefully imbuing a bit of hope as we enter a new decade. 7:30 p.m. $50/$60; $70 VIP. 416 Cedar Ave. S., Minneapolis; 612-338-2674. --Brad Richason\n\nSean Donnelly\n\nRick Bronson's House of Comedy\n\n\u201cI\u2019m newly divorced, which is a bit of a bummer. But I\u2019m doing good,\u201d says comedian Sean Donnelly. \u201cI just did a spot on Tracy Morgan\u2019s show, The Last O.G., playing a security guard, and I\u2019ve been doing tons of standup as usual.\u201d Onstage, Donnelly is talking about everything from U.F.O.s to social media. \u201cI had A.D.D. as a kid,\u201d he says of the latter. \u201cSocial media is like my brain, but as a collective unit. After a few days, we can\u2019t remember what we were upset about or who we were mad at.\u201d Donnelly reckons we\u2019re headed back to 1996 as people back away from social media. \u201cI already see it happening. People say, \u2018I check my email and maybe look up a recipe.\u2019 Even the tech companies have caught on, offering features that let you lock yourself out of the internet for awhile.\u201d He likens it to how bars were years ago. \u201cThey used to say in bars, \u2018No politics or religion.\u2019 I think that\u2019s kind of good. I\u2019m not saying we can\u2019t talk about things, but we can still be friends and have different opinions. Family members are unfriending each other. People need to chill out. One thing doesn\u2019t define a person.\u201d 7 and 10 p.m. $25-$55.95. 408 E. Broadway, Mall of America, Bloomington; 952-858-8558. --P.F. Wilson\n\nBengt Washburn\n\nAcme Comedy Co.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in an airport in Costa Rica,\u201d Bengt Washburn tells us. \u201cI did a cruise ship gig last week and this is where I get off.\u201d For years, working the boats, as they say, wasn\u2019t the most desirable gig in comedy, but Washburn says times have changed. \u201cI don\u2019t mind it,\u201d he says. \u201cOlder audiences now are pretty hip. When I first started, they didn\u2019t know what standup was. Now, if you have an audience of 50 and 60 year olds, they know who Carlin is; they get it.\u201d Washburn doesn\u2019t work blue, but there are still things that seem otherwise innocuous that he can\u2019t joke about on ships. \u201cI still do clubs. That\u2019s where I do the writing,\u201d he says. His PG/PG-13 style earned him two specials on Dry Bar Comedy, a website and production company that favors clean standup. \u201cMy last special for them was called Not Bad,\u201d he explains. \u201cAt Acme, I\u2019ll be doing the \u2018Sort of Bad\u2019 show. It\u2019s all the stuff from Not Bad, but not truncated. It goes a little further.\u201d For example, he\u2019ll be able to touch on some social and political topics that he couldn\u2019t do at sea. \u201cThat would start a fight on a ship,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut it would be pretty funny given the age group. Someone would tip over and die.\u201d 8 and 10:30 p.m. $30; $60 with dinner. 708 N. First St., Minneapolis; 612-338-6393. --P.F. Wilson\n\nOther great shows set for New Year\u2019s Eve:\n\nResolution 2020: A Zero Proof New Year's Eve\n\nThe Parkway Theater\n\nThis all ages, sober show features music from HALEY and Lydia Liza, plus comedian Moe Yaqub. 9 p.m. $45/$55 at the door; $75 VIP. 4814 Chicago Ave., Minneapolis; 612-822-8080.\n\n\n\nBob Stromberg\n\nWith a Mexican buffet and music from DJ Scott Rousseau. 8 p.m. $40-$50.
