How can there be a third fatality when there weren't any at all yesterday?\" a Greek foreign ministry spokesman said.\n\nThe report further cited Mitsotakis as saying that Turkey had become \"the official trafficker of migrants to the European Union\" and was using \"desperate people to promote this geopolitical agenda and to divert attention from the horrible situation in Syria\".\n\nMeanwhile, UN refugee has questioned the Greek government's move to suspend all asylum applications for one month.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["European migrant crisis", "Decades", "Immigration", "Units of time", "Ankara", "Kyriakos Mitsotakis", "Prime Minister", "Athens", "Turkey", "European Union", "asylum applications", "foreign ministry spokesman", "president", "United Nations", "Recep Tayyip Erdogan", "Greece", "Greek"], "tags": ["Politics"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Read more about Amid migrant influx from Turkey, EU leaders praise Greece as Europe's 'shield' on Business Standard.
