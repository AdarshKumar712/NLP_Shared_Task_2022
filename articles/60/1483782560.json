Participants are treated to guided and self-guided hikes, hot chocolate and soup, and the fellowship of like-minded winter adventurers.\n\nBut with all that good stuff comes lots of discarded bowls, spoon and cups, and carbon emissions from cars carrying those adventurers to and from the parks.\n\nWhile Metro Parks is thrilled that so many people have latched onto the hike series, they also want to be good stewards of the environment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to provide the experience, but we also don\u2019t want to make a mess of this world,\u201d said Jill Snyder, assistant manager of education and interpretation.\n\nTo that end, Metro Parks started a few years ago to encourage participants to carpool to the hikes and bring their own reusable mugs and bowls. Hikers also can earn commemorative mugs by donating five cans of food, five personal hygeine items, or $5 to the Mid Ohio Food Bank.\n\nThis year, the park system is ramping up its conservation efforts even more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really trying to reduce waste from the event,\u201d Snyder said.\n\nTo do that, Metro Parks is using compostable bowls and utensils where possible in place of styrofoam and plastic. They have partnered with The Compost Exchange, which will compost refuse and food waste from the hikes, as well as educate hikers about composting. In addition to the mugs hikers can earn with food bank donations, the Friends of the Metro Parks are selling reusable bowls and spoons.\n\n\u201cWe hope to divert a whole lot of trash from the landfill,\u201d Snyder said.\n\nMetro Parks staffers plan to track just how much waste they divert.\n\n\u201cIf we hit certain goals, we\u2019re going to save the turtles\u2013not sea turtles, but our own Ohio turtles,\u201d Snyder said.\n\nThe idea is to provide better habitat and resources for protection of turtles, especially box turtles, whose numbers are declining due to habitat loss and fragmentation. (Turtles are getting hit on roads, including those within the parks, that bisect their living areas.) Additionally, a new nature center planned for Blacklick Woods Metro Park in Reynoldsburg will include an educational component on turtles.\n\nSo, what do turtles have to do with waste reduction?\n\n\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s hard to get people excited about trash\u2026 This way, we\u2019re saying that if we can get everyone on board with our conservation efforts, we as a Metro Park district will give back to protecting the environment,\u201d Snyder said.\n\nThis year\u2019s motto for the Winter Hike Series is \u201cHike to a Greener Place.\u201d For more information, go to metroparks.net.\n\nSchedule\n\nThe 47th Annual Winter Hike Series, presented by Columbus and Franklin County Metro Parks, runs Jan. 4-Feb. 22.\n\nAnyone who completes at least seven hikes receives an embroidered patch. Anyone who completes all 13 hikes and is a paying member of the Friends of the Metro Parks receives a walking stick and/or a medallion for the stick. Friends membership is $10 per year. This year\u2019s medallion pays tribute to the Scioto Audubon Metro Park.\n\nDates, times, places and distances for each of this year\u2019s hikes are as follows:\n\nJan. 4\u201310 a.m., Blacklick Woods in Reynoldburg, 2 or 4 miles;\n\nJan. 11\u201310 a.m., Sharon Woods in Westerville, 2 or 4 miles, pets welcome;\n\nJan. 12\u20132 p.m., Prairie Oaks in West Jefferson, 1, 3 or 5 miles, pets welcome;\n\nJan. 18\u201310 a.m., Scioto Audubon, downtown Columbus, 1 or 2 miles, pets welcome;\n\nJan. 25\u201310 a.m., Clear Creek in Rockbridge, 1, 3 or 5 miles;\n\nJan. 26\u20132 p.m., Inniswood in Westerville, 2 miles;\n\nFeb. 1\u201310 a.m., Blendon Woods in northeast Columbus, 2 or 4 miles;\n\nFeb. 2\u20132 p.m., Scioto Grove in Grove City, 1 or 2 miles, pets welcome;\n\nFeb. 8\u201310 a.m., Highbanks in Lewis Center, 2.5 or 5 miles;\n\nFeb. 9\u20132 p.m., Glacier Ridge in Plain City, 2 miles, pets welcome;\n\nFeb. 15\u201310 a.m., Three Creeks in Groveport, 1, 3 or 5.6 miles, pets welcome;\n\nFeb. 16\u20132 p.m., Slate Run in Canal Winchester, 2.5 or 5 miles; and\n\nFeb. 22\u201310 a.m., Battelle Darby Creek in Galloway, 2, 4 or 6 miles, pets welcome.\n\nHikes are free.
