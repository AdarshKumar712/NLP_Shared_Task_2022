With around 60% of the vote currently being reported, Sanders has a commanding lead over presumptive second-place finisher, former Vice President Joe Biden, according to The New York Times, 46% to 19%. Former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg is in third with 15%, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is holding on to fourth place with just over 10%.\n\nThe victory was decisive for the Vermont socialist and brutal for Sanders\u2019 competitors. The Associated Press reports that, combined, Biden, Buttigieg, and Warren, took only 45% of the vote to Sanders\u2019 46%, neatly demonstrating that a combined \u201cmoderate\u201d vote in Nevada could not have unseated Sanders, despite the fact that he moved into first place just two weeks ago.\n\nTrump seemed happy about the results, tweeting that Sanders was \u201cdoing well\u201d in the \u201cGreat State of Nevada.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks like Crazy Bernie is doing well in the Great State of Nevada,\u201d Trump said on social media. \u201cBiden & the rest look weak, & no way Mini Mike can restart his campaign after the worst debate performance in the history of Presidential Debates. Congratulations Bernie, & don\u2019t let them take it away from you.\u201d\n\nFormer New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg still poses a challenge to Sanders, not on the campaign trail \u2014 Bloomberg won\u2019t even be on the ballot in a primary until Super Tuesday \u2014 but definitely in the back rooms of the Democratic party. Hollywood, the media, and Washington Democrats\u2019 seem increasingly supportive of the former mayor\u2019s bid, particularly now as the far-left Sanders seems all but unstoppable.\n\nBloomberg himself called Sanders\u2019 win a \u201cfatal error.\u201d\n\nSanders, who spent millions on offices and staffers ahead of the Nevada caucuses, had only good news.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to bring you some very good news. I think all of you know we won the popular vote in Iowa. We won the New Hampshire primary,\u201d Sanders said in an \u201cacceptance\u201d speech at a rally in San Antonio, Texas, Saturday night. \u201cAnd, according to three networks and the AP, we have now won the Nevada caucus.\u201d\n\nTrump is, no doubt, pleased with the outcome, given that conventional wisdom says Sanders is the weakest against the president\u2019s 2020 re-election bid. But his victory is, by no means, secured. Despite naysayers, progressive Democrats seem to believe that a movement is \u201ccohering\u201d around the Vermont socialist, and that movement Democrats will come around Sanders when he\u2019s the only option to unseat President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Trump remains steadfastly popular, and despite Sanders\u2019 win, turned out more than 15,000 to a rally in Las Vegas on Saturday, according to the Nevada Independent. He tried to drive home, to Nevada\u2019s millions of unionized workers, that Sanders\u2019 message of economic unity might ultimately end up hurting workers.\n\n\u201cA lot of the Democrats are going to ruin the health care programs that these unions have,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe unions have worked hard on health care, and they\u2019re going to ruin them. You\u2019re going to lose 180 million people off of great private health care.\u201d\n\nThe next Democratic contest is February 29th in South Carolina.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Bernie Sanders", "Donald Trump"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "President Donald Trump weighed in on the Nevada Democratic caucuses overnight, congratulating Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders on his big win and warning the Democratic socialist that the Democratic National Committee might try to \u201csteal\u201d Sanders\u2019 victory.
