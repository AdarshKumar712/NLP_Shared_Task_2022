Both claims were dismissed.\n\nProf Pitcher is appealing that decision.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 13:31:02 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Oxford University could appeal a landmark ageism case after an employment tribunal ruled the dismissal of a physics professor 'unfair'.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/resources/images/1811631/", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "OMG-Verify-V1": "4389-366acdfc-5224-4c07-bb70-f74d8fbfc2db", "og": {"url": "https://www.heraldseries.co.uk/news/18131930.oxford-university-professor-wins-age-discrimination-battle/", "site_name": "Herald Series", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.heraldseries.co.uk/resources/images/10405919/", "width": 650, "height": 433}, "title": "Oxford University professor wins age discrimination battle", "type": "website", "name": "Oxford University professor wins age discrimination battle", "description": "Oxford University could appeal a landmark ageism case after an employment tribunal ruled the dismissal of a physics professor 'unfair'."}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.heraldseries.co.uk/resources/images/10405919/"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Oxford University professor wins age discrimination battle", "description": "Oxford University could appeal a landmark ageism case after an employment tribunal ruled the dismissal of a physics professor 'unfair'."}, "fb": {"app_id": 153511901373078}, "medium": "news", "title": "Oxford University professor wins age discrimination battle", "description": "Oxford University could appeal a landmark ageism case after an employment tribunal ruled the dismissal of a physics professor 'unfair'."}, "canonical_link": "http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/18131930.oxford-university-professor-wins-age-discrimination-battle/"}
