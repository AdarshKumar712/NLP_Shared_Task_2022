Philadelphia was also where Barack Obama delivered a heralded speech on race relations more than 12 years ago, titled \u201cA More Perfect Union.\u201d\n\nPart of the Biden speech will speak to the nation\u2019s concerns over police brutality, with plans to use the words of George Floyd \u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2014 as a mantra.
