The news is not unexpected given Sprint\u2019s current position in the market, as the fourth largest carrier has continued to bleed subscribers.\n\nIn fact, one of the arguments the companies made in their court case was that, without a merger, Sprint would not have the ability to continue forward as a national carrier. Instead, it would likely have to abandon a number of markets and settle for being a regional carrier.\n\nGiven the situation, it\u2019s unlikely Sprint parent SoftBank will put up too much of a fight, although there are no guarantees. SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son ended the previous round of merger negotiations in 2017 because of a dispute over which company should have the controlling interest in a combined T-Mobile. In spite of the fact that Sprint was already losing ground and T-Mobile\u2019s future was looking brighter than ever, Son wanted SoftBank to have the controlling interest in the merged company, not Deutsche Telekom.\n\nConsidering how far Sprint has fallen, however, Son may not have much room to negotiate this time around.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Sprint", "Masayoshi Son", "T-Mobile", "wireless", "Deutsche Telekom", "5G", "Merger", "Victor Marrero", "SoftBank"], "authors": ["Matt Milano"], "publish_date": "Fri Feb 14 01:54:57 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "T-Mobile and Sprint may have been cleared for their merger by U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero, but T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom may be going back to the drawing board in some respects.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i0.wp.com/www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cropped-wpn_siteidentity-7.png?fit=32%2C32&ssl=1", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "T-Mobile and Sprint may have been cleared for their merger by U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero, but T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom may be going back to the drawing board in some respects.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Deutsche Telekom Renegotiating Sprint Deal", "description": "T-Mobile and Sprint may have been cleared for their merger by U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero, but T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom may be going back to the drawing board in some respects.", "url": "https://www.webpronews.com/deutsche-telekom-renegotiating-sprint-deal/", "site_name": "WebProNews", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sprint-t-mobile.jpg?fit=743%2C380&ssl=1"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebProNews/", "published_time": "2020-02-14T01:54:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-19T12:38:07+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/NeXTLoop", "site": "@webpronews", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Matt Milano", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.68.0", "fb": {"pages": 7727219941}, "google-adsense-platform-account": "ca-host-pub-2644536267352236", "google-adsense-platform-domain": "sitekit.withgoogle.com", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cropped-wpn_siteidentity-7.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.webpronews.com/deutsche-telekom-renegotiating-sprint-deal/"}
