With the enrollment increases the school has made, now surpassing 4,000 students, the number of graduates has also increased, up from the 169 students who graduated this time last year.\n\nMidwestern Seminary also celebrated a noteworthy milestone during the commencement ceremony, as 29 Spanish-speaking church planters earned their Church Planting Certificates. Two of those graduates also received their Master\u2019s in Theological Studies with an emphasis on Pastoral Ministry.\n\nFelix Cabrera, assistant professor of pastoral ministry and Spanish church relations coordinator, helped pioneer the certificate program in 2017. \u201cWhat happened today is epic and historic. The pilot program is no longer a pilot,\u201d Cabrera shared. \u201cMinisterial experience combined with theological education is an ideal scenario for these pastors who serve in the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Mexico, Paraguay, Nicaragua, and Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot be more pleased that these men have worked so hard and accomplished so much through our Spanish Language programs,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThis is \u2018for the Church\u2019 in action, as they will now go and establish local churches and proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nKicking off the 10-part graduation/convocation sermon series focusing on significant, urgent doctrinal issues\u2014including topics such as the sufficiency of Scripture, the exclusivity of the gospel, and penal substitutionary atonement\u2014Allen noted there\u2019s no better place to begin than with biblical inerrancy. As such, he preached a message from Jude entitled, \u201cTruths Worth Contending For: Biblical Inerrancy.\u201d\n\nAllen said that, as Southern Baptists, there is never a wrong time to reassert, cling to, and contend for one of our central and foundational truths.\n\nHe affirmed biblical inerrancy as the belief that the Bible is without error. \u201cIt\u2019s an argument for the truthfulness of God\u2019s word. It is divinely inspired, comprehensively truthful and, thus, authoritative for life and doctrine. It is from this inerrant Word that we can know our inerrant savior, Jesus Christ. \u2026\n\nTo view Allen\u2019s commencement address, visit https://www.mbts.edu/2019/12/sixty-sixth-commencement-address/.\n\nTo learn more about Midwestern\u2019s Spanish Language programs, visit https://www.mbts.edu/degrees/spanish-studies/. \u03bd", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Pat Hudson", "Diana Chandler", "Miles Mullin", "Brian Koonce"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Midwestern Seminary also celebrated a noteworthy milestone during the commencement ceremony, as 29 Spanish-speaking church planters earned their Church Planting Certificates.
