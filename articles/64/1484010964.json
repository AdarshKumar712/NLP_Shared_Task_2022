New data from Paychex | IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch confirms the trend of rising wages, with workers both working longer and earning more in December.\n\nPaychex-IHS noted \u201csteady growth in hourly earnings and hours worked\u201d -- with the latter posting the strongest gains since 2012. Meanwhile, weekly earnings growth to new highs for small businesses:\n\n\u201cSmall business job gains have flattened in the second half of the year as labor markets prove very tight,\u201d said James Diffley, chief regional economist at IHS Markit. \u201cIn response, weekly earnings have accelerated, surging from 2.49 percent mid-year to 4.13 percent at year-end.\u201d \u201cThe new high seen in weekly earnings growth this month is certainly positive news for the employees of small businesses,\u201d said Martin Mucci, Paychex president and CEO. \u201cNot only are businesses raising wages, but they\u2019re also increasing hours for their current employees, a sure sign employers are responding to the pressures of the tight labor market.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nPaychex-IHS\u2019s figures also found that the South is the best region for small business jobs, while the West has seen the strongest earnings growth.\n\n\u2014\n\n10:00 a.m. ET: Consumer confidence climbs, but disappoints\n\nThe Conference Board\u2019s index of consumer confidence climbed to 126.5 in December from 125.5 in November. This was just shy of the 128.5 economists were expecting.\n\n\u201cWhile consumers\u2019 assessment of current conditions improved, their expectations declined, driven primarily by a softening in their short-term outlook regarding jobs and financial prospects,\u201d the Conference Board\u2019s Lynn Franco said. \u201cWhile the economy hasn\u2019t shown signs of further weakening, there is little to suggest that growth, and in particular consumer spending, will gain momentum in early 2020.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\n9:37 a.m. ET: Stocks open flat\n\nMarkets opened lower to kick off a holiday-shortened week.
