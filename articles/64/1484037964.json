The city and the Yorba Linda Chamber of Commerce equally share proceeds from the annual event, which this year totaled $21,000, making $10,600 available for five grants of $2,000 maximum between now through December 2020, according to a city staff report.\n\nThe grants will assist the city\u2019s business community in enhancing retail shopping, the report said. The program, which was unanimously approved by the City Council earlier in December, would allow merchants, retail centers, and business groups to promote their businesses.\n\nEligibility for the grant comes with some guidelines. A business must express a need for improvement to a building exterior or common area, according to the staff report. It must also explain how the enhancement will provide a benefit to the community and demonstrate a need for the grant that cannot be obtained through other funding options.\n\nThe application process includes a project description, plans, drawings or photos, and a budget. The city plans to review these applications within 15 days of submittal to the economic development manager with a final decision by the city manager, according to the staff report.\n\nThe City Council meets every first and third Tuesday of the month at 4845 Casa Loma Ave.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Evidence Booking Scandal", "Angels Negotiations", "Election 2020"], "authors": ["Lauryn Yost"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 06:58:19 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "7 SharesTweet1Share6EmailFive businesses will be eligible to apply for a $2,000 grant to improve their retail environment in the first year of a new economic development program in Yorba Linda.
