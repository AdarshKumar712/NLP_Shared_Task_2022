The Top 10 stories ranked by their significance by our writers is very different from the Top 10 stories you searched for and clicked on at The Thaiger.\n\nSome other stats. You clicked on The Thaiger 81,177,191 times (up to December 29) during 2019, the busiest month was October where you clicked on The Thaiger 18.3 million times. We started the year with 3 staff and finished the year with 19.\n\nFrom the bizarre to the informative, YOUR top choices reflect a trend for stories that aren\u2019t necessarily about politics and climate change! Here are the top 10 most popular Thaiger stories for 2019, from the most clicked-on story down to number 10.\n\nNumber One\n\nWith 151,000 views, this story captured your imagination more than anything else in 2019. Hmmmm. Of all the reasons you may end up in a Thai hospital, this is not a common one. Although doctors and nurses did send us plenty of follow up emails attesting to any number of kitchen utensils, fruit and appliances having much the same predicament. Men allegedly fall over with a similar result quite often leaving them in a less-than-graceful pose at their nearest medical establishment.\n\nMay 2020 be the year you don\u2019t fall over!\n\nNumber Two\n\nThe tropical storm \u2018Pabuk\u2019 was well predicted in the week before it eventually made landfall in Thailand. Our video explanation of the storm was also our most-watched video this year. Good preparations reduced the amount of destruction caused by the storm.\n\nNumber Three\n\nVisas, the tightening of enforcement, a few new rules and the alleged exodus of expats were popular topics this year. Immigration police seemingly changed their stance from \u2018Good guys in, bad guys out\u2019 to \u2018Bad guys out, good guys out\u2019 if you believe a lot of the commentary circulating around the local chatrooms this year. The net result is that expats in Thailand rose in 2019 with Japanese and Chinese being the highest number of new expats for the past twelve months.\n\nNumber Four\n\nMoving past the medical, weather and immigration Top 3, people also wanted to research living in the Land of Smiles. Our most popular information story was an honest look at some of the issues that expats pose when they live in Thailand. A holiday is a very different experience to full time life in Thailand.\n\nTop 10 hard truths of living as an expat in Thailand | The Thaiger\n\nPHOTO: Number Seven in the \u201chard truths of living as an expat in Thailand\u201d \u2013 the bar girls don\u2019t actually love you.\n\nNumber Five\n\nThe Bangkok bombings in August, a series of small bombs primarily detonated as a \u2018warning\u2019 rather to inflict a lot of damage, reminded us that there are still problems the Kingdom has to address before peace can fully descend on the country. Although the trials are still ongoing, it is thought that this series of explosions around the capital were related to the insurgency in the deep south of Thailand.\n\nNumber Six\n\nThere isn\u2019t any prostitution in Thailand. Until someone makes a rare and unlikely spotting (cough) or an NGO goes combing through some of the tourist red light districts and reports it. Sometimes the Pattaya police needed some outside assistance to locate some of the reported 30,000 prostitutes working in the seaside party town.\n\nNumber Seven\n\nJust like the prostitutes, the scams really don\u2019t exist. Unless you\u2019re almost 100% of tourists and expats, even locals, who fall for one of the many clever schemes concocted by locals to extract money from you. A few minutes on the internet will usually save people from all sorts of inconvenience and losing their money. We listed 10 popular scams in Thailand.\n\nTop 10 scams in Thailand\n\nNumber Eight\n\nRoad crashes are always clickable stories. The Thaiger has a policy of only reporting road deaths when there are significant numbers, dangerous locations or prominent people \u2013 in this case it was the horrifying death of the son of a popular music label owner. Thailand remains as one of the most dangerous places to drive in the world, although the vast majority of death statistics are of males, under 24 and riding a motorbike at the time.\n\nNumber Nine\n\nThere was plenty of online chatter about Thai immigration officials \u2018tightening the screws\u2019 on long-stay visas over the year. The issue was more of tighter enforcement rather than any new guidelines. But the TM28 and 30 forms were much discussed, at length.\n\nNumber 10\n\nAnother of our Top 10 lists was another popular story for 2019. This time we took a cheeky look at the types of expats moving to Thailand. We also had plenty of other suggestions from readers. We\u2019ll update the list in 2020 with some of the suggestions\u2026 well the ones we can publish anyway.\n\nKeep in contact with The Thaiger by following our Facebook page", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Greeley Pulitzer", "The Thaiger"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 05:47:15 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The past decade has been challenging for Thailand's legacy airline whilst newer, more nimble and cashed-up players enter the market.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://thethaiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/thaiger-t-logo-150x150.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The past decade has been challenging for Thailand's legacy airline whilst newer, more nimble and cashed-up players enter the market.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Thailand set to launch two more budget airlines in 2020 | The Thaiger", "description": "The past decade has been challenging for Thailand's legacy airline whilst newer, more nimble and cashed-up players enter the market.", "url": "https://thethaiger.com/hot-news/tourism/thailand-set-to-launch-two-more-budget-airlines-in-2020", "site_name": "The Thaiger", "image": {"identifier": "https://thethaiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/jet_airliner_airbus_a330_200_generic_01.jpg", "secure_url": "https://thethaiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/jet_airliner_airbus_a330_200_generic_01.jpg", "width": 920, "height": 497}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thethaigernews/", "section": "Tourism", "published_time": "2019-12-31T05:47:15+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 278079612671192, "pages": 411726205571880}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The past decade has been challenging for Thailand's legacy airline whilst newer, more nimble and cashed-up players enter the market.", "title": "Thailand set to launch two more budget airlines in 2020 | The Thaiger", "site": "@ThaigerNews", "image": "https://thethaiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/jet_airliner_airbus_a330_200_generic_01.jpg", "creator": "@ThaigerNews"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "google-site-verification": "zX2S1V0VTXII-6z7_jSi1iu8REB9LCRxtb2b43Z4WNw", "msvalidate.01": "8319E2363C1B78E6BC48629BBE79E49D", "pocket-site-verification": "207bb41f2483d4f5ae620ecc421d70", "p": {"domain_verify": "dfde0c8ea2e2afb6c4ec01532f5cb3ee"}}, "canonical_link": "https://thethaiger.com/hot-news/tourism/thailand-set-to-launch-two-more-budget-airlines-in-2020"}
