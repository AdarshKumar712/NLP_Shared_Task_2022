More than 1,000 care home managers and staff have participated in webinars organised by MSF to share knowledge and experience about ways to continue providing the best care possible in ways that are safe and that maximise the effect of \u2018shielding\u2019 the residents.\n\n\u201cAs a society, we will need to have a good think about why the priority in this pandemic has been hospitals and other medical facilities, and why barely a thought has been given to the most vulnerable,\u201d says Dr di Lollo. \u201cThat will need to change.\u201d\n\nMSF will continue our approach of seeking out the most vulnerable groups of people and seeing how best to respond. Other projects in EU countries are addressing the needs of homeless people, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants, and prison detainees and guards.\n\nOur teams are also preparing every project in the 70 countries where we work to be COVID-ready as the epidemic sweeps around the globe; we\u2019ve also started caring for patients with COVID-19 in countries across Africa, central Asia and Latin America. As in the EU, MSF teams will seek out the greatest need and the greatest vulnerability as the guiding principles of our response.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "COVID-19 has taken a heavy toll in care homes for elderly people, who need a special level of care.
