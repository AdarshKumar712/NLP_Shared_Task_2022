Ryan Tannehill, Tennessee Titans</strong></p><p><strong>7. Teddy Bridgewater, Saints</strong></p><p><span>Don't get your hopes up. We listed seven quarterbacks, but most of these guys are unlikely to hit free agency. For various reasons, it's hard to imagine Brees, Brady or Rivers playing anywhere else. Prescott and the Cowboys have been negotiating for what feels like forever, and it's possible that Prescott, Winston and Tannehill all get hit by franchise tags before sniffing the open market. </span></p><p><span>So it's possible—maybe even likely—that Bridgewater is the top quarterback to actually become available, although there's also an outside chance that a veteran like <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/cameron-newton">Cam Newton</a> or <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/nick-foles">Nick Foles</a> becomes unemployed between now and the start of free agency. </span></p><p><span>But for now, we'll focus on these seven, none of whom are under contract beyond this spring. Brees and Brady, who rank first and second on the all-time passing touchdowns <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_td_career.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list</a>, will both have the last two years of their current deals <a href="https://twitter.com/BenVolin/status/1158455546418278400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">void</a> on the eve of the new league year. But they're the two oldest position players in pro football, and new contracts in New Orleans and New England are likely. And even if those deals don't come together, it's possible either (or both) could retire. </span></p><p><span>Rivers has said he's <a href="https://twitter.com/danielrpopper/status/1211406508170391557?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open to playing elsewhere</a>, and an argument can be made that the Chargers should move on after another disappointing season with the offense under his tutelage. However, his numbers plummeted in 2019, so it's difficult to imagine another team taking a risk on the 38-year-old. </span></p><p><span>The Cowboys don't sound as though they're willing to <a href="https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/all-eyes-return-to-cooper-dak-contracts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">part with Prescott</a>, so after a 30-touchdown season, the franchise tag is there if needed. Ditto for the Bucs and Winston, especially after <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001089895/article/buccaneers-slated-to-bring-back-jameis-winston-for-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL Network's Ian Rapoport</a> reported last week that the plan is to bring him back for 2020.

The position has been severely devalued for a reason, but this offseason's free-agent class still looks quite special.  </p><p>It of course starts with Henry, who led the league in rushing yards, was tied for the NFL lead with 16 rushing touchdowns and <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&year_min=2019&year_max=2019&season_start=1&season_end=-1&pos%5B%5D=rb&draft_year_min=1936&draft_year_max=2019&draft_slot_min=1&draft_slot_max=500&draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&conference=any&draft_pos%5B%5D=qb&draft_pos%5B%5D=rb&draft_pos%5B%5D=wr&draft_pos%5B%5D=te&draft_pos%5B%5D=e&draft_pos%5B%5D=t&draft_pos%5B%5D=g&draft_pos%5B%5D=c&draft_pos%5B%5D=ol&draft_pos%5B%5D=dt&draft_pos%5B%5D=de&draft_pos%5B%5D=dl&draft_pos%5B%5D=ilb&draft_pos%5B%5D=olb&draft_pos%5B%5D=lb&draft_pos%5B%5D=cb&draft_pos%5B%5D=s&draft_pos%5B%5D=db&draft_pos%5B%5D=k&draft_pos%5B%5D=p&c1stat=rush_att&c1comp=gt&c1val=150&c5val=1.0&order_by=rush_yds_per_att" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked second</a> among all backs who had at least 150 carries with an average of 5.1 yards per attempt. He finished strong, too, and there should be plenty of tread left on his soon-to-be 26-year-old tires because this was really his first season as a workhorse. </p><p>Drake averaged 5.2 yards per carry and scored eight touchdowns in eight games after a midseason trade from the Miami Dolphins. Like Henry, he turns 26 this month but has been gently used, so he should cash in.</p><p>Hyde and Gordon likely have less left in the tank but are quality veteran options, and the former certainly revived his career with a 1,000-yard season in Houston. And then there's McCoy, who keeps trucking as he approaches his 32nd birthday. The six-time Pro Bowler is no longer an offensive focal point, but he quietly averaged 4.6 yards per carry this year with the Chiefs. He might be worth a one-year flier. </p></ol></div><div class="organism contentStream slide" id="slide3"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-2868659-3" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="1" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_03" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div><h1>Wide Receiver</h1><div class="slideData">3 of 10</div><ol><div class="atom photo" itemscope="" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p></p><div class="imgWrapper"><img class="atom lazyImage lazy" itemProp="contentUrl" src="https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/slides/photos/004/372/426/640fd81d754a04f9795e5e02a5e0c555_crop_exact.jpg?h=53&amp;w=80&amp;q=70&amp;crop_x=center&amp;crop_y=top" width="800" height="533" alt="Cowboys receiver Amari Cooper"/></div><small><span class="caption">Cowboys receiver Amari Cooper</span><span itemProp="citation" class="credit">Stacy Revere/Getty Images</span></small></div><p><strong>1. Amari Cooper, Cowboys</strong></p><p><strong>2. Robby Anderson, New York Jets</strong></p><p><strong>3. Emmanuel Sanders, San Francisco 49ers</strong></p><p><strong>4. <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/aj-green">A.J.

They might not have the franchise tag for the 25-year-old, who is coming off a second consecutive 1,000-yard season and could fetch a contract worth as much as $20 million a year on the free-agent market. </p><p>There's a clear drop-off from Cooper to everyone else in the top tier at this position, but Anderson has the most upside after the 26-year-old put together a third consecutive season with at least 50 catches, 700 yards and five touchdowns in New York. Some team is going to convince itself it can take his game to the next level, and it'll spend a lot of money in that pursuit. That is, unless the Jets don't let him hit the market. </p><p>This group lacks depth, which is why the other three top potential targets are all beyond their prime.

Hunter Henry, Chargers</strong></p><p><strong>3. Eric Ebron, Indianapolis Colts</strong></p><p><strong>4. Tyler Eifert, Bengals </strong></p><p><strong>5. Jason Witten, Cowboys</strong></p><p>Hooper's a classic case of a free agent riding a promising trajectory, as his production has consistently risen throughout his four-year career in Atlanta. He peaked as a 25-year-old this season with 75 catches for 787 yards and six touchdowns (all career highs), and an argument can now be made that he's at least a top-10 tight end. He could easily become the first tight end to land a contract worth more than $10 million per year.</p><p>Every other tight end slated to hit the open market carries a lot more risk, starting with the injury-prone Henry, who has missed 20 games the last two seasons but has been extremely productive when healthy. He just turned 25 and should strike gold anyway, but some teams will want him to prove it, so he could end up taking a one-year deal. </p><p>Ebron, who was a top-10 pick in 2014, was essentially a bust with the Detroit Lions before exploding in a Pro Bowl 2018 campaign in Indy that included 13 touchdowns. But he couldn't stay healthy, and his production declined in his age-26 season.

The Titans declined his fifth-year option last offseason, and then he went out and put together a superb campaign. Bulaga is older and less durable, Beachum is older and less reliable, and Whitworth might be running on fumes at age 38. </span></p><p><span>We have seen more interior offensive linemen hit the market and break the bank in recent years, and both Scherff and Thuney are well-positioned to do so considering both are legitimate All-Pro candidates at guard.

Four premium pass-rushers were hit with the tag last offseason, and several will either re-sign or get slapped with the tag in February or March. </p><p>However, a Clowney tag doesn't appear to be on the table for Seattle. <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1168153526700335104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN's Adam Schefter</a> reported prior to the season that the Seahawks "promised" not to apply the tag to Clowney in 2020 (no word on if it was a pinkie swear), and a tag would be super expensive anyway since the three-time Pro Bowler was tagged by Houston last offseason. Still, it's doubtful they'd let the 26-year-old walk just six months after trading for him. </p><p>Barrett, however, is the most intriguing name on the list. He led the NFL with 19.5 sacks in an impressive season in Tampa Bay, and now he's on track to land a massive payday. That situation is further complicated by the fact the Buccaneers might decide to use the franchise tag on Winston. </p><p>And there'll likely be options beyond that. Ngakoue has registered at least eight sacks in all four of his NFL seasons. Dupree is coming off a breakout option year in which he compiled 11.5 sacks, and Fowler also had 11.5 sacks in his age-25 season with the Rams. Matt Judon of the Baltimore Ravens made the Pro Bowl with 9.5 sacks, and San Francisco's Arik Armstead finally broke through with a 10-sack season in 2019. </p><p>Look for at least a couple of those guys to become available. </p></ol></div><div class="organism contentStream slide" id="slide7"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-2868659-7" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="1" data-country="US" data-position="rect_atf_03" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div><h1>Interior Defensive Line</h1><div class="slideData">7 of 10</div><ol><div class="atom photo" itemscope="" itemType="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p></p><div class="imgWrapper"><img class="atom lazyImage lazy" itemProp="contentUrl" src="https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/slides/photos/004/372/430/075c8931051649b069abac11caa6037e_crop_exact.jpg?h=53&amp;w=80&amp;q=70&amp;crop_x=center&amp;crop_y=top" width="800" height="533" alt="Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones"/></div><small><span class="caption">Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones</span><span itemProp="citation" class="credit">Peter G.

It's ridiculous that he failed to make the Pro Bowl despite 15.5 sacks working primarily inside in 2018, but he finally broke through in another strong season as his rookie contract expired in 2019.

That's not a stock worthy of substantial investment at this point. </p><p>Fuller was one of the top slot corners in the league early in his career with the Washington Redskins, but he hasn't been able to replicate that since he was traded to the Chiefs in 2018. His timing also couldn't be worse, as he's coming off a walk year that was derailed by injury. </p><p>Waynes and Bradberry are both at least relatively young outside corners with extensive starting experience, but neither performed consistently well in 2019. </p><p>In other words, there isn't a single top-tier impending free-agent cornerback coming off a strong season.

He could have to sign a one-year prove-it deal somewhere, which isn't ideal considering he'll be 29 in July. </p><p>Meanwhile, McCourty is facing the biggest age-related question as he approaches 33.
