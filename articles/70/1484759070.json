Consequently, we have been doing our homework.\u201d\n\nCochrane stated that the PPS and Rider, with their lawyers, have had several \u201cfact-finding\u201d conversations over the past six months \u201cto gain a better sense of the legal issues relating to the property as well as the proposed move of the Choir College to Lawrenceville.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Choir College has been a great neighbor and partner to our schools for decades,\u201d Cochrane continued. \u201cWe often share facilities, and for years students from the Choir College taught music at our middle school. If the Choir College were to remain in Princeton, we would be delighted to continue that partnership.\u201d\n\nCochrane noted that Rider currently intends to keep a portion of the property and\n\nbuildings in Princeton for certain activities related to Westminster, including the Westminster Conservatory of Music, which educates more than 2,000 children and adults.\n\nCochrane went on to explain that PPS will be undergoing an extensive community-wide planning process over the next six months, considering multiple scenarios. \u201cWhat those scenarios will be, when the Board will decide, and the timeline for implementation of any single scenario is yet to be determined. As we move into community conversations about the future of our schools and of our town, the Westminster property, or some portion of it, will likely be discussed.\u201d\n\nPPS Planning\n\nEmphasizing that the planning process had no preconceived outcomes, would generate multiple possibilities, and would involve the whole community, Cochrane reviewed three stages to take place between now and June 2020 in collaboration with the planning firm Milone & MacBroom (M&M).\n\nIn the initial fact-finding stage, through January, M&M is reviewing enrollment projections, housing growth, the status of district facilities, building capacity, and educational programming.\n\nFrom the end of January through March, M&M will be developing various scenarios in collaboration with the Board, the community, and district professionals \u201cto generate a vision for our schools, to prioritize needs, and to review preliminary alternatives for achieving our goals,\u201d Cochrane said.\n\nFrom April to early June, the planners will narrow down the scenarios and provide a range of recommendations.\n\nCochrane pointed out that there are three elements involved in the critical process of ongoing community engagement and input.\n\nA technical advisory committee, a kind of steering committee comprised of district professionals and community experts, will help the consultants navigate the complexities of the planning process. Their first meeting with M&M will be on Friday, January 10.\n\nWith a goal of ensuring that all voices are heard \u2014 and that people are informed and engaged \u2014 a group of community liaisons will also be formed, representing a variety of stakeholders throughout the community.\n\nThe third element of community engagement will be a series of interactive workshops, informational meetings, surveys, and focus groups.\n\nThe first public forum will be held on Saturday, January 25, from 9 to 10:30 a.m., in the Princeton High School cafeteria. During that workshop, the M&M consultants will present their findings and impressions so far and engage the attendees to work together to establish goals and priorities.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.towntopics.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/1.gif", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "generator": "WordPress 5.1.4", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.towntopics.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-24-at-10.42.23-AM.png"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.towntopics.com/wordpress/2020/01/01/pps-plans-ahead-eyes-westminster-property/"}
