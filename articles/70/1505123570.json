He announced the launch of the beer online earlier this year along with other Nazi-related goods.\n\nThe beer is sold at 18.88 euros per crate. The number eighteen is often associated with Nazi Germany leader Adolf Hitler whose initials correspond to the first and the eighth letters of the alphabet.
