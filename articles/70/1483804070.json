It is not often that we see prizes that carry such a large cash award for poetry, to foster the development of new voices of young people emerging in poetry in Jamaica. We are encouraging everybody who is eligible\u2026 and persons interested in developing their voice and a career in poetry to get their submissions in,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Henry, who described the competition as an \u201cexcellent programme\u201d, contended that \u201cit is not just about the prizes\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is about being part of this network of young writers [for whom] we are putting together workshops and event activities geared towards developing their craft and poetic voices. We encourage everyone who is eligible to take advantage of this opportunity,\u201d she added.\n\nMs. Henry said since the competition\u2019s inception three years ago, there has been an emergence of new voices in poetry.\n\nIn a bid to further nurture these talents, she said poems that were shortlisted for prizes in the competition over the years will be published in an anthology by the administrator of the Poet Laureate of Jamaica programme, the NLJ.\n\nCopies of the publication will be distributed through the NLJ, and will be available at select bookstores.\n\nThe Poet Laureate of Jamaica Prizes for Poetry competition is a collaborative initiative of the NLJ, through the office of the Poet Laureate of Jamaica, and the United States-based University of Michigan Helen Zell Writers\u2019 Program.\n\nIt aims to recognise talented young Jamaicans who are interested in pursuing a career in poetry.\n\nPersons may contact the NLJ for submission criteria and other information at (876) 967-1526 or (876) 967-2516 or visit the website at www.nlj.gov.jm.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 19:55:31 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://jis.gov.jm/media/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Jamaica Information Service - The Voice of Jamaica", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "National Library Of Jamaica Extends Poetry Competition Submissions Deadline To Jan. 3, 2020 - Jamaica Information Service", "description": "Persons interested in participating in the National Library of Jamaica (NLJ) Poet Laureate of Jamaica Prizes for Poetry competition are invited to submit entries by ...
