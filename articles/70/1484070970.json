The church, looking upon baby Jesus, is called to continue it.\u201d\n\nThe church, like Mary, \u201cis woman and mother, and finds its distinctive traits in Our Lady,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sees her, the immaculate one, and says \u2018no\u2019 to sin and worldliness. It sees her, fruitful, and feels called to proclaim the Lord, to generate lives in him. It sees her, mother, and feels called to welcome every man and woman as a son or daughter.\u201d\n\nBy drawing closer to Mary, he said, the church will become more of what it is meant to be, more focused on Jesus and more united.\n\n\u201cThe enemy of human nature, the devil, seeks to divide it,\u201d the pope said. The devil entices people to put their \u201cdifferences, ideologies, thoughts of sides and parties\u201d first.\n\n\u201cStructures, programs and tendencies, ideologies and functions\u201d may tell people something about the church, he said, but those are not \u201cthe heart of the church, because the church has the heart of a mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe her children today invoke the Mother of God who unites us as a believing people,\u201d he said, praying: \u201cO Mother, generate in us hope, bring us unity. Woman of salvation, we entrust this year to you, watch over it in your heart.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["2020 World Peace Day", "Mary", "pope francis", "Solemnity of Mary the Mother of God", "violence against women", "world peace"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cindy Wooden", "Catholic News Service", "Posted January"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"keywords": "2020 World Peace Day, Mary, pope francis, Solemnity of Mary the Mother of God, violence against women, world peace", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "fb": {"pages": 108085326801}, "google-site-verification": "A8iklSxbt_qyO7YOXnA75o6KISmvf7AgYpV403xWCDI", "robots": "index,follow", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"title": "\u2018A victory for women is a victory for humanity,\u2019 pope says on Marian feast", "description": "The world will not know peace unless there is an end to violence against women, the exploitation of their bodies and the denial of their dignity, Pope Francis said on the Jan. 1 feast of Mary, Mother of God.", "type": "article", "url": "https://catholicphilly.com/2020/01/news/world-news/a-victory-for-women-is-a-victory-for-humanity-pope-says-on-marian-feast/", "site_name": "Catholic Philly", "image": "https://catholicphilly.com/media-files/2020/01/20200101T0843-0466-CNS-POPE-NEW-YEAR-796x568.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CatholicPhilly", "title": "\u2018A victory for women is a victory for humanity,\u2019 pope says on Marian feast", "description": "The world will not know peace unless there is an end to violence against women, the exploitation of their bodies and the denial of their dignity, Pope Francis said on the Jan. 1 feast of Mary, Mother of God.", "image": "https://catholicphilly.com/media-files/2020/01/20200101T0843-0466-CNS-POPE-NEW-YEAR-796x568.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://catholicphilly.com/media-files/2016/05/cropped-cplogo-fav-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://catholicphilly.com/2020/01/news/world-news/a-victory-for-women-is-a-victory-for-humanity-pope-says-on-marian-feast/"}
