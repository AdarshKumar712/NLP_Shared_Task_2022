He was eventually diagnosed with Cushing\u2019s disease; the excess production of his pituitary gland was caused by a tumour in his head.\n\n\"I was close to death,\" explained Woodhouse, who is now a Vancouver resident. \"I could hardly walk up the stairs.\"\n\nBut an exploratory procedure left him with a piece of a catheter in a blood vessel near his groin \u2013 and another full catheter was left behind during the surgery to remove the actual tumour.\n\nHis family doctor, Dr. Gregory Phillips, explained in a letter that the plastic catheter was left between two of his vertebrae, and \u201cis causing persistent symptoms and issues with pain, difficulty walking, an intermittent CSF leak which causes issues with sodium metabolism and further loss of function.\u201d\n\nAs Woodhouse grapples with headaches, back pain, fatigue and other issues from the devices left in his body, he said the surgeons involved have refused to acknowledge the problem. He said a complaint to the College of Physicians and Surgeons went nowhere, leaving him feeling like he has nowhere to turn.\n\n\u201cEveryone makes mistakes. I've made hundreds of mistakes,\" said Woodhouse. \u201cIf you're in my position, there's nowhere to go for help.\"\n\nOne of thousands\n\nThe discovery that health issues were caused by a misplaced medical device isn\u2019t unique, and it\u2019s actually becoming much more common than it used to be in Canada.\n\nIn November, a report released by the independent not-for-profit Canadian Institute for Health Information found that not only have such incidents spiked by 14 per cent since 2011, Canada has more than twice as many such incidents compared to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018, more than 550 objects were left behind in Canadian surgical patients.\n\nThe CIHI\u2019s director of emerging issues told CTV News while the data doesn\u2019t examine how or why these incidents happen, they are often smaller items like clips or sponges.\n\n\"Some surgeries are long and complicated and if they have to change people during that surgery because some surgeries last a long time, it may be that things get missed because of that,\u201d said Tracy Johnson.\n\n\u201cIt may be that they don't have protocols in place -- surgical checklists are one of the things that are utilized to try and prevent a number of things happening.\u201d\n\nWhat to do?\n\nWhen CTV News asked the provincial health ministry if there was any follow up or analysis to the November report, the government said local health authorities are responsible for oversight.\n\nVancouver Coastal Health directs complainants to its Patient Care Quality Office, which notes patients should address issues with the person who provided the service or their manager. Those who don\u2019t find a resolution there can submit a complaint through their website or by phone at 1-877-993-9199.\n\nIn November, Parksville mother Laura Jokinen told CTV News she lived with wires coming out of her body after an emergency C-section for 10 weeks before it was removed. It\u2019s been a year, and she says her health authority still hasn\u2019t taken responsibility.\n\n\u201cIf they aren't taking any accountability how are we going to make any positive changes to our health care system?\u201d she asked.\n\nWoodhouse wants acknowledgement of the mistakes made, without expectation of compensation or the need for a blame game \u2013 something he wants to see system-wide, in addition for his own personal circumstance.\n\n\u201cI need to stop this leak in my spine and that requires someone taking this piece of plastic out,\" he said, explaining that when he spoke with a lawyer, he was turned away when he told them, \u201cI don't want the money, I just want someone to help me.\u201d\n\nConsidering his spine is involved, Woodhouse says he\u2019s willing to sign any waivers a surgeon would require for the delicate work required to remove the material.\n\n\u201cWith my first operation death was on the table. [With] this one, I assume paralysis and death are probably on the table,\u201d said Woodhouse.\n\n\u201cSign me up.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Surrey", "Burnaby", "Metro Vancouver", "Fraser Valley", "North Shore", "Coquitlam", "Richmond", "Tri-Cities", "Delta", "Langley", "news", "Vancouver news", "CTV News", "CTV BC", "CTVBC", "BCTV news", "news Vancouver", "CTV Morning Live"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Penny Daflos"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 19:33:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Nick Woodhouse felt lucky to be alive after surviving a brain tumour, but a number of strange and painful symptoms emerged after his operation.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//static.ctvnews.ca/bellmedia/ctvnews/img/fav-icons-2019/57x57-CTVNews-Icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Nick Woodhouse felt lucky to be alive after surviving a brain tumour, but a number of strange and painful symptoms emerged after his operation.", "keywords": "Surrey, Burnaby, Metro Vancouver, Fraser Valley, North Shore, Coquitlam, Richmond, Tri-Cities, Delta, Langley, news, Vancouver news, CTV News, CTV BC, CTVBC, BCTV news, news Vancouver, CTV Morning Live", "news_keywords": "catheter, surgery, botched surgery, foreign object,", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "fb": {"pages": 174761742563060, "admins": "ctvbcnews"}, "dc.date.modified": "2019-12-31", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Catheter found in Vancouver man's spine years after operation", "description": "Nick Woodhouse felt lucky to be alive after surviving a brain tumour, but a number of strange and painful symptoms emerged after his operation.", "url": "https://bc.ctvnews.ca/catheter-found-in-vancouver-man-s-spine-years-after-operation-1.4749461", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4749467.1577849541!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg", "site_name": "British Columbia", "locale": "en_CA"}, "twitter": {"title": "Catheter found in Vancouver man's spine years after operation", "url": "https://bc.ctvnews.ca/catheter-found-in-vancouver-man-s-spine-years-after-operation-1.4749461", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Nick Woodhouse felt lucky to be alive after surviving a brain tumour, but a number of strange and painful symptoms emerged after his operation.", "site": "@CTVVancouver", "creator": "@CTVVancouver", "image": {"src": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4749467.1577849541!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg"}}, "author": "Penny Daflos", "article": {"author": "Penny Daflos", "published_time": "2019-12-31T19:33:00-08:00", "modified_time": "2019-12-31T19:56:00-08:00"}}, "canonical_link": "https://bc.ctvnews.ca/catheter-found-in-vancouver-man-s-spine-years-after-operation-1.4749461"}
