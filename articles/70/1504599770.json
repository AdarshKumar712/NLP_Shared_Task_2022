The resulting images appear similar to real photographs.\n\nASOS is the first retailer in Europe to trial the technology, and said See My Fit aims to 'help customers make more informed purchasing choices, by better showing how products look on models that more closely reflect individual customers'.\n\nThe tool was developed in partnership with Israeli AR company Zeekit that offers customers a simulated view of a product in different sizes and on different body types.\n\nSee My Fit follows a small earlier test by ASOS using Zeekit\u2019s technology in 2018, which automatically displayed products on up to four different models.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Jan 25 10:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "ANYONE who shops online regularly will know the feeling of trying something on for the first time and realising it looks nothing like it did on the\u2026", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/resources/images/1768508/", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "OMG-Verify-V1": "4389-366acdfc-5224-4c07-bb70-f74d8fbfc2db", "og": {"url": "https://www.thurrockgazette.co.uk/news/18179609.asos-see-fit-show-clothes-different-sized-models/", "site_name": "Thurrock Gazette", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thurrockgazette.co.uk/resources/images/10909312/", "width": 607, "height": 471}, "title": "Fashion site ASOS to show same clothes on different sized models", "type": "website", "name": "Fashion site ASOS to show same clothes on different sized models", "description": "ANYONE who shops online regularly will know the feeling of trying something on for the first time and realising it looks nothing like it did on the\u2026"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.thurrockgazette.co.uk/resources/images/10909312/"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Fashion site ASOS to show same clothes on different sized models", "description": "ANYONE who shops online regularly will know the feeling of trying something on for the first time and realising it looks nothing like it did on the\u2026"}, "fb": {"app_id": 184910691551371, "pages": 598730850174106}, "medium": "news", "title": "Fashion site ASOS to show same clothes on different sized models", "description": "ANYONE who shops online regularly will know the feeling of trying something on for the first time and realising it looks nothing like it did on the\u2026"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/18179609.asos-see-fit-show-clothes-different-sized-models/"}
