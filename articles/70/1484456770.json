The beginning of that change is already available in some dev builds of Chrome, if you\u2019re willing to put in some work.\n\nThe new design for Chrome has Google\u2019s Duet bar moved to the bottom of the screen, instead of at the top. This puts your controls at your fingertips, instead of forcing you to reach when you need to change tabs or anything.\n\nGoing past that, newer builds of Chrome use TabStrip, which shows your currently open tabs in a long stripe with favicons. If you\u2019re running a dev or canary build, though, you can merge the two features into a much more compact design. By enabling that integration, you simply long-press on the tabs buttons, and you\u2019ll have a floating strip of favicons showing your currently open tab. Don\u2019t even need to leave your browser page, and you can easily see everything you have open for multitasking.\n\nWell, except for one small problem. All of the icons are identical, so if you have multiple tabs open from the same site, it might get a little confusing remembering which is which. Could be a problem for things like Amazon where you might be price comparing, but you can still do a single press to get a full visual view of all your open tabs.\n\nThat\u2019s probably something that Google plans to polish up, though. This is only available in early builds, after all. Fingers crossed.\n\nsource: 9to5Google", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["mediatek", "accessories", "lenovo", "Wear OS", "Chromebook", "Oppo", "Android 12", "Google", "pixel 6", "Stadia", "Qualcomm", "Galaxy S22", "Chrome", "motorola"], "authors": ["Jared Peters"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Google recently rolled out tab groups to Chrome on Android, and the next step is to make switching tabs more fluent and mobile-first.
