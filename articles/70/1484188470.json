The \"Political Revolution\" is dedicated to reversing the ethical and moral downward spiral in the federal government today. Its ideals are to be rid of corruption in politics, to break up the big banks that control our economy for the 1%, to immediately start reversing climate change, and to regain focus on the well-being of our own citizens.\n\nProgressives can no longer afford to be scattered and disorganized. If the Political Revolution is to succeed, and if anything is going to get better, it must come through our political system. We need to unify with a truly Progressive leader. And in one voice we must join Bernie Sanders and shout together, \"Enough is enough!\" We need to shout it so loud that even the biased mainstream media cannot drown it out.\n\nTHE DECK IS STACKED AGAINST PROGRESSIVES\n\nToday's mainstream media is owned by only 6 corporate conglomerates. They are elite Establishment mechanisms whose mission is to maintain the status quo while protecting their own interests. They do NOT want Bernie Sanders and the Progressive Movement to succeed, and they're doing all they can to prevent that from happening. Toward that end, they are giving their attention to Establishment Democratic candidates while slighting Sanders.\n\nSo Progressives have their work cut out for them, and must pursue a different avenue to counter the mainstream media's biased reporting while educating voters.\n\nPROGRESSIVES MUST USE THEIR ENERGIES WISELY\n\nGrass roots mobilization and action are the keys to the success of the Political Revolution. But Progressives must focus their energies wisely to get the results necessary to start eliminating corruption in the federal government and to return it to the people that it serves.\n\nIt's time for Progressives to stop wasting our time trying to sway the 30% of voters who continue to support Trump. Instead we need to direct our energies toward those registered voters who did not vote in the 2016 elections. This is a huge voting bloc of people who either did not care, did not like the candidates or felt that their votes would not matter.\n\nTheir votes DO matter, and it's up to Progressives to target and educate them through an avenue besides the mainstream media. That avenue is social media.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: AN EFFECTIVE TOOL OF THE GRASS ROOTS PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT\n\nBernie Sanders faced a huge challenge when he ran for president in 2016. Though he did not win enough delegates to receive the Democratic nomination, given the circumstances, his campaign was phenomenally successful, in large part due to grass roots mobilization. Well aware of the mainstream media's bias against Sanders, Bernie's base used social media to spread the word about his platform, his political experience, and his sterling character with great success.\n\nNow that Bernie's running again in 2020, Progressives are getting another chance. And once again, Bernie is calling for our help.\n\nHERE'S HOW YOU CAN DO YOUR PART ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\n\u00b7 If you haven't already done this, set up accounts on face book, Twitter and Instagram;\n\n\u00b7 Share positive and informative Bernie Sanders and Progressive posts on your personal timeline;\n\n\u00b7 Tell your readers about Progressive candidates and how Bernie Sanders truly represents the interests of the American people;\n\n\u00b7 Explain how their votes can help oust the Oligarchs and Corporatists in the Senate and the House.\n\nIt's crucial that we educate and engage these non-voters in 2020\"the future of democracy in this country depends on it.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Government", "Political Activism", "Political Attacks", "Political Change", "Political Fence Sitters", "Political Revolution", "Political Values", "Politics", "President", "Progressives", "Voting"], "tags": ["Political Activism", "Government", "Voting", "Political Fence Sitters", "Political Change", "Political Attacks", "Political Revolution", "Progressives", "Political Values", "Politics", "President"], "authors": ["Ron Laguardia"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Article: The Political  Revolution And How You Can Participate - Progressives can no longer afford to be scattered and disorganized.
