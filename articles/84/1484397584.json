Picture: Toby Zerna\n\nTHE horror year for Southern Downs residents is being starkly shown as they finalise their dismal yearly rainfall totals for 2019.\n\nMegan Benz, who lives in Greymare, said she only recorded 125mm on her property this year.\n\nMrs Benz, who has been keeping records since 2009, said it was heartbreaking to record the meagre total.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting very hard from day to day now,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou can see how it\u2019s affecting my husband feeding the cattle, and every day it\u2019s just getting harder and harder.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a big bore here for 15 years and in the last few weeks, it\u2019s gone empty.\u201d\n\nGreymare received one of the lowest yearly rainfall totals in the Southern Downs, according to Mrs Benz.\n\n\u201cIt feels like living in a dome,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy in-laws are on the outskirts of Warwick and when they got the big downpour of 30mm a while ago, we got one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even enough to stop the dust.\u201d\n\nBefore December, Mrs Benz said the last decent rain arrived five months prior.\n\nLooking to 2020, the Greymare resident said they would need heavy rain early in the season to get back on their feet.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we need four inches a week for three months, just to get the feed grown for winter and if that rain is too late, we don\u2019t have any feed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need the rain and we need it earlier rather than later.\u201d\n\nBut as the drought carries on, it gets harder to see the light.\n\n\u201cThe longer it goes on the harder it is to be positive but you\u2019ve got to be,\u201d Mrs Benz said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens, you have to keep looking to the future.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Tessa Flemming"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Three months of rain needed in 2020, according to Southern Downs residents as they struggle to remain positive.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"description": "Three months of rain needed in 2020, according to Southern Downs residents as they struggle to remain positive.", "author": "Tessa Flemming", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"app_id": 135411266493476, "pages": 24945426253}, "og": {"site_name": "Warwick Daily News", "title": "LIVING IN A DOME: Residents recount their horror rainfall totals", "description": "Three months of rain needed in 2020, according to Southern Downs residents as they struggle to remain positive.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/01/02/v3imagesbin02917a78b942dd0af22220c35341f00e-ey3zqcsi9kkfcoaelt2_ct1880x930.jpg", "width": 1880, "height": 930}, "url": "https://www.warwickdailynews.com.au/news/living-in-a-dome-residents-recount-their-horror-ra/3913319/"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047077985, app-argument=warwickdailynews://article?aid=3913319&type=article", "al": {"ios": {"url": "warwickdailynews://article?aid=3913319&type=article", "app_store_id": 1047077985, "app_name": "Warwick Daily News"}, "android": {"url": "warwickdailynews://article?aid=3913319&type=article", "app_name": "Warwick Daily News", "package": "com.apnarm.warwickdailynews"}, "web": {"url": "https://www.warwickdailynews.com.au/news/living-in-a-dome-residents-recount-their-horror-ra/3913319/"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@warwick_daily", "title": "LIVING IN A DOME: Residents recount their horror rainfall totals", "description": "Three months of rain needed in 2020, according to Southern Downs residents as they struggle to remain positive.", "image": "https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/01/02/v3imagesbin02917a78b942dd0af22220c35341f00e-ey3zqcsi9kkfcoaelt2_ct300x300.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=1020", "capi-id": "3b62ba2a40ffc1ea9ca812a51ef44a0d", "article": {"content_tier": "locked"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.warwickdailynews.com.au/news/living-in-a-dome-residents-recount-their-horror-ra/3913319/"}
