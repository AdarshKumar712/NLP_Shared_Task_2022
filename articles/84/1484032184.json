Mark Nicdao\n\nMANILA -- It's a popular template for those posting online on how they plan to approach 2020 -- comparing their pictures from the start of the decade to ones taken just before the end of it.\n\nAnd Erwan Heussaff appeared to like the idea of looking back as he decided to use it to usher in the next chapter of his life as potential parents with wife, Kapamilya star Anne Curtis.\n\nOn New Year's Day, he shared a pair of photos -- one showing him carrying Curtis on his shoulders as they attended a music festival back in 2010, and another from a sexy pregnancy shoot.\n\n\"Started the decade partying it up at a music festival, ended it counting it down, just the two of us with virgin cocktails and starting the new one with another girl to carry on my shoulders,\" he wrote, referring to Curtis' pregnancy.\n\nCurtis first announced that she was expecting back in November, and she's expected to give birth sometime in March.\n\nShe is also looking forward to life as a mother, flaunting her growing baby bump with her husband. The set also sees them both topless, with only Curtis' arms hiding her chest.\n\n\"2020 is going to be the best chapter of our love story Mon amour. I just know it. ...P.S - yes, this includes; Dirty diapers, late nights, loud crying, hiccups, little giggles and little kisses.. EVERYTHING. We got this,\" she wrote, unedited, as the caption.\n\nThe black-and-white photos were taken by celebrity photographer Mark Nicdao.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Anne Curtis", "Erwan Heussaff", "LOOK: Anne Curtis proudly shows off baby bump in stunning photoshoot | ABS-CBN News"], "tags": ["Erwan Heussaff", "Anne Curtis"], "authors": ["Abs-Cbn News"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "'2020 is going to be the best chapter of our love story,' Anne Curtis tells husband Erwan Heussaff as she shows off her baby bump in a fun photoshoot.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/abs-cbnnews/abscbnmaster/newsapple-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "keywords": "Anne Curtis, Erwan Heussaff, LOOK: Anne Curtis proudly shows off baby bump in stunning photoshoot | ABS-CBN News", "description": "'2020 is going to be the best chapter of our love story,' Anne Curtis tells husband Erwan Heussaff as she shows off her baby bump in a fun photoshoot.", "copyright": "All rights reserved by ABS-CBN Corporation", "news_keywords": "Anne Curtis, Erwan Heussaff, LOOK: Anne Curtis proudly shows off baby bump in stunning photoshoot | ABS-CBN News", "articleID": 624523, "article-tags": "Anne Curtis, Erwan Heussaff", "section": "Entertainment", "thumbnail": "https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2020/entertainment/01/01/20200101-anne-thumb.jpg", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "category": "Entertainment", "pubdate": "2020-01-01T08:53:18", "lastmod": "2020-01-01T09:48:53", "medium": "article", "og": {"title": "LOOK: Anne Curtis proudly shows off baby bump in stunning photoshoot", "description": "'2020 is going to be the best chapter of our love story,' Anne Curtis tells husband Erwan Heussaff as she shows off her baby bump in a fun photoshoot.", "url": "https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/01/20/look-anne-curtis-proudly-shows-off-baby-bump-in-stunning-photoshoot", "image": {"identifier": "https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2020/entertainment/01/01/20200101-anne-thumb.jpg", "alt": "LOOK: Anne Curtis proudly shows off baby bump in stunning photoshoot"}, "type": "article", "site_name": "ABS-CBN News", "locale": {"identifier": "en_US", "alternate": "tl_PH"}}, "article": {"section": "Entertainment", "tag": "Anne Curtis, Erwan Heussaff, Entertainment, 2020-01-01", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/abscbnNEWS"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1710456575844989, "pages": 27254475167}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABSCBNNews", "url": "https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/01/20/look-anne-curtis-proudly-shows-off-baby-bump-in-stunning-photoshoot", "title": "LOOK: Anne Curtis proudly shows off baby bump in stunning photoshoot", "description": "'2020 is going to be the best chapter of our love story,' Anne Curtis tells husband Erwan Heussaff as she shows off her baby bump in a fun photoshoot.", "image": "https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2020/entertainment/01/01/20200101-anne-thumb.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/abs-cbnnews/abscbnmaster/favicon.ico"}, "canonical_link": "https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/01/20/look-anne-curtis-proudly-shows-off-baby-bump-in-stunning-photoshoot"}
