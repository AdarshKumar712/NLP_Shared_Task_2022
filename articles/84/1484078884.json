The Aztecs lost the first two sets of the Division 2 final, and had lost the second set by a larger margin than the first. Owens managed to rally the team, and the team rallied to win three sets in a row to capture Esperanza\u2019s third CIF-SS girls volleyball title.\n\nOwens, 49, has coached at Esperanza since 2001. He has coached the boys and girls teams there during his tenure, and since 2014 has exclusively been the girls coach.\n\nOwens played his high school volleyball at Huntington Beach.\n\nEsperanza had excellent players this season.\n\n\u201cElyse Stowell was amazing,\u201d said Owens of the junior outside hitter who was the CIF-SS Division 2 player of the year. \u201c(Senior setter) Maddy Harkey did a wonderful job for us, (outside hitter) Julia Waugh was outstanding as a freshman with her ability to pass and hit, and our junior middle Taylor Jones was great, too.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["All-County teams"], "authors": ["Steve Fryer", "Steve Fryer Covers High School Sports At The Orange County Register.
