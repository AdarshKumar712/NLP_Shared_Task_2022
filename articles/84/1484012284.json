Bukola Sarski as the President of 8th Senate, however, maintained that God\u2019s design for a better and prosperous Nigeria could only manifest with the support and prayers of both the leaders and the led.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s favour dwells in an atmosphere of unity, tolerance, peaceful co-existence, so achieving the desired developed economy requires a collective responsibility of stakeholders to succeed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe man of God also urged the citizens to pray against the incidence of fire outbreaks, road accidents and air mishaps in the new year.\n\nHe charged the youth to shun anti-social vices and be more prepared, morally, spiritually and academically in taking up the mantle of leadership in the nearest future.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Kwara", "New Year", "cleric"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 15:11:06 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Prophet Christopher Owolabi has charged leadership of the ruling APC to engage in fervent prayer to avoid break-up ahead of 2023", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/logo.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Prophet Christopher Owolabi has charged leadership of the ruling APC to engage in fervent prayer to avoid break-up ahead of 2023", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Cleric tasks APC leaders to pray against party break-up ahead of 2023 elections", "description": "Prophet Christopher Owolabi has charged leadership of the ruling APC to engage in fervent prayer to avoid break-up ahead of 2023", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/cleric-tasks-apc-leaders-to-pray-against-party-break-up-ahead-of-2023-elections/", "site_name": "Tribune Online", "image": {"identifier": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/APC.jpg", "secure_url": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/APC.jpg", "width": 450, "height": 350}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Tribuneonline/", "tag": "New Year", "section": "Latest News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T15:11:06+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1050738235033475, "pages": 77912203638}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Prophet Christopher Owolabi has charged leadership of the ruling APC to engage in fervent prayer to avoid break-up ahead of 2023", "title": "Cleric tasks APC leaders to pray against party break-up ahead of 2023 elections", "site": "@nigeriantribune", "image": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/APC.jpg", "creator": "@nigeriantribune"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/cleric-tasks-apc-leaders-to-pray-against-party-break-up-ahead-of-2023-elections/?ia_markup=1"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/logo.jpg", "numberOfItems": 3, "itemListOrder": "Ascending"}, "canonical_link": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/cleric-tasks-apc-leaders-to-pray-against-party-break-up-ahead-of-2023-elections/"}
