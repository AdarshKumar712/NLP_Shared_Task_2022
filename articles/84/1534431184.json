(File) Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram (L) and Kanhaiya Kumar. (File)\n\nSenior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram Saturday criticised the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government for giving the go-ahead to prosecute former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar and nine others in the 2016 JNU sedition case. He said he \u201cstrongly disapproved\u201d the decision.\n\n\u201cDelhi government is no less ill-informed than the central government in its understanding of sedition law. I strongly disapprove of the sanction granted to prosecute Mr Kanhaiya Kumar and others for alleged offences under sections 124A and 120B of IPC,\u201d Chidambaram tweeted.\n\nOn Friday, seven months after its standing counsel advised against prosecution sanction to Delhi Police in the case, the AAP government gave the nod to Delhi Police to Prosecute Kumar.\n\nDelhi Government is no less ill-informed than the central government in its understanding of sedition law. I strongly disapprove of the sanction granted to prosecute Mr Kanhaiya Kumar and others for alleged offences under sections 124A and 120B of IPC. \u2014 P. Chidambaram (@PChidambaram_IN) February 29, 2020\n\nIn its chargesheet, the police has claimed that Kumar led a procession and supported \u2014 along with others named as accused \u2014 seditious slogans raised on the JNU campus on February 9, 2016 during an event to mark the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru.\n\nReacting to the move, Kanhaiya Kumar urged government officials and the police to ensure a speedy trial in a fast track court. \u201cThere is a need for fast track courts and speedy action in the sedition so that the country can know how the sedition law has been misused in this entire case for political gains and to divert people from their basic issues,\u201d he said in a tweet.\n\nThe wait for prosecution sanction had been a constant irritant in the already strained ties between the AAP government in Delhi and the Centre. Police claimed the trial was stalled for want of sanction and several BJP leaders accused AAP of shielding the students by not giving the go-ahead.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
