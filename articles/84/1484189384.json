He died Dec. 30 at age 94. (CNS/Paul Haring)\n\nVatican City \u2014 Maltese Cardinal Prosper Grech, an Augustinian priest and expert on the fathers of the early church, died Dec. 30 at the Santo Spirito Hospital near the Vatican. He was 94.\n\nIn a message of condolence to the prior general of the Augustinians, Pope Francis said he always had \"great esteem\" for the cardinal, \"both because of his personal witness of Christian and consecrated life, as well as for his exemplary service to the formation of new generations, especially of priests.\"\n\nGrech's funeral was scheduled for Jan. 2 in St. Peter's Basilica with Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, vice dean of the College of Cardinals, presiding. Francis was scheduled to lead the rite of final commendation at the end of the funeral Mass.\n\nThe cardinal was a \"wise and compassionate religious\" with a \"great sense of humor and humanity,\" said a statement released Dec. 30 by the bishops of Malta: Archbishop Charles Scicluna, Auxiliary Bishop Joseph Galea-Curmi and Bishop Mario Grech, apostolic administrator of Gozo.\n\nAlthough he already was over 80 and therefore ineligible to vote in the conclave to elect a successor to Pope Benedict XVI in March 2013, the cardinals chose him to give the first meditation inside the Sistine Chapel when they gathered for the election.\n\nFive months later, the Vatican newspaper published the text of Grech's talk, which included reminders of the importance of presenting the Catholic faith in its entirety, the need to recognize the errors of church members and the need for unity within the Catholic community.\n\nThe church is called to proclaim the kingdom of God and the good news of salvation through Christ, he told his fellow cardinals. \"The church does this presenting the Gospel without shortcuts, without diluting the word.\"\n\nListing threats to the Catholic Church, the cardinal first cited a general lack of understanding of church teaching. But he also saw a gathering storm of threats to the church's unity. \"Between ultra-traditionalist extremists and ultra-progressive extremists, between priests rebelling against obedience and those who don't recognize the signs of the times, there always will be the risk of small schisms that not only damage the church, but go against the will of God,\" he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Dec", "Jun", "Jul", "Oct", "Jan", "Aug"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 12:14:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Maltese Cardinal Prosper Grech, an Augustinian priest and expert on the fathers of the early church, died Dec. 30 at the Santo Spirito Hospital near the Vatican.
