The stock has rallied over 20% in the last one month itself.\n\nGlobal research firm Citi has a positive stance on the recovery of Tata Motors\u2019 UK-based subsidiary JLR even as domestic sales and demand scenario remains muted.\n\nCiti expects JLR to see strong margin improvement along with better volume cadence. For the domestic business, Citi is of the view that the commercial vehicle industry in India is unlikely to recover very fast, but Tata Motors should maintain its dominance in the segment. The passenger vehicle portfolio is improving but competition is escalating as well, it added.\n\nOn Wednesdsay, Tata Motors reported a 12% decline in total vehicle sales in the domestic market to 44,254 units in December compared with 50,440 units in the same month in 2018. Of this, total passenger vehicle sales stood at 12,785 units, down 10% from 14,260 units in December 2018.\n\nTata Motors president (passenger vehicles business unit) Mayank Pareek said: \u201cOur focus in December has been to drive retail and minimise the network stock in order to facilitate a smooth transition to BS-VI.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHaving almost completed our planned production and despatches of BS-IV, we will start moving to BS-VI production and despatches from January and step up our volumes in the coming months.\u201d\n\nGet the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.
