According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), there would be \u201cno cold wave in the city till January 4 (Saturday) and temperatures will rise further\u201d. The department also predicted moderate fog on Wednesday and very light rain on Thursday.\n\nThe prolonged cold wave and absence of adequate sunshine due to a dense fog had caused the mercury to plummet drastically. December recorded an 18-day \u2018cold spell\u2019, the maximum after December 1997.IMD Senior scientist Kuldeep Srivastava, said strong easterly winds prevented the formation of dense fog on Tuesday morning and hence maximum temperature rose significantly.\n\nThe minimum temperature also went up from 2.8 degrees Celsius on Monday to 4.7 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. The maximum temperature also rose to 14.6 degrees Celsius.The minimum temperature at Palam was recorded at 4.1 degrees Celsius and Lodhi Road at 3.7 degrees Celsius. Mercury fell to 4.2 degrees Celsius in Aya Nagar.\n\nThe IMD also said that this is also the longest duration of severe cold day since 1992 \u201cfor the three months, December to February in totality\u201d. Mahesh Palawat, a senior scientist at private forecasting agency Skymet Weather, said the \u201cworst period\u201d was over for now and icy winds won\u2019t continue from northwest for long.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["India Matters"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Easterly winds sweep away layer of dense fog; light rain expected in the city on Thursday", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://images.newindianexpress.com/images/FrontEnd/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Cold wave abates as mercury rises", "description": "Easterly winds sweep away layer of dense fog; light rain expected in the city on Thursday", "msvalidate.01": "E3846DEF0DE4D18E294A6521B2CEBBD2", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"pages": 178988994793}, "og": {"url": "https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2020/jan/01/cold-wave-abates-as-mercury-rises-2083488.html", "type": "article", "title": "Cold wave abates as mercury rises", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/1/1/w600X390/Cold_wave_abates_as.jpg", "width": 450, "height": 298}, "site_name": "The New Indian Express", "description": "Easterly winds sweep away layer of dense fog; light rain expected in the city on Thursday"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "NewIndianXpress", "site": "@newindianexpress.com", "title": "Cold wave abates as mercury rises", "description": "Easterly winds sweep away layer of dense fog; light rain expected in the city on Thursday", "image": "https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/1/1/w600X390/Cold_wave_abates_as.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2020/jan/01/cold-wave-abates-as-mercury-rises-2083488.html"}
