Cuban leader Ra\u00fal Castro and his children were sanctioned, along with other officials and companies, especially those involved in shipments of Venezuelan oil that keep the island afloat.\n\nKozak said the U.S. would push to squeeze further activities that bring revenue to the government, including the medical services export program that brought more than $6 billion to the Cuban government in 2018.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the airlines, we have significantly restricted the schedule of the flights there and, again, we continue to look at other ways to tighten up the sources of revenue,\u201d the official added.\n\nTrump critics have questioned the effectiveness of the current policy toward Cuba. Although the Cuban government has acknowledged that U.S. sanctions are hitting the economy hard, it has not shown signs of abandoning Maduro. Instead, Cuban officials have suggested that the Trump administration intends to damage diplomatic relations and close the two countries\u2019 embassies, reopened under Barack Obama in 2015.\n\nGranma, Cuba\u2019s Communist Party newspaper, accused the U.S. charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Havana, Mara Tekach, of intervening in the internal affairs of the country. Cuba\u2019s appointed-president, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, said in a recent speech that his government would respond to Washington\u2019s alleged meddling.\n\nKozak, a career diplomat who was in charge of the Interests Section in Havana between 1996-99, declined to comment on the possibility of a breakdown in diplomatic relations and defended Tekach\u2019s work \u201cin defense of human rights and democracy\u201d in Cuba.\n\n\u201cU-S. Cuba relations had not been good since this regime took power 61 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are back again as they were, in the early days of the revolution, trying to prop up similar dictatorships around the world, especially in Venezuela, where you see Maduro guarded by Cuban bodyguards because he cannot trust his own people, and military Intelligence penetrated by hundreds and hundreds of Cuban officers.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalking about intervening in somebody else\u2019s internal affairs, I think that\u2019s a pretty good example of it,\u201d he added.\n\nNo changes in immigration policies for Cubans\n\nThe embassy in Havana is currently operating with a minimum staff after the closing of its consular office in September 2017 in response to health incidents that affected 26 U.S. officials and their families and whose cause is still unknown, Kozak said.\n\nThe suspension of the issuance of visas in Havana and the restrictive immigration policies of the Trump administration have made it much more difficult for Cubans to travel or obtain asylum in the United States. That situation is likely to continue next year.\n\nKozak declined to comment on a bill introduced by Florida Democratic representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell to reopen the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program that has been suspended for more than two years, leaving more than 20,000 Cubans in limbo. The bill proposes to conduct visa interviews via teleconference.\n\n\u201cCubans are still eligible to come to the United States under the same laws that apply to every other country in the world,\u201d Kozak said. \u201cYes, it\u2019s more difficult now because we\u2019ve had to reduce our consular staff so radically.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump\u2019s foreign policy towards Latin America has denounced dictatorships in the region, those fleeing from those governments find significant obstacles in obtaining asylum in the U.S.\n\nCuban asylum seekers, like citizens of any other country, must now wait in Mexico to resolve their cases. Many who applied before the new policy came into force in May have been waiting for months in detention centers across the country. And the administration is finalizing agreements with several Central American countries for them to take the burden of immigrants, including Cubans, who cross their territories in their route to the Mexican border.\n\n\u201cOur asylum system has gotten completely overwhelmed, so we\u2019ve taken these steps,\u201d Kozak said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean people will get sent back to the place they\u2019re going to be persecuted. They have to wait somewhere else while they get processed. In that respect, Cubans are being treated the same as [people from] all other countries.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Cubans must travel to a third country to obtain U.S. visas, after the withdrawal of most diplomatic personnel in Havana due to several cases of U.S. officials affected with brain injuries and other symptoms. The incidents caused a blow to U.S.-Cuba relations, and several U.S. government officials described them as \u201cattacks\u201d targeting their personnel in Havana.\n\nBut Kozak refused to use that term to refer to what happened in Havana.\n\n\u201cPeople suffered physical damage to their bodies. We don\u2019t know how that was done, or by whom, so we\u2019re not going to speculate,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cWhat we know is that they were injured, and we haven\u2019t gotten cooperation from the Cuban side.\u201d\n\n-- By Nora G\u00e1mez Torres", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "\u201cStay tuned, there will be more actions aimed at restricting their sources of income,\u201d said Michael Kozak, acting assistant secretary of state for Latin America.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/pf/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "\u201cStay tuned, there will be more actions aimed at restricting their sources of income,\u201d said Michael Kozak, acting assistant secretary of state for Latin America.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cuba under \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 by Trump in 2020", "site": "TB_Times", "url": "https://tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2019/12/31/cuba-under-maximum-pressure-by-trump-in-2020/", "image": "https://www.tampabay.com/resizer/2zHoNSvDIXaTX-dCuH_nujjTlUc=/800x450/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tbt.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZQM46MWISYI6TIRQPAY4DVT77I.jpg"}, "og": {"image": "https://www.tampabay.com/resizer/2zHoNSvDIXaTX-dCuH_nujjTlUc=/800x450/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tbt.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZQM46MWISYI6TIRQPAY4DVT77I.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Cuba under \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 by Trump in 2020", "site_name": "Tampa Bay Times", "url": "https://tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2019/12/31/cuba-under-maximum-pressure-by-trump-in-2020/", "description": "\u201cStay tuned, there will be more actions aimed at restricting their sources of income,\u201d said Michael Kozak, acting assistant secretary of state for Latin America."}, "pageType": "article", "title": "Cuba under \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 by Trump in 2020", "campaignData": "Politics:Buzzblog", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "Florida's favorite paper, Tampa Bay's favorite local news site", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/pf/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/pf/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/pf/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/pf/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/pf/mstile-310x310.png", "fb": {"app_id": 117591765631093, "pages": 9924394837}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2019/12/31/cuba-under-maximum-pressure-by-trump-in-2020/"}
