Pope!\u201d from pilgrims gathered to catch a glimpse of him. The head of the Catholic Church greeted admirers on his way to see the Nativity scene set up in the esplanade at the center of Vatican City\n\nHe took the time to bless children along the route which had him separated from the throngs by fencing, shaking hands and smiling just before he pivoted to move away.\n\nJust before he walked away, a woman along the fence could be seen making the sign of the cross. She reached out to touch his hand as many others had been doing, but she did not let go as the pontiff walked away. She forcefully tugged at his hand to pull him back toward her, a move that appeared to cause him pain and visibly angered him.\n\nThe pope wrenched his hand free and seemed to scold the woman, who was trying to say something to him. Though it was not clear what she said, it was more than obvious that Pope Francis was annoyed, as his face clearly showed when he turned to walk away after slapping the woman\u2019s hand away and admonishing her.\n\nThe sovereign of the Vatican City State and the first non-European leader of the Catholic church in over 1,000 years, Pope Francis led a New Year\u2019s Eve Vespers service in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica on Tuesday where he encouraged people to \u201cbuild bridges, not walls.\u201d\n\nThe religious leader, who was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, has raised eyebrows with his many progressive views and decisions since being elected the 266th pope of the Roman Catholic Church in March 2013, replacing his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nThe relationship between the two religious leaders and Bergoglio\u2019s rise to the papacy is portrayed in the new Netflix film \u201cThe Two Popes,\u201d in which actor Jonathan Pryce plays the part of Pope Francis.\n\nTuesday\u2019s incident in the crowd was widely discussed on social media as many defended the Pope for his irritation at being forcefully pulled.\n\nShe was out of line and being disrespectful. No one should think it\u2019s ok to grab other people with no consequence. \u2014 WillPaintForFood (@ClevrGerl) January 1, 2020\n\nShe was very rude and he did what he has to do. \u2014 Sally (@Sally86Li) January 1, 2020\n\nI don\u2019t think he done a thing wrong. Security was awful but in his position we\u2019d all react like that \u2014 Ste Mccoy (@lpool39) January 1, 2020\n\nEven Popes get angry \u2014 Boitumelo Matsho (@Boitumelo_M68) January 1, 2020\n\nYou can see that the Pope was hurt. He is already old and almost lost his balance. Even the person beside her was shock because of what she did. \u2014 That\u2019s Okay, X(\uc774\uc720)Soo\u2764\ufe0fWhat A Life w/ City Lights\u2728 (@xiumin2326) January 1, 2020\n\nHe shakes, quite literally, thousands of hands in any given day or week and Pope John Paul II was actually shot. I think he was just being proactive in taking care of himself. Also, as someone else pointed out, she could have been holding his hand tight enough to hurt. \u2014 Linda Armstrong (@LindaSalem) January 1, 2020\n\nOthers admonished the religious leader who, ironically, spoke about making \u201ctime for others\u201d during the New Year\u2019s Eve service.\n\nDid Pope Francis have time for this obviously desperate women? Did he dialogue with her? How did he recognize her attempts to speak to him? With two slaps and name calling \u201cBruja! https://t.co/CvMosPJnTB \u2014 Leticia Velasquez (@CauseofourJoy) December 31, 2019\n\nI\u2019m agree.\n\nBut maybe ask her what she needed? \u2014 DeboraS (@DeboraS91563560) January 1, 2020\n\nMiscommunication. He should have listened to her. \u2014 Stephen (@Wreinhardt_) January 1, 2020\n\nShe was trying to tell him something. What was it? \u2014 Charles Stuart (@Charles94070343) January 1, 2020\n\nHas Christ slapped a desperate woman? Not once \u2014 Semos (@RicketyJohnson) January 1, 2020\n\nI am not sure how I want to feel about this. I know that a woman grab the robe of Jesus and we wasn\u2019t mad about it. When I see this I think okay so are you the pope or a person? Odd attitude seeing that this pope said make bridges and not walls. \u2014 Amused But Not (@amusedbutnot) January 1, 2020", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Frieda Powers", "Michelle Malkin", "Dennis Prager", "Stephen Moore", "Tucker Carlson", "Neil Patel", "Terence Jeffrey", "Chuck Norris", "John R.
