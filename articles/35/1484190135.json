He had his first 100-yard game against USC with five catches for 141 yards. Asiasi finished the year ranked second on the team with an average of 53.42 receiving yards per game.\n\nAsiasi finishes his UCLA career with 771 receiving yards and five touchdowns in 21 games as a Bruin.\n\nThe 2020 NFL draft is April 23-25.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["ucla-football"], "authors": ["Maggie Vanoni", "Maggie Vanoni Covers All Things Ucla Athletics For The Southern California News Group.
