At least two people were killed as the eastern parts of Australia\u2019s two most populous states continued to get torched.\n\nThe weather forecast offers only a little respite from the conditions that have fueled a surge in blazes amid what has been the country\u2019s worst fire season in memory.\n\nAccording to AccuWeather, there will be a letup Thursday in the heat and gusty winds that caused the fires to spread across New South Wales and Victoria, but those same factors will return Friday and into Saturday. It\u2019s not until Sunday that widespread rain will arrive in the area for the first time in several weeks.\n\nTragic:Thousands of koalas feared dead as wildfires ravage Australia\n\nNew South Wales state Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons wasn't overly optimistic.\n\n\u201cWhat we really need is meaningful rain,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cand we haven\u2019t got anything in the forecast at the moment that says we\u2019re going to get drought-breaking or fire-quenching rainfall.\u201d\n\nThe tinder-dry conditions prompted the cancellation of fireworks shows across the nation, and Sydney Mayor Clover Moore was pressed to follow suit as the leader of the largest city in a state, New South Wales, where almost 100 fires are burning. In the town of Conjola Park alone, 50 properties were confirmed destroyed and cars were melted by Tuesday\u2019s blazes.\n\nMoore declined, saying the New Year\u2019s Eve celebration would \u201cgive hope to people at a terrible time.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe also pointed out the event had been months in the making and generates more than $90 million in revenue, drawing visitors from near and far. Sydney was granted an exemption to a total fireworks ban in place there and elsewhere to prevent new wildfires.\n\nThe Australian tourism industry may take a hit nonetheless after an estimated 4,000 people had to seek refuge on a beach in the southeastern town of Mallacoota, Victoria, about 300 miles east of Melbourne, as winds pushed a wildfire toward houses. The smoke-filled sky shrouded the town in darkness before turning a shade of bright red.\n\nMany people escaped on boats as crews battled the blaze, eventually getting a break when the winds changed direction late in the day, though by then dozens of homes had burned.\n\nWATCH:Incredible footage of Australia wildfires shows danger firefighters face\n\nStranded residents and vacationers slept in cars, while gas stations and surf clubs transformed into evacuation areas.\n\nVictoria Emergency Commissioner Andrew Crisp told reporters the Australian Defense Force was moving naval assets to Mallacoota on a supply mission that would last two weeks and helicopters would also fly in more firefighters because roads were inaccessible.\n\nThere were grave fears for four missing people. \u201cWe can\u2019t confirm their whereabouts,\u201d Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters.\n\nAustralia\u2019s fire season, which began earlier than usual after an uncommonly dry and warm winter, has already claimed 13 lives and resulted in more than 1,000 homes being destroyed.\n\nIn the nation's capital of Canberra, smoke from the wildfires led to the worst air quality in the world Wednesday, with a rating more than 21 times above the hazardous level.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Australia's fires continue to rage, sending 4,000 people in a beach town scrambling for refuge, and the weather forecast offers only brief relief.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Australia bushfires have scorched 12M acres and killed at least 2 people.
