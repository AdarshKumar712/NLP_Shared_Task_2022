The shark can be seen floating in vertical position as the aquatic animal and diver slowly turns towards the onlookers. It can also be seen that a multitude of exotic fish are swimming around them as they dance.\n\nAs per a report published in Daily Mail, the footage was recorded on October 27, 2019.\n\nApparently, the oceanarium houses 41 aquariums, which are a home to around 150 species of fish, sea mammals and other marine life, including 4,500 exotic and tropical fish.\n\nThe report also said that regular shows in the oceanarium include 'Feeding The Seals' and 'The Shark Show.\u2019\n\nThe video, which has been shared by a YouTube channel called the \u2018Viral Hog,\u2019 has received varied comments. While some users have lauded the diver, others have hit out at the administration of the oceanarium for using the animal for their profit.\n\nA user whose name is written in Chinese commented, \u201cCorrect me if I'm wrong, I'm not a zoologist, but I've heard sharks need to keep moving forward in order for water to keep passing through their gills so they'll be able to breath. Isn't the position that the shark is in dangerous for it\u2019s health?\u201d\n\nAnother user, who goes by the name LouisianaGatorGirl stated, \u201cThe sharks that I\u2019ve seen captive in aquariums look severely depressed\u2014not moving, just waiting to die\u2014like this poor shark. For an aquarium to abuse a shark for profit like this is extremely disturbing.\u201d\n\nGet the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.
