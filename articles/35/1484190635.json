It will be another year where gasoline prices will be relatively affordable \u2014 but don\u2019t close your eyes \u2014 the price variation between stations and states will approach record levels,\u201d advises Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy .\n\nFor those making resolutions, GasBuddy suggests shopping around at the pump and driving less aggressively: The savings could add up to $477 per year, or roughly $10 per tank. In addition, motorists can sign up for Pay with GasBuddy, a free program that links to your checking account and offers instant savings of up to 25 cents per gallon\n\nFind the full report linked here.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Business Journal, Youngstown, Ohio.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 14:56:34 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://businessjournaldaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cropped-Business-journal-bug-web-32x32.jpg", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "kz3Zo92YHkr1vfNcFfdexeJ0UVZTlccqvQEuZDJe9rw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "2020 to Bring Good News at Gas Pump for Some, Not All - Business Journal Daily", "description": "BOSTON\u00a0\u2013 GasBuddy, the smartphone app helping consumers avoid paying full price for fuel, today predicts that 2020 will feature a yearly national average of $2.60 per gallon, representing a 2 cent drop versus 2019.
