Our thoughts and condolences are with the families of those affected by this very sad incident.\"\n\nA local driver, who did not want to be named, said the crash scene looked \"bad\".\n\nHe described it as \"a bad road\" that needs widening, adding: \"You would be amazed how many accidents have happened down that road.\"\n\nThe road was closed on Wednesday morning while the lorry was recovered.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["British Airways", "New Year's Eve", "UK", "News"], "tags": ["British Airways", "News", "New Year's Eve", "Festival news", "Best films", "TV reviews", "Pop up", "Secret London"], "authors": ["Luke O'Reilly"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 21:08:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A \u00a330,000 goal has been reached on a charity page, dubbed the \"BA Angels Fund\", after three cabin crew members were killed in a New Year's Eve crash near Heathrow Airport.
