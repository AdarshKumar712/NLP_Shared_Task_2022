Telekinesis is the ability to move objects through mind power. Teleportation refers to transporting yourself or your mind to a location miles away from you in fraction of seconds.\n\nIf you have read the recent article headlined at OpEdNews, Hunter and My Hippocampus: The Real \"House Hunters\", about Hunter taking me to the address where my girlfriend lived in 1970, then scroll down to The 3 Tele's Hypothesis: Schuylkill Drive is a Trap Street.\n\nLong-term memory is divided into two types: declarative (explicit) memory and non-declarative (implicit) memory.\n\nExplicit memories include all of the Memories that are available in Consciousness [1]\n\nThe night I brought Hunter home and parked three houses away, he found the house. Thirteen days later I took him to Hidden Hills where my cousin lives and parked over a mile away. I have never walked, hiked or done anything on foot in Hidden Hills.\n\nIf you have a of lot time on your hands, then you can watch the 9-minute video. The thumbnail on the YouTube video is the map of the route he took to get to their house. I also made a 5-minute version where you can watch Hunter find the house and run up the driveway into the garage to the back door.\n\nWhy is that important? He is off-leash and everyone who visits enters the house through the garage.\n\nEither video will convince you that he isn't \"finding\" by scent, nor am I giving him non-verbal clues. We can also eliminate that his success at \"finding\" is not \"an inevitable consequence of my mind searching for causal structure in reality, so that I can learn and adapt to my environment.\" [2]\n\nWhen I told Hunter to find where I lived when I brought him home, where my cousin lives in Hidden Hills, and where I lived in Agoura Hills in 1974 [3] he was telepathically accessing my explicit memories of the locations at the request of my conscious mind.\n\nImplicit memories are those that are mostly Unconscious\n\nWhen Hunter found where I worked in 1972, he was telepathically accessing my implicit memory of the Informata office in Encino, at the request of my unconscious mind, the hippocampus.\n\nNext Page 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Dogs", "Telepathy"], "tags": ["Dogs", "Telepathy"], "authors": ["Fred Gransville"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Article: Hunter finds Schuylkill: The", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"description": "Article: Hunter finds Schuylkill: The", "keywords": "Dogs,Telepathy", "fb": {"admins": 737810614, "app_id": 157889207614942}, "generator": "Populum - \ufeffContent management software for hybrid blog/media/commerce communities", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"url": "https://www.opednews.com/articles/Hunter-finds-Schuylkill-T-by-Fred-Gransville-Dogs_Telepathy-191227-872.html", "site_name": "OpEdNews", "title": "Hunter finds Schuylkill: The", "description": "I found scientific research that supported my conclusion that telepathic human and animal communication is possible, so I formed the hypothesis; Hunter can only find a location that either I knew consciously or subconsciously, or someone I was connected to, knew consciously or subconsciously.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.opednews.com/populum/visuals/2019/12/2019-12-77017-500-Uploaded-hunter-4199-schuylkill-drive-329.jpg", "width": 650, "height": 650}, "type": "website", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"title": "Hunter finds Schuylkill: The", "description": "I found scientific research that supported my conclusion that telepathic human and animal communication is possible, so I formed the hypothesis; Hunter can only find a location that either I knew consciously or subconsciously, or someone I was connected to, knew consciously or subconsciously.", "image": "https://www.opednews.com/populum/visuals/2019/12/2019-12-77017-500-Uploaded-hunter-4199-schuylkill-drive-329.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@opednews"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.opednews.com/articles/Hunter-finds-Schuylkill-T-by-Fred-Gransville-Dogs_Telepathy-191227-872.html"}
