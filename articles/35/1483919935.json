I know I played two horrendous shots in the last game but, in many ways, the fact that I'm getting myself out and not being got out, means I can deal with that. So long as it's not too frequently, anyway.\n\n\"I'm moving well. I'm hitting the ball well. I've just got to keep my feet moving, stay busy and go about my business the way I have for four or five years.\n\n\"It's felt much better this last week or so; it feels like it's just clicked in. We've all been in situations before where it just takes one boundary, or negotiating one delivery and everything just slips back in and you feel you've batting for four or five hours. I've generally been quite consistent. And even if things have not felt right, I've managed to score runs. I've got to trust that that's going to come. I'm not far away.\"\n\nWhatever his recent struggles, Root's enthusiasm for batting - and the captaincy - is undiminished. He has reiterated that he has no intention of giving up any format of the game and says he is as committed to the captaincy as ever.\n\nALSO READ: Who could take over from Root?\n\n\"Regardless of whatever the schedule is, I will always continue to keep working on my batting,\" he said. \"I love it. One of the perks of playing cricket for a living is you get to do one of your favourite things.\n\n\"I have no plans to quit any format of cricket. I want to keep playing as much as I can. I know that there'll be a day when my back's gone, or I wake up and I physically can't do it anymore. So I want to make the most of it when I can. I'm very fortunate to be in the position where I captain England and play for England. It's the best job in the world in so many ways.\"\n\nRoot's decline in the rankings has been dramatic. From a high point of No. 1 in 2015, he has declined to the point where he is not only no longer in the top 10, but a couple of places behind Ben Stokes at No. 9. But his focus, he says, is not on personal achievement.\n\n\"I think the rankings are there for you guys in the media to talk about,\" he says. \"My focus, as a batter and a captain, is winning Test matches. That's what matters. I'd take a pair for a win. But we're more likely to win if I score a double-hundred.\"\n\nEngland have an optional training session on Thursday afternoon in Hamilton; the second Test starts on Friday.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["England tour of New Zealand", "England", "England in New Zealand 2019-20", "Joe Root", "England", "Cricket"], "tags": [], "authors": ["George Dobell In Hamilton", "Espncricinfo Staff", "The Report Hemant Brar", "Saurabh Somani In Lucknow", "Danyal Rasool", "The Preview Matt Roller", "The Preview Andrew Mcglashan", "Matt Roller", "George Dobell", "Deivarayan Muthu"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Captain made only 13 runs in first Test, but claims he is 'not far away' from his best | ESPNcricinfo.com", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://a.espncdn.com/prod/assets/icons/espncricinfo.svg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "description": "Captain made only 13 runs in first Test, but claims he is 'not far away' from his best | ESPNcricinfo.com", "news_keywords": "England tour of New Zealand, England, England in New Zealand 2019-20, Joe Root, England, Cricket", "keywords": "England tour of New Zealand, England, England in New Zealand 2019-20, Joe Root, England, Cricket", "DC.date.issued": "2019-11-27T21:53:38Z", "fb": {"app_id": 260890547115, "pages": 104266592953439}, "og": {"site_name": "ESPNcricinfo", "url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28178478/return-form-just-round-corner-insists-joe-root", "title": "Return to form 'just round the corner' insists Joe Root", "description": "Captain made only 13 runs in first Test, but claims he is 'not far away' from his best | ESPNcricinfo.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fi%2Fcricket%2Fcricinfo%2F1208245_1296x729.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 729}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"site": "@espncricinfo", "url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28178478/return-form-just-round-corner-insists-joe-root", "title": "Return to form 'just round the corner' insists Joe Root", "description": "Captain made only 13 runs in first Test, but claims he is 'not far away' from his best | ESPNcricinfo.com", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ESPNcricinfo", "googleplay": "ESPNcricinfo"}, "id": {"iphone": 417408017, "googleplay": "com.july.cricinfo"}, "url": {"iphone": "espncricinfo://x-callback-url/showStory?uid=28178478", "googleplay": "espncricinfo://x-callback-url/showStory?uid=28178478"}}}, "title": "Return to form 'just round the corner' insists Joe Root | ESPNcricinfo.com", "medium": "article", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=417408017, app-argument=espncricinfo://x-callback-url/showStory?uid=28178478"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28178478/return-form-just-round-corner-insists-joe-root"}
