after being forced to retire from Oxford University.\n\nPaul Ewart (71) was forced to leave his post as Oxford's head of atomic and laser physics before his 70th birthday.\n\nHe told the Belfast Telegraph that \"a scientist's best work can come at any age\" and that he felt vindicated in his fight against Oxford's \"ageist\" retirement rules.\n\nIt's expected that the university will now be under pressure to roll back on a controversial policy allowing them to dismiss academics at the age of 67 to make way for younger and more diverse staff.\n\nOnly Cambridge University and St Andrews University also adopt this rule.\n\nProfessor Ewart said he agreed there needed to be more diversity and opportunities for young people at Oxford, but discriminating against older staff was not the right way to do it.\n\nHe is now set to receive at least \u00a3150,000 in back pay and hopes to be reinstated, having spent \u00a330,000 of his own money on the case.", "keywords": [],
