"movies": [], "text": "Sen. Lindsey Graham suggested changing the rules for impeachment if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continues to withhold the articles from the Senate.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican explained that the Senate plans to follow the rules used during the impeachment trial for President Bill Clinton, but that has been delayed because of Pelosi\u2019s refusal to hand over the articles. Graham told Sunday Morning Futures that he wants the Senate to conclude impeachment by January and suggested that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reconsider his strategy for impeachment if Pelosi doesn\u2019t work with the Senate.\n\n\u201cI find it a political stunt for Nancy Pelosi not to send the articles over. Mitch McConnell is not going to let her run the Senate trial. Her time is over. It is now time for the Senate to dispose of these impeachment articles with a trial in Senate,\u201d Graham said.\n\nHe later added, \u201cWell, we\u2019re not going to let Nancy Pelosi use the rules of the Senate to her advantage. This is dangerous for the presidency as an institution. They have impeached the president, but the speaker of the House is holding the articles back trying to extort from the majority leader of the Senate a trial to her liking.\u201d\n\nGraham explained that McConnell could change the rules of the Senate in a way that would allow the upper chamber to start the impeachment trial, even if Pelosi does not cooperate.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get the articles this week, then we need to take matters in our own hands and change the rules. Deem them delivered to the Senate so we can start the trial. Invite the House to participate if they would like. If they don\u2019t come, dismiss the case and get on with governing the country,\u201d said Graham.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Nancy Pelosi", "Beltway Confidential", "Mitch McConnell", "News", "Impeachment", "Lindsey Graham", "Adam Schiff", "Donald Trump", "Senate"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sun Jan  5 22:27:22 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Sen.
