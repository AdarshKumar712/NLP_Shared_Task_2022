They kept the ship away over concerns that it would expose them to the new virus from China.\n\nThe Westerdam was unwelcome elsewhere even though operator Holland America Line said no cases of the COVID-19 viral illness have been confirmed among its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew members.\n\nThe ship initially anchored offshore, where a team of health officials began checks. It then moved at sunset to a berth at the port in the Gulf of Thailand.\n\n\u201cLanded!\u201d passenger Lydia Miller, who runs a small farm and inn in Washington State, exclaimed on Twitter. \u201cThank you Cambodia!
