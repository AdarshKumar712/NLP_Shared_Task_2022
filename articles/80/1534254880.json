It\u2019s one of those job interviews where you show up and instead of one person interviewing you, three do. Or, if you\u2019re really lucky, five or six will. I\u2019m not talking about a situation where you have one interview after another. I\u2019m talking about a single interview where you\u2019re facing off with multiple people at a time around a single table.\n\nIf you interview people, you should know that panel interviews are scary for the candidate. I\u2019ve seen these at all levels, from right out of college to senior executives. Very rarely are people comfortable with this kind of interview format. If your goal is to be welcoming, avoid this interview setup if you can. Or, provide as much information to the candidate ahead of time so they can prepare.\n\nIf you\u2019re the candidate, you should know that the company doesn\u2019t intend to scare you. They have probably scheduled you for a panel interview because it takes less time. They can interview you all at once. Also, a panel interview is not a place where you\u2019ll find yourself attacked by the panelists.\n\nIn your mind, you may picture an adversarial meeting at work. It\u2019s you versus a team of people when something goes wrong. But, that should not be the case in a panel interview. You don\u2019t yet work at the company and should be welcoming and kind.\n\nIn a panel interview, it\u2019s very likely that each person will have one or two predetermined questions they will ask you. And, it\u2019s also possible that not everyone in the room is excited to be there. They may also be nervous. Or, they may be doing the hiring manager a favor by participating in the panel.\n\nBefore you have a panel interview, ask the human resources recruiter for an agenda of the people you\u2019ll be talking to. Use that agenda to research each person, so you\u2019ll be prepared in advance. During the interview, stay calm and be friendly. Treat each person equally and with respect. Be sure to shake the hand of everyone you meet.\n\nAfterward, send each person a thank you email. Don\u2019t send one mass email. Send a separate email for each individual person. If you can, customize each email to reflect something that aligns to the person\u2019s background or something they honed in on during your interview. But, keep it positive. Don\u2019t use the emails to apologize. Thank the person for their time and keep going. If you\u2019re feeling especially interested in a role, take the time to also send a hand written thank you note to every person. If you do this, you\u2019ll very likely be the only candidate who did \u2013 and it will make you stand out in a good way.\n\nRemember: every interview is practice for the next one. And, you don\u2019t have to answer every question perfectly to get a job offer.\n\nAngela Copeland, a career expert and founder of Copeland Coaching, can be reached at copelandcoaching.com.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["career corner", "job search", "career", "columns"], "authors": ["Angela Copeland", "Angela Copeland On February"], "publish_date": "Thu Feb 27 10:52:10 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "template": "Mission News 1.36", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Career Corner: Panel Interview Fears - Duarte Dispatch", "description": "By Angela Copeland Have you ever had a panel interview?
