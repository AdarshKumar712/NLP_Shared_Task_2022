On a slightly different note, this week, Trump\u2019s former general election opponent Hillary Clinton issued a message for the New Year holiday that put exactly what America is missing with Trump in the White House on full display. In short, it\u2019s missing the chance at attention to basic human qualities like humility and kindness. Who in their right mind would call Trump humble or kind?\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton tweeted:\n\n\u2018There\u2019s something all of us can do to be braver, more resilient, kinder, and more grateful. This holiday season, that\u2019s my wish for all of us. Happy New Year!\u2019\n\nThere's something all of us can do to be braver, more resilient, kinder, and more grateful. This holiday season, that\u2019s my wish for all of us. Happy New Year! \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) December 31, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s own last post of the year was a video of remarks he delivered to reporters at a New Year\u2019s Eve party at his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort. In other words, as the year and decade drew to a close, his focus was quite literally on a video of himself talking, like he just can\u2019t get enough of looking in the mirror while plenty of Americans struggle and suffer. Hours before, he\u2019d posted an all caps message of \u201cHAPPY NEW YEAR!\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s it. As of about noon eastern time on January 1, he\u2019d made no posts with public statements for the new year.\n\nHAPPY NEW YEAR! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 1, 2020\n\nNow that the new year has gotten underway, Congress will be facing the question of what to do with the impeachment of Trump finalized shortly before Christmas by the House.\n\nClinton has repeatedly publicly supported that impeachment, noting in reference to Trump\u2019s leadership of the Ukraine quid pro quo scandal:\n\n\u2018It is a story of abuse of power, using the office of the president to further not the nation\u2019s objectives but his own personal political objectives. The facts are not in dispute\u2026 It\u2019s really important to me that I do everything I can and make sure that we retire the incumbent regardless of what happens.\u2019\n\nDemocrats have grown increasingly concerned about explicit Republican pledges against fairness and impartiality, and while deliberations around the parameters of an impeachment trial have proceeded, Dems have delayed transmitting the impeachment case to the Senate altogether, which has given the president and his allies just another occasion to freak out.\n\nCheck out Twitter\u2019s response below\u2026", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Hillary Clinton", "new year's eve"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://bipartisanreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/b2defe26-favicon-300x300.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, \ninitial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://bipartisanreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hillary-one.png", "secure_url": "https://bipartisanreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hillary-one.png", "width": 640, "height": 390}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hillary Shows Trump How To Lead With 2020 Message To America", "description": "President Donald Trump will never escape the shadow of the actual effective leadership of his opponents \u2014 just look at how attached he seems to obsessing over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).
