welcomed the first babies of 2020 early Wednesday morning.\n\nA bouncing baby boy was born at exactly the stroke of midnight at Humber River Hospital in Toronto. Weighing a healthy 8.3 pounds, Amiir Deeq Mohammed could be seen Wednesday afternoon in his mother\u2019s arms, swaddled in a knit blue blanket.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy,\u201d the boy\u2019s father said. \u201cI am excited to have this wonderful, special baby boy.\u201d\n\nDeeq Mohammed Farah said that his son was due a couple of weeks ago, so the family was not expecting a new year\u2019s baby.\n\n\u201cWhen the baby came, at the right time, the attendants, nurses and doctors, they explained it really well. They said you hit the new year,\u201d Farah said. \u201cIt was a great surprise,\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle boy.\u201d\n\nTrillium Health Partners, a hospital system that serves certain areas of the GTA, said that their first baby of the year was delivered just 50 seconds after midnight on New Year\u2019s Day at Credit Valley Hospital in Mississauga.\n\nThe little boy, named Aryan, weighed in at about eight pounds.\n\nSpeaking with CP24 on Wednesday morning, the baby\u2019s mother said that, at the time, she had no idea Aryan was the first child born in Mississauga this year.\n\n\u201cWhen the baby was delivered, everyone was so excited,\u201d Anu Walia said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty seconds into the new year and we got this little precious gift,\u201d Simran Walia said while holding his newborn son in his arms.\n\nAnu Walia\u2019s delivery date was scheduled for Jan. 13 and she said that her family was already preparing for a 2020 baby\u2014but those plans were put on hold when she went into labour early.\n\n\u201cMy maternity photoshoot, my baby shower, all the decorations, everything was planned around 2020, so when the labour hit yesterday, I was like, \u2018oh my gosh all that is going to go to waste now,\u2019\u201d Anu Walia said. \u201cBut the baby actually helped us out and came after the new year.\u201d\n\nOther hospitals ring in New Year with newborns\n\nMount Sinai Hospital in Toronto welcomed its first bundle of joy at 12:13 a.m. and Lakeridge Health in Oshawa announced their first baby was born at 12:34 a.m.\n\nAt North York General Hospital, Kert Lin was born at 5:51 a.m.\n\n\"Congrats to the family and happy birthday to all our New Years babies,\" the hospital said.",
