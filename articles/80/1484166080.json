The crew was forced to shelter in their truck as the fire front passed through. #NSWFires #ProtectTheIrreplaceable pic.twitter.com/Hb0yVrefi9 \u2014 Fire and Rescue NSW (@FRNSW) December 31, 2019\n\nFirefighters were deployed to protect those stranded on the beach, and preparations are underway for a sea or airborne evacuation if needed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got three strike teams in Mallacoota that will be looking after 4,000 people down on the beach there. We\u2019re naturally very concerned about communities that have become isolated,\u201d he added.\n\nHundreds of people have taken to social media to share apocalyptic images of the area, which is currently blanketed in a thick cloud of red haze.\n\nCommunity radio in #Mallacoota: \u201cThe power is cut. We are isolated. It\u2019s a holocaust, basically. Some have been sent to the hall, some to the lake, others have to stay in their homes. There\u2019s a lot of thunder. The fires are creating their own weather.\u201d \u2014 Alt-Rupert (@TheMurdochTimes) December 30, 2019\n\nIt comes after authorities warned up to 30,000 tourists currently visiting the area to leave as strong winds pushed an emergency-level bushfire towards the town.\n\nThe fire moving towards Mallacoota began at Wingan River on Sunday and spread rapidly towards the coast, RNZ reported.\n\nMeanwhile, in a press conference on Tuesday, Premier Daniel Andrews said that four people are currently missing in Victoria.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of people who remain unaccounted for\u2014four people, and of course we have fears for their safety,\u201d Andrews said.\n\n\u201cWe cannot confirm their whereabouts, but as soon as we can bring any further information to you, then, of course, we will do that.\u201d\n\nAndrews also asked Prime Minister Scott Morrison for military assistance amid the raging fires, suggesting naval vessels help get supplies to isolated communities or heavy-lift aircraft to work alongside the state\u2019s air fleet.\n\nHowever, no decisions regarding military assistance have been finalized as of yet.\n\nFrancesca Winterson is in a building on the main street of #Mallacoota and describes the wind, darkness and falling embers as fires burn about 500 metres away. She says it\u2019s too late to leave and fire crews are on hand to offer as much protection as they can. pic.twitter.com/6Tjfb4nyUR \u2014 News Breakfast (@BreakfastNews) December 30, 2019\n\nOn Monday, around 100,000 people were urged to flee five Melbourne suburbs. The swirling bushfires killed a volunteer firefighter who was battling a separate blaze in the countryside.\n\nAnother volunteer firefighter from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service also died on Monday when the truck he was traveling in was overturned by strong winds and crashed at Jingellic, about 110 kilometers (68 miles) east of Albury.\n\nAuthorities named him as 28-year-old Samuel McPaul, who was reportedly expecting his first child in May with his wife, Megan, whom he married last year.\n\nTwo of his male colleagues, aged 39 and 52, also suffered burns in the incident but are said to be in a stable condition.\n\nAnother eight people have been killed so far this fire season, while more than 1,000 homes have been destroyed, according to local reports.\n\n\n\nAlex Jones lays out the motifs between mass shootings in the United States (shooters on pharmaceutical drugs, ignored FBI and police reports, 24/7 mainstream media coverage, etc.) and analyzes the most recent church shooting in White Settlement, Texas.\n\nAlso, start your year right with free shipping and up to 75% off our hottest items during the Mega Blowout Sale!", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 09:19:29 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.infowars.com/wp-content/themes/infowars-sitegoals/images/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png", "meta_data": {"robots": "NOODP", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 100000730726880}, "og": {"url": "https://www.infowars.com/thousands-stranded-on-beach-encircled-by-flames-as-bushfires-rip-through-australia/", "title": "Thousands Stranded on Beach Encircled By Flames as Bushfires Rip Through Australia", "description": "Over 4,000 people trapped by massive fires", "type": "article", "image": "https://assets.infowars.com/2020/01/FireAusGetty1120.jpg"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "17524d28613d659f78532053a49ecd5b"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.9.8", "googlebot-news": "noindex, nofollow", "article": {"section": "Featured Stories", "published_time": "2020-01-01T09:19:29-06:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T13:20:56-06:00"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.infowars.com/thousands-stranded-on-beach-encircled-by-flames-as-bushfires-rip-through-australia/"}
