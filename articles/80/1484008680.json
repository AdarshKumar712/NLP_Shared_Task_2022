It didn\u2019t help that the first tow truck that attempted to move the float failed, and a second truck was needed to take the float to the end of the route. It wasn\u2019t pretty.\n\nBut this year, parade officials put together new safety protocols and procedures float builders had to abide by to prevent another float fire. An investigation concluded the fire was most likely caused by an accidental discharge of transmission fluid onto the float\u2019s exhaust pipe. The Tournament of Roses now requires float builders to install fire suppression measures similar to ones on buses, dispersing fire retardant powder in the event engines overheat, as well as fire barriers protecting driver compartments.\n\nOK. Now, for the fun stuff that hopefully you will see.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re cozied up on the couch in your pjs with the TV on and a cup of joe or hot chocolate in reach. Maybe you\u2019re bundled up on Colorado Boulevard, your face cool in the crisp morning Pasadena air.\n\nEither way, we have a few suggestions on what to watch for in this year\u2019s Tournament of Roses Parade. First off, note that this year\u2019s parade theme is \u201cThe Power of Hope.\u201d\n\nSo, fueled by that theme, organizers have created a parade event that really takes hold of the idea of rising up from adversity and tragedy but also mixed that with themes of healing and optimism as the decade kicks off. In that sense, all of the entries have a story to tell, and represent a part of the overall theme.\n\nBut, since there are 90 entries, and we\u2019ve only got so many inches here \u2014 and a deadline \u2014 here are 20 or so moments to keep an eye on as you watch the 131st Rose Parade with that warm drink in your grasp. We tagged a number to the end, so you\u2019ll see where it comes in the parade lineup. You can find all the acts listed in order here.\n\nGET THIS PARTY STARTED\n\nRose Parade Opening Spectacular. Look for Ally Brooke, Emilio Estefan, Farruko and the Chino Hills High School Drumline (Parade Entry #1)\n\nUP IN THE SKIES\u2026\n\nB-2 Spirit Flyover. The sight of that thing flying overhead as the event begins is just hard to ignore. Frankly, TV doesn\u2019t do it justice. But you just gotta watch it. It sets quite the tone for the parade march \u2014 assuming you still have your hearing. (#2)\n\nTERRIFIC TRIO\n\nThe grand marshals. It\u2019s hard not to root for Rita Moreno and her co-grand marshals, Gina Torres and Laurie Hernandez. All represent generations of Latin American women who have climbed their own heights in stage and sport, and have inspired others in their journey. (#11)\n\nROYALS TIMES SEVEN\n\nThe Royal Court. How will Rose Queen Camille Kennedy and her court of Pasadena-area princesses stay warm for 5.5 miles? (#24)\n\nMORNING OF HONOR\n\nPasadena City College Tournament of Roses Honor Band. Four musicians from Saugus High, who endured the trauma of the Nov. 14 fatal shootings on campus, were chosen to appear with this band. They called the experience a great honor and a great boost to their ability to cope with the tragedy. (#25)\n\nWORTH YOUR VOTE\n\n\u201cYears of Hope. Years of Courage.\u201d This is a really unique chance to be up close with a landmark moment \u2014 and history. This float pays homage to the struggle for women\u2019s suffrage, celebrating 100 years of women voting. Riding on it will be civil rights giants and descendants of giants such as Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglas. (#26)\n\nTHE GRANDDADDY\u2019S KIDS\n\nRose Bowl floats and bands. What would the parade be without a little pre-Rose Bowl fun \u2014 like a massive pep rally for Oregon and Wisconsin. Keep an eye out for Rose Bowl Game floats and bands. (#28, 29, 38 and 39)\n\nLISTEN UP\n\nBanda Municipal de Zarcero. Watching the marching bands live can be mesmerizing. They\u2019re coming from all regions of the U.S. \u2014 from Pasadena to Mississippi. And from the world \u2014 from the Japan Honor Green Band to the Elsinore Girls Marching Band from Denmark. We recommend them all, but keep an eye \u2014 and an ear \u2014 out for this one, Banda, from Costa Rica. (#41)\n\nTHAT YOU, OLAF?\n\nHalftime! LADIES and GENTLEMEN, BOYS AND GIRLS, HORSES AND SNOWMEN! A mid-parade performance of Disney\u2019s \u201cFrozen.\u201d Let it gooooo! (#48)\n\nYOU GO, GIRLS\n\nMid-America Cowgirls Rodeo Drill Team. The Rose Parade equestrian units are always a treat. They\u2019ll all rock this year. The Cowgirls did just that (rocked it, that is) at the nearby Equestfest at the LA Equestrian Center in Burbank. (#55)\n\nTINY BUT MIGHTY\n\nMini-Therapy horses. All together now: Awwwwww. Make sure the kids see this group. (#59)\n\nMIGHTY AND MAMMOTH\n\nBudweiser Clydesdales. Make sure the kids see this one, too. And they\u2019re harder to miss! (#63)\n\nSALVADORAN STRUT\n\nBanda El Salvador: Grando Como Su Gente. That name translates roughly as \u201cband as big as its people.\u201d Rose Princess Mia Thorsen, whose family has roots in El Salvador, got to spend the day with performers from this band at Bandfest on Monday. (#77)\n\nROCKIN\u2019 THE AGES\n\nThe Salvation Army Tournament of Roses band. It\u2019s marched in the event for 100 years. (#83)\n\nSTORIES OF HOPE & LIFE\n\nCity of Hope and Donate Life floats. Stories of survival and sacrifice on these. (#83 and #84)\n\nHOWLIN\u2019 FINALE\n\nClosing show: \u201cWhere Flowers and Football meet!\u201d When Los Lobos performs, good things happen (#90).\n\n\u2014\n\nThe parade begins at 8 a.m. on Wednesday morning. But you knew that. It\u2019ll be televised live.\n\nYou\u2019re invited to keep up with us on Twitter, from our reporters in the field Wednesday @PasStarNews.
