Lunden Roberts, a professional stripper, is Hunter\u2019s baby mama.\n\n(DailyMail.com) \u2026in a 30-page filing, Caplan lays out how he was allegedly swindled out of 10 years of his life savings in a \u2018multi-billion dollar stock scheme known as the China Hustle.\n\nCaplan, who filed papers from Jerusalem, Israel, claims many Chinese nationals made fortunes from the ploy, which involved presenting fake company documents and claiming they were genuine investments when they were actual frauds.\n\nThen they went on to use the ill-gotten gains to influence politics and even \u2018bribe\u2019 individuals, such as Biden, Caplan claims.\n\nBiden: China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man\u2026 I mean, you know, they\u2019re not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they\u2019re not competition for us.\u201d\n\nAnother exclusive look at @SteveHiltonx\u2019s interview with @realDonaldTrump where Steve asks the president about @JoeBiden\u2019s ties to China \u2013 be sure to catch the full interview this Sunday at 9PM ET on @FoxNews! #NextRevFNC pic.twitter.com/66exg8bkUk \u2014 The Next Revolution (@NextRevFNC) May 17, 2019\n\nCaplan is asking Judge McSpadden to all investigators to \u2018follow the money\u2019 and present what they find as part of the evidence in the case.\n\nIf the judge grants Caplan\u2019s request, we can speculate where this eventually leads.\n\n(Capital Research) As president, Bill Clinton essentially wiped out any strategic advantage the U.S. had by selling advanced U.S. missile technology to our enemy, the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nThat \u201cadministration\u2019s voluntary release of all the secrets of America\u2019s nuclear tests, combined with the systematic theft of the secrets that were left as a result of its lax security controls, effectively wiped out America\u2019s technological edge,\u201d David Horowitz writes in the recently published, The Black Book of the American Left Volume 7: The Left in Power: Clinton to Obama.\n\nUnlike the administrations that preceded it, the Clinton administration accepted millions of dollars from the military and intelligence services of at least one hostile foreign power. All of this was done in exchange for illegal campaign contributions from a massive totalitarian country determined to eclipse the U.S. as a world superpower.\n\nPresident Clinton also lifted security controls, allowing thieves to access other vital military technologies, while disarming his own side and opposing needed defenses.\n\n\u201cOne of the key technological breaks China received, without having to spy to get it, was the deliverance of supercomputers once banned from export for security reasons,\u201d writes Horowitz.\n\nThis article originally appeared at and was republished with permission.\n\nScroll down to leave a comment!\n\nJoin us at SPREELY if you want REAL NEWS without the leftist censorship!\n\nAlso join us at MUMBLIT!\n\nDean James at Right Wing Tribune\n\nGod Bless.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["We Are Biased Opinion Blog"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "THIS IS HUGE!", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "description": "THIS IS HUGE!", "robots": "noimageindex", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New Court Filing Puts Biden In Panic Mode As \u201cChina Hustle\u201d, A Multi-Billion Alleged Stock Fraud Scheme Comes To Light", "description": "THIS IS HUGE!", "url": "https://rightwingtribune.com/2020/01/01/biden-in-panic-mode/", "site_name": "Right Wing Tribune", "image": {"identifier": "https://rightwingtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2677.jpg", "secure_url": "https://rightwingtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2677.jpg", "width": 647, "height": 356}}, "article": {"tag": "Chinese", "section": "Home", "published_time": "2020-01-01T22:29:43+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 638165103237854}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "THIS IS HUGE!", "title": "New Court Filing Puts Biden In Panic Mode As \u201cChina Hustle\u201d, A Multi-Billion Alleged Stock Fraud Scheme Comes To Light", "image": "https://rightwingtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2677.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://rightwingtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cropped-favicon-logo-1.png", "googlebot": "noimageindex"}, "canonical_link": "https://rightwingtribune.com/2020/01/01/biden-in-panic-mode/"}
