"movies": [], "text": "One of the two suspects in the recent kosher deli shooting had published anti-Semitic and anti-police posts online.\n\nInvestigators believe that Tuesday\u2019s attack on a Jewish-owned market in Jersey City, New Jersey, was motivated by anti-Semitic sentiments, according to the New York Times. The shooting ended with six people dead, including the two gunmen who carried out the attack and prolonged gunfight with the police.\n\nA brief, \u201crambling\u201d manifesto was also found in the van that the assailants were driving, but the note provided no motive for the shooting. A live pipe bomb was also found inside the van during a search by investigators.\n\nThe violence began near a cemetery where the suspects fatally shot Jersey City Police Department Detective Joseph Seals, 40, in the head. Seals had approached the van because it was tied to another homicide over the weekend. Surveillance video showed that after killing Seals, the duo drove slowly to the kosher deli about a mile away.\n\n\u201cThe perpetrators stopped in front of there and calmly opened the door with two long rifles,\u201d Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said.\n\nAfter getting out of the van, surveillance footage shows them enter the market while firing their guns, killing three more people. The shooting was described as a \u201ctargeted\u201d attack. They then began an extensive firefight with the police and other responding forces, which caused a lockdown of the area and of schools across the entire city.\n\nLaw enforcement managed to kill the two assailants during the gunfight, which lasted for more than an hour.\n\nThe attack took place in Jersey City\u2019s Greenville neighborhood, where several Hasidic Jewish families have moved to from Brooklyn, New York, in recent years. The kosher market that was targeted opened about three years ago and was a central hub of the area\u2019s Jewish community.\n\nAlthough there has been speculation that the shooters were Muslim, the mayor said that there is \u201czero indication to that being accurate.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Law enforcement", "Crime", "Mass shootings", "Religion", "Anti-Semitism", "New Jersey"], "tags": ["Beltway Confidential", "News", "Crime", "Gun Violence", "New Jersey", "Judaism", "anti-Semitism"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Dec 11 16:55:49 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "One of the two suspects in the recent kosher deli shooting had published anti-Semitic and anti-police posts online.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "pages": "page"}, "description": "One of the two suspects in the recent kosher deli shooting had published anti-Semitic and anti-police posts online.", "keywords": "Law enforcement,Crime,Mass shootings,Religion,Anti-Semitism,New Jersey", "brightspot.contentId": "0000016e-f5d1-d836-a7ee-f7fdd6410000", "og": {"title": "Kosher market shooter published anti-Semitic posts before 'targeted' attack", "url": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kosher-market-shooter-published-anti-semitic-posts-before-targeted-attack", "image": {"identifier": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/71770e2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+60/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fed%2F98%2F5e563874433e95b75ca465b10629%2Fshooting-121119.jpg", "url": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/71770e2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+60/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fed%2F98%2F5e563874433e95b75ca465b10629%2Fshooting-121119.jpg", "secure_url": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/71770e2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+60/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fed%2F98%2F5e563874433e95b75ca465b10629%2Fshooting-121119.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/png", "alt": "Shooting Jersey City"}, "description": "One of the two suspects in the recent kosher deli shooting had published anti-Semitic and anti-police posts online.", "site_name": "Washington Examiner", "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/author/zachary-halaschak", "published_time": "2019-12-11T16:55:49.206", "modified_time": "2019-12-11T17:09:35.306", "section": "News", "tag": "Gun Violence"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "One of the two suspects in the recent kosher deli shooting had published anti-Semitic and anti-police posts online.", "image": {"identifier": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0f2fe69/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1288+0+17/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fed%2F98%2F5e563874433e95b75ca465b10629%2Fshooting-121119.jpg", "alt": "Shooting Jersey City"}, "site": "@DCExaminer", "title": "Kosher market shooter published anti-Semitic posts before 'targeted' attack", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "brightspot.cached": "true", "dy": {"url": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kosher-market-shooter-published-anti-semitic-posts-before-targeted-attack"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kosher-market-shooter-published-anti-semitic-posts-before-targeted-attack"}
