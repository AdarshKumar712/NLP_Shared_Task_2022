The Midlands and the North was getting HS2 while we were still coping with average speeds that the Victorians would have recognised and weather-resilience that their engineers would have been appalled by.\n\nWe embraced the smartphone that was a novelty in 2010 and is an essential for most of us in 2020. But in many parts of the Westcountry we couldn\u2019t use them because of reception \u201cnot spots\u201d.\n\nParts of the South West have some of the fastest broadband speeds in the UK, but many in rural areas, hampered by a snail\u2019s-pace link, can only dream of enjoying what became the norm this decade, streaming of television services.\n\n(Image: Publicity Picture)\n\nElectric cars were a curiosity ten years ago, are commonplace now and will probably be driverless before the new decade is over. But too many South West roads are potholed, narrow and congested.\n\nIn 2010 few would ever have dreamed that the UK\u2019s first horizontal launch spaceport would be in the Westcountry. Now we are told the first flights will began from Spaceport Cornwall in Newquay next year , thanks to backing from Cornwall Council and the Government, confirmed last year.\n\nA decade ago, a few miles along the coast, the focus was on one of Cornwall\u2019s more traditional industries and the culture associated with it: Port Isaac-based sea-shanty singers Fisherman\u2019s Friends won a \u00a31-million record deal.\n\nThe same year saw the death of a famous Plymothian, former leader of the Labour Party and one of the country\u2019s greatest radical idealists, Michael Foot.\n\nHis brand of socialism was dusted off and offered to a new generation as the decade ended, and was rejected as Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party was trounced by the Conservatives. Boris Johnson became the third Conservative Prime Minister of the decade having surpassed and outlived \u2013 in political terms \u2013 David Cameron, his former rival who came to power in the May 2010 general election.\n\nMr Cameron needed the support of the Liberal Democrats and their leader, Nick Clegg, to become PM as the two parties formed a coalition government, the first in 70 years.\n\nFew political analysts doubted the partnership could be formed swiftly and even fewer thought that it would last. The team stayed together. sustained by the friendship between the two, until the Tories ruthlessly targeted the Lib Dems in the 2015 general election and the third party was wiped from the map in the South West.\n\nDespite this being one of their strongholds for decades the Lib Dems have yet to recover in the two elections since.\n\nNobody used the word \u201cBrexit\u201d in 2010. By 2020 most are sick of it.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe European Union referendum of 2016 that Mr Cameron thought would remove the issue for a generation at least, instead extended the division throughout the nation, removed him from office, would go on to destroy the premiership of his successor, Theresa May, paralyse politics for four years and help propel Mr Johnson into No 10.\n\nThe South West voted to leave, but the split drove through communities and families in the region. Cornwall, the UK region that most benefited from EU aid, was solidly in favour of Brexit in the referendum.\n\nThe EU stamp on the duchy extended beyond bricks and mortar to include one of the lighter stories of the decade, Protected Geographical Indication.\n\nSince 2011 to be called a Cornish pasty the favourite food must be made west of the Tamar and to a certain recipe. Bizarrely, the pasty was also the focus of one of the most memorable political U-turns of the decade: the Government\u2019s \u201cpasty tax\u201d \u2013 a plan to include the food as the levy was extended to hot takeaway foods \u2013 was withdrawn after fierce lobbying against the 2012 Budget measure.\n\nSport was the big story of 2012, though: the Olympic flame arrived in Culdrose Cornwall, accompanied by sporting royalty (David Beckham) and real royalty (Princess Anne).\n\nThe torch was carried by runners through the South West on the way to London. The games brought double success to many South West athletes: Cornwall\u2019s four-times gold medal winning sailor, Ben Ainslie, was knighted, while Devon horsewoman Mary King, Penzance teacher-turned rower Helen Glover and paralympic swimmer Jonathan Fox, from St Stephen near St Austell, were all made MBEs, in the New Year Honours.\n\nCommunication rather faster than that Olympic flame relay provided the story of 2013 which touched on some themes of the decade: privacy, surveillance and the ability of a whistle-blower to wreak havoc.\n\nOne of the revelations exposed by the US intelligence officer, Edward Snowden, was the use of GCHQ Bude to eavesdrop on internet traffic. We learned that the spy centre was part-funded by the US National Security Agency.\n\nAnother US-UK collaboration, the war in Afghanistan, came to an end in 2014, at last as far as full British involvement. The 13-year campaign cost the lives of 453 British servicemen, including 77 from the Westcountry or serving with units based in the South West region.\n\nTwo other wars were in mind through the decade, as anniversaries of the key dates in the First and Second World Wars were remembered.\n\nFormer servicemen from across the Westcountry made the journey across the Channel once again to commemorate 70 years since D-Day in June 2014.\n\nDue to the ravages of age fewer were able to repeat the journey for the 75th anniversary this year. Communities that hosted US servicemen who trained in the region before heading to the Normandy landings also marked the dates.\n\nThe 100th anniversaries of the start and end of the First World War, in 2014 and 2018, were also marked. Among the most moving tributes was by Somerset artist Rob Heard\u2019s Shrouds of the Somme project.\n\nHis 19,240 miniature shrouded figures were first laid out in Exeter in 2016 \u2013 100 years after the start of the battle \u2013 and the project was extended to remember all 72,396 Allied soldiers killed on day one.\n\nExeter was the focus of national attention in October 2016 when a devastating fire destroyed key buildings on the Cathedral Green, the most prominent being England\u2019s oldest Hotel, the Royal Clarence.\n\n(Image: MARK PASSMORE)\n\nExtremes of heat, and of the weather, generally, were never far from the news during the decade. The many, many highs included two this year alone: the warmest-ever winter day, 21.2C (70.2F) in Kew Gardens in London on February 26 and the hottest-ever day, 38.7C (101.7F), in Cambridge on July 25.\n\nThere was, well, a spate of floods. Pick almost any year or season for an example, say December 2010 in Cornwall or in the South West generally in any of the final four months of this year.\n\nVisually the most striking was in February 2014 when the Somerset Levels hosted the largest lake in England, at 65sq km it was more than four times the size of the largest permanent inland body of water, Windermere.\n\nSmall wonder that climate change moved high up the political agenda. Climate emergencies were declared by councils across the Westcountry, and even one school (St Peter\u2019s Church of England Primary in Budleigh Salterton in East Devon).\n\nThe issue was pushed there by a growing band of activists and protesters, including the Extinction Rebellion movement.\n\n(Image: Penny Cross)\n\nProminent among them were young people, the most recognisable being the Swedish 16-year-old, Greta Thunberg, who became an honorary Plymothian when she headed to the city in August this year to hitch a ride across the Atlantic on a yacht to attend the United Nations climate change summit,\n\nHer year-long devotion to the cause, putting her education on hold, rather went against the grain of a decade characterised by an obsession with the self and typified by the selfie on the ubiquitous smartphone, and the rise of me-first populist politics.\n\nThis was the decade when many felt like turning away from the world, pulling on a comforting all-in-one garment, and hiding from politics, austerity and the weather.
