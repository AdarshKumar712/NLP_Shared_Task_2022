And if we act now, we could save lives in future not only in Zambia but regionally because our centre would cater for others in the region once complete, but it all depends on the government really,\u201d said Ambassador Mukwita.\n\nIn a statement made available to the Zambian Business Times \u2013 ZBT by press secretary Kellys Kaunda , the diplomat said times like now, of the COVID-19 epidemic raises the urgency for investing in diseases control such as cancer now more than ever because Zambia can ride on the international goodwill.\n\nThe Zambian envoy said that today might be COVID-19 and another time it could be another catastrophy hence investing in fighting cancer today could save lives tomorrow.\n\nHeinz Messinger, the Managing Director of AME International in Vienna is collaborating with the embassy of Zambia in Germany and anxious to see Zambia take advantage of the \u201cpromise\u201d for finance.\n\nAmbassador Mukwita said losing one life from cancer is bad but dozens annually is just unacceptable when something can be done to halt the loss.\n\nAnalysts however caution that interest free financing packages need critical review as they may have some hidden costs or restrictions in terms of equipment to be purchased. Zambia has to ensure that upgrades are made based on needs analysis as opposed to availability of interest free financing.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Author", "Gladys Lwizi"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 5.4.7.3 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface."}, "canonical_link": "https://zambianbusinesstimes.com/austrian-firm-offers-to-finance-uth-cancer-centre-upgrade/"}
