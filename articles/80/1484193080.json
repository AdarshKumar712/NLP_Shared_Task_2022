According to Austin police officer Bino Cadenas, a woman posted photos of a bullet that came through the roof of her home on China Rose Drive just after midnight Wednesday. The woman said the bullet nearly hit her on her head while she was sitting on her sofa.\n\n\"Please, please ... don't shoot up in the air! It's irresponsible, illegal and dangerous,\" Cadenas wrote in a tweet Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThis wasn't the only illegal new year's celebration to cause destruction in Austin. Illegal fireworks use caused an apartment complex fire in the Mueller area that has displaced 16 people. The Austin Fire Department said the fire caused $450,000 worth of damage but, thankfully, no one was hurt.\n\nWATCH: Illegal use of fireworks sets off Austin apartment complex fire\n\nCelebratory gunfire led to a woman's death in Harris County just after midnight Wednesday.
