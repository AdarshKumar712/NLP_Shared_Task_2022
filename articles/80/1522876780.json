The Allegan County Sheriff's Office, Michigan State Police, a Department of Natural Resources officer and the Lee Township Fire Department responded to the call.\n\nThe Allegan County Sheriff's Office Casco Township deputy, who is also on the county's dive/rescue team, arrived on the scene to find two males in the water and a third male using a small boat to attempt to rescue the men in the water.\n\nThe deputy and a state trooper were able to get one of the fishers on shore after he got on top of the ice. They threw a rescue line to the other male. Once the second fisher was out of the water and onto thin ice, police instructed the man to flatten out and roll toward shore until they were able to pull him to safety.\n\nIn total, the men were in the water about 20-30 minutes.\n\nThe brothers, who are 62 and 60 years old, are longtime residents of Lower Scott Lake and have nearly 30 years of ice fishing experience. Neither of them, however, had any safety gear with them. Both brothers showed signs of hypothermia and small cuts from the ice, but they declined to go to the hospital.\n\nThe Allegan County Sheriff\u2019s Department was also assisted at the scene by Fennville AMR and Clyde Township Fire Department. The sheriff's office is reminding everyone that \"no ice is safe ice,\" according to Lt. Brett Ensfield. The sheriff's office asks anyone going onto a frozen lake or pond to abide by these safety precautions:\n\nTell someone where you are going and when you should return.Bring proper safety gear, including a Personal Flotation Device (life jacket), ice picks, and a whistle.Do not walk out on less than four inches of clear ice.
