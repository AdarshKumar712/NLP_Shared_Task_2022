And by ending the unrivalled position of marriage we have helped to create the space for deeper discussions about giving legal recognition to other types of personal and caring relationships, such as those between friends, siblings and co-parents.\u201d\n\nQuick guide Explainer: civil partnerships Show Hide Civil partnerships were created in 2004 as a means of allowing same-sex couples to enter into a union that guarantees them similar legal rights to those who are married. They are limited to same-sex couples but in October 2018, following a supreme court ruling declaring the existing position discriminatory, the government announced that heterosexual couples would also be entitled to enter the arrangement. There are differences between the two forms of union, partially symbolic and partially matters of substance. For a marriage, the ceremony is solemnised by the couple saying a prescribed form of words; in a civil partnership, the couple can simply sign a document. Marriages can be conducted through either a civil or religious ceremony, at a registry office, church or wherever a venue is licensed. Civil partnerships are secular events, although partners can choose to hold a religious ceremony on the day. Civil partners cannot declare, for legal purposes, that they are married. Civil partnership certificates include the names of both parents of the parties whereas marriage certificates in England and Wales include only the names of a couple's fathers \u2013 for the time being. In terms of annulment the rules are virtually identical, although the clause that permits a marriage to be dissolved if one partner is 'suffering from a venereal disease in a communicable form' does not apply to civil partnerships. Likewise, adultery can be grounds for a married couple to divorce though it cannot be relied upon to end a civil partnership.\n\nThose in civil partnerships and those who are married enjoy the same tax breaks and benefits \u2013 such as the marriage allowance and bereavement payments. Surviving civil partners are treated the same as widows or widowers in terms of rights to state pension.\n\nWhile those who are married and in civil partnerships enjoy extensive legal rights, those who are merely cohabiting \u2013 3.3 million couples at the last estimate \u2013 have no legal protections or property rights if one of them dies.\n\nThe couple were joined for the registration by their two children, Eden, four, and Ariel, two, and their parents and friends who acted as witnesses.\n\nKeidan said: \u201cThrough this long journey and hard-fought battle, our mental health has suffered, our ability to be civil to each other has been tested, and, crucially, we missed out on that important moment to state clearly what we mean to each other \u2013 not just what we\u2019ve become in the eyes of others.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re grateful to, and wish to thank, everyone who has supported us on this journey so that we could finally do that in private a few moments ago.\u201d\n\nThose involved in the couple\u2019s campaign said that they were aware of as many as 80 other civil partnership ceremonies happening on Tuesday around the country. The first took place in Carmarthenshire, where a register office opened at 00:02am on New Year\u2019s Eve for Jake Rayson and Emma Wilson.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Civil partnerships", "UK news", "Marriage", "Family"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ben Quinn"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan \u2018formalise relationship\u2019 in London registry office", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/fee5e2d638d1c35f6d501fa397e53329/152x152.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan \u2018formalise relationship\u2019 in London registry office", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Ben Quinn", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf60342115f3453f6630a3a441229b7329d52943/0_335_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d4fae2ddadba2ee712f2dd59b5d47d54", "keywords": "Civil partnerships,UK news,Marriage,Family", "news_keywords": "Civil partnerships,UK news,Marriage,Family", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/31/couple-who-won-battle-to-open-up-civil-unions-register-partnership", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf60342115f3453f6630a3a441229b7329d52943/0_335_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=40e2c5b389827e0ece9b4f3cfee97e39", "description": "Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan \u2018formalise relationship\u2019 in London registry office", "type": "article", "title": "Couple who won battle to open up civil unions register partnership", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benquinn", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "UK news", "published_time": "2019-12-31T12:27:01.000Z", "tag": "Civil partnerships,UK news,Marriage,Family", "modified_time": "2019-12-31T12:58:58.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2019/dec/31/couple-who-won-battle-to-open-up-civil-unions-register-partnership?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2019/dec/31/couple-who-won-battle-to-open-up-civil-unions-register-partnership?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/31/couple-who-won-battle-to-open-up-civil-unions-register-partnership", "iphone": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2019/dec/31/couple-who-won-battle-to-open-up-civil-unions-register-partnership?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf60342115f3453f6630a3a441229b7329d52943/0_335_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=33154ff43c89991e9828e1564f4cb96c", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@BenQuinn75", "dnt": "on"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/31/couple-who-won-battle-to-open-up-civil-unions-register-partnership"}
