(AP) \u2014 A Louisiana mom and son who were devoted fans of Louisiana State University and were on their way to see the school\u2019s football team in the Peach Bowl when they died in a plane crash, will be laid to rest Thursday.\n\nGretchen D. Vincent, 51; her son Michael Walker Vincent, 15; were on a plane that crashed shortly after takeoff Saturday, killing five of the six people on board.\n\nMost of the five people on the plane who died had connections to a Lafayette-based technology firm, Global Data Systems. Gretchen D. Vincent\u2019s husband, Chris Vincent, is the president of Global Data Systems. Ian E. Biggs, 51, was a pilot and aircraft manager for GDS. Robert Vaughn Crisp II, 59 was vice president of business development and field services for the firm. The sole surviving passenger, Stephen Wade Berzas, 37, also worked for the company as its vice president of sales and marketing. Carley McCord, 30, was also a passenger on the plane and died in the crash. She was a well-known sports reporter and the daughter-in-law of the LSU offensive coordinator, Steve Ensminger.\n\nThe Vincents will be remembered at a visitation and funeral service at Our Savior\u2019s Church in Lafayette, Louisiana. In a nod to the duo\u2019s love of the LSU Tigers, guests are being asked to dress in the school\u2019s purple and gold colors.\n\nGretchen was described in an obituary as a woman with a \u201cmagnetic personality, a contagious laugh, and a radiant smile.\u201d She was active in various community activities such as the Junior League of Lafayette and the Ascension Episcopal Church where her son was a student. She hosted weekly Bible studies at her house. The Louisiana native had a special place in her heart for her alma mater of LSU and especially its sports teams. She was a season ticket holder for LSU football for most of her life, the obituary said. And she often traveled to LSU sporting events.\n\nHer son Michael Walker Vincent shared her love of all things purple and gold, according to his obituary. The teenager was an excellent student and planned to major in pre-dentistry at LSU as part of his plans to become an orthodontist. He had also dreamed of becoming a pilot and enjoyed going hunting and fishing in Louisiana, the obituary said. He died one day before his 16th birthday.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Associated Press.
