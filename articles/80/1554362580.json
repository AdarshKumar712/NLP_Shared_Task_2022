Reported illnesses range from very mild to severe, including death. Scientists and medical experts anticipate widespread transmission will occur in the U.S. in coming months and recommend social distancing, among other measures, to slow the spread. Call your doctor and stay home if you are sick. Get more information at CDC.gov/coronavirus or call the Tennessee Department of Health coronavirus information line at 877-857-2945 from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. EDT daily. Knox News is making this coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers, including nonsubscribers, to help people stay safe.\n\nSchools, businesses and restaurants across the country have cut hours or closed entirely for deep cleaning amid the spread of COVID-19. However, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the coronavirus can live on surfaces and in the air for hours, sometimes days.\n\nThe virus spreads between people who are in close contact with one another through infected droplets, much like the common cold or flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nScientists from the CDC, National Institutes of Health, Princeton and UCLA sprayed an aerosol that mimicked the microscopic droplets created when an infected person coughs or sneezes onto surfaces including plastic, stainless steel, cardboard and copper to represent a variety of household and hospital settings.\n\nNewsletter: Stay safe and informed with updates on the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nHow long the coronavirus can be infectious in an experimental setting\n\nPlastic: 3 days\n\nStainless steel: 3 days\n\nThe coronavirus can live on polypropylene, a type of plastic used in everything from Tupperware to toys, and stainless steel for up to three days. Although the CDC has only reported person-to-person transmission of COVID-19, study leader Neeltje van Doremalen at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told the Associated Press that \"it\u2019s theoretically possible\" that someone can get sick by touching contaminated surfaces.\n\nCardboard: 1 day\n\nThe COVID-19 virus can be infectious on cardboard for 24 hours. The CDC has said that it is unlikely that the coronavirus can be transmitted from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks \"because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces.\" Experts say you don't need to be worried about being exposed to coronavirus on boxes delivered by Amazon or on your takeout food bag.\n\nCopper: 4 hours\n\nThe coronavirus can sit on copper surfaces for up to four hours. The virus can live on coins made of copper, like pennies, more often than cash. Rachel Graham, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, told Business Insider that \"this shouldn't be a huge concern.\"\n\nAir: 3 hours\n\nThe findings of this study show that the virus can linger in the air for about three hours. Close contact with people infected with COVID-19 can transmit the virus through respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. This is the most common way to spread the coronavirus.\n\nHow to clean surfaces with coronavirus\n\nPreventative methods like cleaning and disinfecting surfaces often helps slow the spread of COVID-19. The CDC recommends putting on disposable gloves before touching anything that could have the virus on it.\n\nFirst, you should clean the surface with soap and water before disinfecting. Then, use a diluted household bleach solution, an alcohol solution with at least 70% alcohol or an EPA-registered household disinfectant to rid the surface of germs.\n\nWhen you're done, immediately throw away the gloves. Do not touch your face or any other surface. Last, wash your hands to make sure that no harmful bacteria are left.\n\nEmail Allie Clouse at aclouse@gannett.com and follow her on Twitter @allie_clouse.
