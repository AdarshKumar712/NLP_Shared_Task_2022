This zany event features people-powered privies fashioned in bizarre and humorous themes, skidding across the lake-top ice, or on packed snow. Whether the races feature a giant Star Wars creature, a sleek Batmobile replica with a toilet seat, or there\u2019s a bride in her wedding gown careening in an outhouse on skis, the race has never failed to amuse spectators.\n\nPeople attending the carnival can witness their dog compete in a canine talent contest, sing at an open mic session, gather around a bonfire on the beach, or gaze at fireworks \u2014 There\u2019s an array of family-oriented activities planned for this weekend at the Lake George Winter Carnival.\n\nMost all the activities are centered around Shepard Park beach. Saturday\u2019s events start off with opening ceremonies at noon at MacDonald Pier, followed by a chili cook-off in the Shepard Park amphitheater featuring cuisine prepared by local chefs.\n\nThe wacky outhouse races start at 1 p.m. at the Charles Wood Park Festival Commons off West Brook Road due to lack ice not forming soon enough. Registration is held at The Lagoon starting at 10 a.m.; call (518) 685-5009 for details.\n\nBeginning at 1:45 p.m., people will be gathering around bonfires on Shepard Park Beach and making s\u2019mores as they enjoy hot chocolate.\n\nFrom 1:45 p.m. to 3:45 p.m., people are welcome to make their own tie-dyed T-shirts in the snow.\n\nFollowing at 4 p.m. is the annual winter carnival parade down Canada St., and a large number of floats and attractions are participating this year.

Then from 12:30 p.m. to 2 p.m. on Sunday, people will be showing off their talents \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 in the karaoke/open mic event in Shepard Park, and all are welcome to perform.\n\nFollowing at 2 p.m. is another top draw, for folks seeking to impress their dates \u2014 a keg toss on the beach. Sign-up is from 1:30 p.m. to 1:45 p.m. at the souvenir tent. All ages are welcome to test their strength.\n\nOn both Saturday and Sunday, a variety of activities will be held through daylight hours.

Those participating are urged to bring a towel and dry clothes.\n\nThroughout each day, people will be warming up at bonfires and socializing, while other folks will be taking horse-drawn carriage and sleigh rides for a fee. Call Tina Purdy at (518) 321-5539 for details.\n\nLake George Winter Carnival co-chairman Lou Tokos said this week that more and more families are participating in the carnival each year.\n\n\u201cMost people have \u2018cabin fever\u2019 by February, and our carnival prompts people to get outdoors and enjoy fun activities,\u201d he said. \u201cConsidering all our family-friendly events which are free, we\u2019re definitely unique.\u201d \u25a0", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Thom Randall", "bizarre", "The Lagoon", "Festival Commons", "FUN", "MacDonald Pier", "toilet
