But it was too late for many of his relatives who had come home to grieve and bury him.\n\n\u201cMy brother got murdered. If in two weeks\u2019 time we were able to bury him, at least we would know he isn\u2019t just lying in a freezer somewhere. He would have been buried and gone and we could have started to rebuild instead of having to now go through the process of burying him,\u201d said the upset brother.\n\n\u201cNo one has ever issued an apology explaining the reason why it happened. The thing about it is that it happened on a day like November 30th, which we believed, would be memorable in people\u2019s minds.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI had family that came in and spent two weeks and had to get back to work and they will have to miss the funeral. For Christmas we did nothing. Even my family members overseas did not hang up lights or give gifts or celebrated Christmas as they used to before,\u201d Hollist said dejectedly.\n\nOn November 30th, Cecil Webb, 49, of Lower Walkers; Terry Small, a man in his late forties, of Walkers; and Lennox Browne, 48, of Walkers, all in St Andrew were killed in a bloody dispute reportedly over land.\n\nWhen Hollist spoke to Barbados\n\nTODAY on Monday, he indicated the bodies of the two other men were also released on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI am not just speaking on the behalf of my family but on behalf of all the families. I know in Barbados many people let things happen and they don\u2019t seem to have the guts or the balls to speak out but that is why things are always like this. We let people do things and get away with it. That is why I speak on behalf of all of the families because I know they also have to be frustrated,\u201d he said.\n\nEfforts to reach the Coroner\u2019s office as well as Attorney General Dale Marshall for an explanation were unsuccessful.\n\nBut according to Hollist, the process may have taken even longer had he not contacted someone who assisted in having the procedure \u201cfast-tracked\u201d. He said he was informed that a pathologist had to come from \u201cone of the islands\u201d to conduct the autopsies.\n\n\u201cUsually autopsies don\u2019t happen on Saturdays but we had to let them know that the family really needed to get some closure and it is taking too long for a body to be there,\u201d he complained, while adding that the sting of his brother\u2019s death still lingered.\n\n\u201cWith my family, it is hard, because I buried my dad on the 6th of November and then this tragic incident was really too close because I had not even gotten over my father.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t sit down and study these things but there are constantly on your mind. You\u2019re out there crying, you\u2019re driving and you have to pull over and you\u2019re in the grocery store and tears come. It\u2019s really hard,\u201d he said.\n\n[email protected]", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Kareem Smith"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A month after the news of a triple murder rocked Barbados, the victims\u2019 bodies are still to be buried and at least one family member wants to know why it took so long for autopsies to be performed.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cropped-logo-150x150.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1386333611", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.luovalabs.barbadostodaymobile", "google-site-verification": "tv6HaZJva6u6f8lwfpLqmQ5hBqYUg7fqvhonjYsxXzo", "description": "A month after the news of a triple murder rocked Barbados, the victims\u2019 bodies are still to be buried and at least one family member wants to know why it took so long for autopsies to be performed.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "No burial yet for triple murder victims - Barbados Today", "description": "A month after the news of a triple murder rocked Barbados, the victims\u2019 bodies are still to be buried and at least one family member wants to know why it took so long for autopsies to be performed.", "url": "https://barbadostoday.bb/2019/12/31/no-burial-yet-for-triple-murder-victims/", "site_name": "Barbados Today", "image": {"identifier": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Scene.jpg", "secure_url": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Scene.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 800}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BarbadosToday/", "section": "Crime", "published_time": "2020-01-01T03:25:19+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A month after the news of a triple murder rocked Barbados, the victims\u2019 bodies are still to be buried and at least one family member wants to know why it took so long for autopsies to be performed.", "title": "No burial yet for triple murder victims - Barbados Today", "site": "@barbadostoday", "image": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Scene.jpg", "creator": "@barbadostoday"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 1.0.1", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cropped-logo-500x500.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://barbadostoday.bb/2019/12/31/no-burial-yet-for-triple-murder-victims/"}
