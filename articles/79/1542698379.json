Moscow supports President Bashar al-Assad and Ankara backs some opposition groups.\n\nThe deal reached in Moscow also established a security corridor on each side of Idlib\u2019s key east-west M4 highway. The corridor stretches 6km (3.7 miles] to the north and 6km to the south of the highway.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera News", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Russia and Turkey have agreed on a military ceasefire in Syria\u2019s Idlib province.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/mritems/assets/images/touch-icon-iphone.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0 maximum-scale=1.0, minimal-ui", "guid": 200309083037719, "title": "Russia and Turkey agree on Idlib ceasefire", "description": "Russia and Turkey have agreed on a military ceasefire in Syria\u2019s Idlib province.", "og": {"title": "Russia and Turkey agree on Idlib ceasefire", "description": "Russia and Turkey have agreed on a military ceasefire in Syria\u2019s Idlib province.", "internalurl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/newsfeed/2020/03/russia-turkey-agree-idlib-ceasefire-200309083037719.html", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/newsfeed/2020/03/russia-turkey-agree-idlib-ceasefire-200309083037719.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/3/9/803910dd649c49eaa74be45392172e38_18.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 562}}, "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/newsfeed/2020/03/russia-turkey-agree-idlib-ceasefire-200309083037719.html", "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/3/9/803910dd649c49eaa74be45392172e38_18.jpg", "ShortURL": "https://aje.io/p4fz5", "twitter": {"title": "Russia and Turkey agree on Idlib ceasefire", "description": "Russia and Turkey have agreed on a military ceasefire in Syria\u2019s Idlib province.", "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/3/9/803910dd649c49eaa74be45392172e38_18.jpg", "account_id": 4970411, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@AJEnglish"}, "ContentType": "Programs", "news_keywords": "Syria's War, Turkey-Syria border, Middle East, Russia, Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Vladimir Putin, Humanitarian crises", "ContentIndexURL": "/programmes/", "google-play-app": "app-id=net.aljazeera.english", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504847776"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/newsfeed/2020/03/russia-turkey-agree-idlib-ceasefire-200309083037719.html"}
