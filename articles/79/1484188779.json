The liturgy celebrated the neighborhood\u2019s commitment to the Mummers tradition, while marking the vigil of the Solemnity of Mary, the Mother of God.\n\n\u201cJesus believed in fun,\u201d said pastor and celebrant Father Francis Cauterrucci, who delivered his homily while wearing a sequined eye mask. \u201cWe gather in joyful celebration because we believe in one another.\u201d\n\nAccording to various estimates, some 10,000 participants typically perform in the Philadelphia parade, which ranks as the nation\u2019s oldest of its kind. The event draws hundreds of thousands of spectators in person and via television.\n\nThe city began formally sponsoring the parade in 1901, but the Mummers\u2019 roots extend back to ancient and medieval traditions. Locally, the practice of dressing in costume and acting out short skits during the holidays grew with the influx of European immigrants into Philadelphia. Such performances have historically relied on humor and satire: the word \u201cmummer\u201d itself derives from medieval French and English words for \u201cmask\u201d and \u201cmutter,\u201d and may also be related to the name of the Greek god of ridicule, Momus. Political and cultural references shape many of the performances at Philadelphia\u2019s parade.\n\nThe five divisions of the city\u2019s Mummer clubs \u2013 comic, fancy, wench brigade, string band and fancy brigade \u2013 were highlighted at the Dec. 31 Mass, which was preceded by a presentation of iconic items from each group. After a prelude by the Mummers Chorus, a stylized umbrella, a set of golden slippers, a banjo, trophies and two Mummers dolls were placed on a table in the sanctuary.\n\nOne of the dolls was dedicated to the late Father Thomas Wassel, a former pastor of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and a Mummers chaplain.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s mummery tradition has deep roots in South Philadelphia\u2019s European immigrant communities and in their Catholic faith, according to the Mummers Museum.\n\nFor Fran Kelly, the Mummers Mass affirms that sense of constancy.\n\n\u201cWe have the same routine each year at the Mass, including recognizing our deceased members,\u201d said Kelly, a member of the Satin Slipper Fancy Brigade.\n\nThe Mass also offsets the intense competition among the clubs, he added.\n\n\u201cIt brings us all together,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe\u2019re friends now and we love each other, but tomorrow, everybody\u2019s out to win.\u201d\n\nMany families have made the Mass part of their New Year\u2019s Eve tradition. Parishioner Noreen Brennan, who has attended the liturgy for the past three decades, brought her eight-month-old granddaughter Marlee to the Dec. 31 celebration.\n\n\u201cIt starts off the year well, and we\u2019re keeping the tradition alive,\u201d said Brennan, whose family members perform in both the fancy and wench divisions.\n\nFellow parishioner Stosh Visack was joined at the Mass by his son Chase, who flew in from his U.S. Navy assignment in Pearl Harbor to attend the New Year\u2019s festivities. For both father and son, the liturgy is mandatory preparation for their big day on Broad Street.\n\n\u201cThis is our blessing for tomorrow, so we all stay safe and have a good time,\u201d said the elder Visack, a member of the Riverfront Mummers Wench Brigade. \u201cBut first and foremost, we praise the Lord for the New Year and its blessings, and we thank God for everything that went well over the past year.\u201d\n\nVisack added that he wasn\u2019t too worried about the \u201cintricate details\u201d of his brigade\u2019s choreography.\n\n\u201cWe just go right to the heart of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever comes out, comes out.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly the creative freedom that the parade and, more fundamentally, Christ\u2019s salvation brings, said Father Cauterrucci in his homily.\n\n\u201cWe celebrate the great and particular gifts given to us by God,\u201d he said. \u201cCelebrate the parade, celebrate the people who are in the parade, and celebrate this gift of life that we share together in the church.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Father Francis Cauterrucci", "Mummers", "Mummers Mass", "new year's day", "Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish", "Philadelphia Mummers Parade", "South Philadelphia Catholic churches"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Gina Christian", "Posted January"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Father Francis Cauterrucci, Mummers, Mummers Mass, new year's day, Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish, Philadelphia Mummers Parade, South Philadelphia Catholic churches", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "fb": {"pages": 108085326801}, "google-site-verification": "A8iklSxbt_qyO7YOXnA75o6KISmvf7AgYpV403xWCDI", "robots": "index,follow", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"title": "Blessed for Broad Street at the Mummers Mass", "description": "The Dec. 31 liturgy at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish in South Philadelphia drew hundreds together for a celebration of faith, family and fun.", "type": "article", "url": "https://catholicphilly.com/2020/01/news/local-news/blessed-for-broad-street-at-the-mummers-mass/", "site_name": "Catholic Philly", "image": "https://catholicphilly.com/media-files/2020/01/Mummers-Mass-1-796x597.jpeg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CatholicPhilly", "title": "Blessed for Broad Street at the Mummers Mass", "description": "The Dec. 31 liturgy at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish in South Philadelphia drew hundreds together for a celebration of faith, family and fun.", "image": "https://catholicphilly.com/media-files/2020/01/Mummers-Mass-1-796x597.jpeg"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://catholicphilly.com/media-files/2016/05/cropped-cplogo-fav-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://catholicphilly.com/2020/01/news/local-news/blessed-for-broad-street-at-the-mummers-mass/"}
