The person might prefer to use \u2018they\u2019 pronouns instead of he/she. Somridho prefers he/his.\n\nWhen he grew up in India, which he left as a 15-year-old, he was mocked for being \u2018gentle and soft\u2019.\n\nHe also came out as gay which his family is totally accepting of but at the time same-sex marriage was illegal in the country.\n\n\u2018Acceptance for the LGBTQIA+ community was just low,\u2019 Somridho explains to Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018Even now it is still relatively hard to be gay in India as compared to being gay in London. I felt free when I moved there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe adds: \u2018I could finally start expressing myself the way I wanted to. The first thing that I did when I moved to the UK was buy myself a nose ring and some nail paint, obviously!\u2019\n\nThough being gay and gender-fluid may have been considered unconventional in a traditional Indian family, Somridho\u2019s parents never made him feel like an outsider.\n\nHe recalls one occasion where his dad called him up to congratulate him on one of the bold photoshoots Somridho regularly takes part in, as we works as a model on the side.\n\nAnd while his parents still live in Delhi, Somridho manages to chat to them every day and go back home every six months.\n\nAs a gay, gender-fluid person who grew up in India, he\u2019s had some tough times (Picture: Tshiella D)\n\n\u2018I love my parents. They are very supportive,\u2019 he tells Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018They love me to pieces. It, of course, took them a while to get to this stage.\n\n\u2018When I first told them I am gay (2016), they were quite shocked, a bit upset even. However, now they have reached a stage where they are really accepting.\n\n\u2018I guess they love me so much that they just want me to be happy. And expressing myself in an androgynous manner makes me the happiest.\u2019\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that growing up as gay was any easier for Somridho.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Somridho appreciates that India is changing its attitudes towards the LGBTQ community, in his adolescence it was difficult.\n\n\u2018I love our culture and our traditions. It is a beautiful country, really diverse. But my experience with being gay, that was quite different.\n\n\u2018Growing up, I had to pretend to have crushes on girls around my friends to feel accepted by them.\n\n\u2018Right from a very young age, it is instilled in us that being feminine if you are a guy is wrong. My uncles and aunts would make fun of me for being too gentle and soft.\n\n\u2018Obviously, they thought it was no big deal and they did not really mean to hurt me but it actually did hurt me. You see, casual homophobia is very common in India.\u2019\n\nHe came to London at 15 where he\u2019s also had some tough times (Picture: Somridho Dasgupta)\n\nSomridho thinks that the Asian community is a little slower at accepting but is hopeful that attitudes are changing.\n\n\u2018In our (Indian) culture, a lot of emphasis is placed on masculinity,\u2019 he explains.\n\n\u2018A man is expected to follow the traditional ideals of masculinity. Hence, when somebody does something that does not fit those ideals, everybody is shocked.\n\n\u2018Progress has been made, of course. But there still is a long way to go.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say the UK is an LGBTQ haven for Somridho. He\u2019s had his fair share of intolerant attitudes here too.\n\n\u2018I still face hate. I often get things thrown at me from moving cars. People scream slurs at me.\n\n\u2018Even now, androgynous or gender-fluid people are too scared to express themselves, scared of the opposition they would face. Every year, numerous LGBTQIA+ people die in London as a result of hate crime.\n\n\u2018But, did this stop me from expressing myself? No. I still walk out in public in my white fur trousers, my pearl covered glasses and my chunky earrings. I like to get a conversation going as language has power.\n\n\u2018Good or bad, as long as people are talking about it, it is a victory for me because more people get to know about me, my style. They get to know that perhaps, they don\u2019t have to be a man or a woman either.\n\n\u2018They can be anything they want to be.\u2019\n\nMORE: From dresses made of meat to androgynous art \u2013 the best red carpet looks of the decade\n\nMORE: The problem with calling the new androgynous emojis \u2018non-binary\u2019\n\nMORE: In 2020, let\u2019s end the needless hostility towards trans people\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Men", "Gender", "India"], "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Somriddho Dasgupta's style - inspired by RuPaul's Drag Race - is bold, androgynous and gender fluid.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/m-icon-black.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "google-site-verification": "NRfCb8mBNAy5_f17NpvLZYoY38EzM2dgpcOh_Am9yps", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/somridho.png?crop=0px%2C23px%2C1200px%2C631px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "title": "Androgynous and gender-fluid Indian teenager fights for cultural acceptance", "description": "'On some days I would feel more masculine than feminine.
