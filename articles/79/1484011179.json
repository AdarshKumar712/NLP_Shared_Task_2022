The measure was brought in by the Coalition Avenir Quebec government earlier this fall, fulfilling an election promise to raise the age limit from 18 with a stated goal of keeping marijuana away from youth.\n\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content But public policy and public health experts have said the vast majority of younger users will likely continue to consume cannabis, and they may end up going to illegal sources to obtain the product. The federal law sets the minimum age at 18 but leaves it open to provinces and territories to establish their own rules. The legal age for consumption is 19 in every other province except Alberta, where it\u2019s 18. \u2014 Also this \u2026 REGINA \u2014 Saskatchewan\u2019s growing microdistillery industry is making some one-of-a-kind, home-grown beverages.

Meredith and Colin Schmidt work with local producers which supply the ingredients. So does Black Fox Farm and Distillery near Saskatoon.\n\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Former grain farmer John Cote says he and his wife wanted to show the world that they could make the best gin and whisky right in Saskatchewan.

The Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority says they produced about half-a-million litres of spirits in 2018. \u2014 ICYMI (in case you missed it) \u2026 VANCOUVER \u2014 The British Columbia government and a former social worker in Kelowna, B.C., are facing a new civil lawsuit by a former child in care who accuses the social worker of stealing her money to pay off his mortgage and other personal expenses. The allegation is just one of a string of accusations in the legal action by the one-time foster child, who details a series of failures by the authorities charged with her care, forcing her into homelessness and exposing her to sexual exploitation.\n\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The woman, who is now 19 and living in Vancouver, cannot be named as a former child in care. Documents filed with the B.C. Supreme Court on Dec. 20 allege she was apprehended from her mother at age three, placed in a series of unsafe and abusive homes and then had her own two children apprehended. The statement of claim says the failure of the social worker, Robert Riley Saunders, and other provincial officials to respond to the risks and harms she faced in a timely way was \u201creprehensible and outrageous.\u201d None of the allegations have been proven in court. Saunders could not be reached for comment and the ministry declined to comment as the matter is before the court. \u2014 What we are watching in the U.S. \u2026 WHITE SETTLEMENT, Texas \u2014 A firearms instructor and reserve sheriff\u2019s deputy is being credited with protecting a Texas congregation from a gunman who opened fire during Sunday services.\n\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Jack Wilson fired a single shot at the assailant who attacked the West Freeway Church of Christin the Fort Worth-area town of White Settlement.
