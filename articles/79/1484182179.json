Moeahu is already a leader. It is likely his influence in Taranaki will only grow.\n\nThis is why he is the Taranaki Daily News Person of the Year.\n\nIt is never easy choosing a winner for this award.\n\nInevitably the award could successfully be invested in any of the five nominees. The achievements may be different but invariably they are equivalent in a number of ways.\n\nSIMON O'CONNOR/STUFF Suzanne Porter's work with the Taranaki Arts Festival Trust has largely defined Taranaki's cultural landscape for the first two decades of the new millenia.\n\nFor sheer impact on Taranaki it is hard to find someone who has had a greater influence than Suzanne Porter. In recognising her as the 2019 runner-up we acknowledge her role in building the Taranaki Arts Festival Trust into a festival powerhouse that has largely defined Taranaki's modern cultural landscape.\n\nOne festival - Womad - rises above all others. Since the international event was first held in Taranaki in 2007 it has grown to an annual celebration of all that Taranaki can be.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the people who attend Womad come from outside Taranaki and almost all can't say enough about how much they rate the experience.\n\nIt is what differentiates us from other provincial centres. It makes us - as corny as it sounds - just a little bit special.\n\nPorter has a team that helps her run that festival. She would be the first to acknowledge that. But ultimately the success of Womad is a reflection of her leadership. We thank her for it. She has changed Taranaki for the better.\n\nANDY JACKSON/STUFF Sasha Finer is a Taranaki story teller who speaks our language.\n\nWriter Sasha Finer has a promising future and is a talent to watch. Writing is not an easy business. The hours are long, the workplace is solitary and the money is pitiful. But it is an art the writer and the audience they write for cannot do without.\n\nWe wish Finer all the best in pursuing her career, whatever it involves, but we hope it involves more stories. Her words of Taranaki are precious because they talk about who we are.\n\nSIMON O'CONNOR/STUFF Paul Rangiwahia is helping bring conversations about mental health out of the shadows.\n\nPaul Rangiwahia's message is ours too. He has taken his vulnerabilities, the lowest point in his life, and turned it into an experience we can all learn and grow with.\n\nMental health still has a long road to travel before it is free of stigma. But Rangiwahia is driving us along that road and demonstrating how much better life can be if we acknowledge our true selves and are courageous enough to be honest with each other.\n\nSIMON O'CONNOR/STUFF Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens is on track for a huge career in rugby.\n\nJacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens has stayed true to himself for years. The teenager set a goal to be a professional rugby player early and then worked toward it. That he was given entry into the upper echelon of the game straight out of high school speaks to his focus and commitment to be the best he can.\n\nLike all nominees, he is an inspiration.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Matt Rilkoff"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "They are what inspires us.
