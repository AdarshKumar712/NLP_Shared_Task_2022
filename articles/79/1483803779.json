The video with his remarks was later shared by Russian international network RT.\n\nUS-based MSNBC host and correspondent Joy Reid came under increased scrutiny this Tuesday after slamming US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for allegedly appearing on Russian TV network RT. In a now-deleted post, Reid retweeted a video with the RT logo of Pompeo speaking at Texas A&M University in April 2019 about his work at the CIA. Just like the user, who originally shared the clip, the TV host suggested that the US secretary of state had made the remarks while being a guest on the Russian news channel.\n\nIn the video, that was previously shared by RT on its social media, Pompeo reflected on his work as the director of the CIA, while saying \u201cwe lied, we cheated, we stole\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe had entire training courses\u201d, the secretary of state said, when replying to a question about US foreign policy.\n\nPompeo: 'I was the CIA director. We lied, we cheated, we stole' [April 2019] pic.twitter.com/f94BfEYMCQ \u2014 RT (@RT_com) December 8, 2019\n\nReid seemed to believe that the remarks were made during Pompeo\u2019s supposed appearance on RT, which caused her vociferous reaction.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine what Republicans would have said if Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had gone on Russian State TV and said this during the Obama administration?\u201d Reid said in a now deleted tweet, as quoted by Fox News. \u201cNow? Republicans are unphased by this remarkably brazen Kremlin bowing. Putin really did win the year\n\nYet again, Joy Reid is blatantly lying and there will be no consequences at all because she works for MSNBC and is spreading lies to advance today's neo-McCarthyism.\n\n\n\nRT pulled a random clip of Pomepo's speech. In Reid's hands, this becomes: Pomepo \"has gone on Russian State TV.\" https://t.co/x3EN6D2Z4b \u2014 Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) December 31, 2019\n\nThe MSNBC host was rebuked for the error, which prompted Reid to later delete the tweet and clarify that Pompeo\u2019s comments were actually made in Texas. The correspondent, however, did not apologise for her mistake.\n\nThis actually was said in Texas and was posted by RT. Updating for my thread. https://t.co/61zHaiZTCZ \u2014 Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) December 31, 2019\n\nNetizens were shocked that Reid had managed to escape almost unscathed for such an egregious error, slamming the journalist for failing to do her homework before making bold statements.\n\nYou should get facts straight first and not spread misinformation \u2014 Ellen Stevens (@EllenSt92614455) December 31, 2019\n\nYou\u2019re a journalist, you have a responsibility to fact check information before making gut instinct reactions. You do not just damage your own credibility with such actions, but you are damaging modern journalism\u2019s credibility when journalism is more important than ever. \u2014 E. (@machiavelliauo) December 31, 2019\n\nSo just an \u201cupdate\u201d but no apology for spreading fake news?? You are pathetic! \u2014 maria (@maria62514863) January 1, 2020\n\nWhat happened to your tweet about Pompeo on Russia RT?? Did you right that???\n\nWhat a clown! You don't even rate a Fake News! You get the pure BS rating! \u2014 MTPhillips (@MTP_IOH54) December 31, 2019\n\n@JoyAnnReid lied about Pompeo like she often does about Trump but had to delete her tweet.... Stupid leftists are liars \u2014 W Johnson (@gymmratttt) January 1, 2020\n\nI dont think you lied with the Pompeo tweet you deleted. I think you're an idiot and actually believed it. If you had any integrity you would have apologized for it. \u2014 BigCat (@ImTheRealBarry) January 1, 2020\n\nReid also came under fire back in 2018 after making dubious claims that some of her old blog posts containing homophobic statements were a result of hacker attacks.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Joy Reid slams Pompeo", "Joy Reid suggest Pompeo appears on RT", "Reid slammed", "false comments", "Pompeo on CIA"], "tags": ["Joy Reid", "RT", "Russia", "United States", "MSNBC", "Mike Pompeo"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "In April 2019, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke at Texas A&M University about his experience as director of the CIA.
