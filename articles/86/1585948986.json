Antigens are substances in the body that trigger an immune response.\n\nThere will also be clinical trials in the United States \u201cupon regulatory approval, which is expected shortly,\u201d BioNTech announced.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to have completed pre-clinical studies in Germany and will soon initiate this first-in-human trial ahead of our expectations,\u201d BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said. \u201cThe speed with which we were able to move from the start of the program to trial initiation speaks to the high level of engagement from everyone involved.\u201d\n\nPaul-Ehrlich-Institut \u201cassumes that further clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates will start in Germany in the next few months,\u201d they said.\n\nJason Spinks\n\nThe Brussels Times", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Apr 22 17:01:47 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Germany has approved clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine, authorities announced\u00a0on Wednesday.
