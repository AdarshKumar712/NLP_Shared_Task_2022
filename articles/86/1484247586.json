(Representational Image) Police said that the accused was arrested accidentally by Haryana Police while he was trying to dispose of the half-burnt body of the couple\u2019s son who was missing since the sensational murders. (Representational Image)\n\nTwo days after a singer couple and their minor daughter were found murdered at their Punjabi colony residence in Shamli, their 30-year-old disciple was arrested from Panipat in Haryana in this connection on Wednesday.\n\nPolice said that the accused, identified as Himanshu Saini, was arrested accidentally by Haryana Police while he was trying to dispose of the half-burnt body of the couple\u2019s son Bhagwat (10) who was missing since the sensational murders.\n\n\u201cHimanshu is a disciple of victim Ajay Pathak (42) and used to perform with him for the last two-and-a-half years. During interrogation, he told the police that he had given Rs 60,000 to Ajay who was not only returning him the money, but also used to humiliate him in front of his family members whenever he asked for the sum. On Monday night, he stayed in their house and killed Ajay, his wife Sneha Pathak (36) and their daughter Vasundahra (14) with a sword, while he strangulated Bhagwat to death,\u201d said Shamli Superintendent of Police Vineet Jaiswal.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to take away the bodies in the couple\u2019s car, but could not carry out his plan single-handedly. So, he just bundled Bhagwat\u2019s body in the car and locked the house to give an impression that the family had left for Karnal in Haryana where Ajay was scheduled to perform at a bhajan sandhya Tuesday. He also took all the four mobile phones of the family members with himself,\u201d the SP pointed out, adding Haryana Police had handed him over to them.\n\nHe was produced in a local court in Shamli, which sent him to 14-day judicial custody on Wednesday.\n\nThe police added that Himanshu was in dire need of money as he was unable to repay a loan of Rs 5 lakh from a bank, which served him a legal notice in this connection.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["shamli", "shamli murder", "shamli singers murder", "family murdered in shamli", "up police", "up news"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Amit Sharma"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 05:16:31 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The police added that the accused was in dire need of money as he was unable to repay a loan of Rs 5 lakh from a bank, which served him a legal notice in this connection.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/10/fav-icon.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=990", "news_keywords": "shamli, shamli murder, shamli singers murder, family murdered in shamli, up police, up news", "keywords": "shamli, shamli murder, shamli singers murder, family murdered in shamli, up police, up news", "google-site-verification": "UzbS4ghT-l3F85eDiPbzEUeeKcvrnrGCgvsNHCRgvIc", "msvalidate.01": "CCA9DA5B985004F4462DA743E776C636", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "fb": {"pages": 215732349153100}, "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/2-days-after-murder-of-shamli-singers-family-disciple-held-6195478/?ia_markup=1"}, "description": "The police added that the accused was in dire need of money as he was unable to repay a loan of Rs 5 lakh from a bank, which served him a legal notice in this connection.", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/2-days-after-murder-of-shamli-singers-family-disciple-held-6195478/", "site_name": "The Indian Express", "locale": "en_US", "title": "2 days after murder of Shamli singers\u2019 family, disciple held", "description": "The police added that the accused was in dire need of money as he was unable to repay a loan of Rs 5 lakh from a bank, which served him a legal notice in this connection.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/12/handcuffs.jpg?w=759", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 759, "height": 422}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "The Indian Express", "creator": "@indianexpress", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/2-days-after-murder-of-shamli-singers-family-disciple-held-6195478/", "title": "2 days after murder of Shamli singers\u2019 family, disciple held", "description": "The police added that the accused was in dire need of money as he was unable to repay a loan of Rs 5 lakh from a bank, which served him a legal notice in this connection.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/12/handcuffs.jpg?w=759", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 759, "height": 422}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-02T05:16:31+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T05:16:31+05:30"}, "robots": "NOODP", "majestic-site-verification": "MJ12_ad7db024-a46c-482a-bb2f-e1ae09432a65", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/10/fav-icon.png?w=120"}, "canonical_link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/2-days-after-murder-of-shamli-singers-family-disciple-held-6195478/"}
