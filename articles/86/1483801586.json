These can retell single stories that captivated readers of the time, a saga that played out across many articles, and even stories that were crowded to the margins by other news at the time but have made a lasting impact on our region.\n\nWhere is the largest permanent food cart pod in Oregon?\n\nOf course, it has to be in Portland. The Rose City has been known for its food cart culture for years. Mobile eateries serve up street food for the masses, a fast and cheap alternative to a sit-down restaurant and a locally minded alternative to drive-through fast food. College students love food carts, office workers love food carts, late-night diners love food carts.\n\nWhere else could it be than Portland? No other city in Oregon comes close to Portland's size, and after all, Portland is well known for its walkable neighborhoods and eclectic dining scene. Portland is the home of Portland State University, the largest school in the state. Entire city blocks, even, are set aside in Portland for food carts.\n\nThe truth: Portland did have the largest food cart pod in Oregon, and probably the second-, third- and fourth-largest food cart pods, too. (We're not sure who keeps track of these things.) But that was before Feb. 2, 2018.\n\nBeaverton has been on a rapid redevelopment pace in its downtown area for years, thanks in large part to the urban renewal plan that city voters OK'd back in 2011. That downtown scene got a lot more downtown-ish in early 2018, as BG Food Cartel officially opened for business across Southwest Millikan Way from the Beaverton Building.\n\nBG Food Cartel has space for 31 food carts. That's a lot, but that's not all. The food cart pod also has an indoor-outdoor bar and public event space. There are green open spaces for children to run around or families to spread out a picnic blanket. There's even a fire pit.\n\nAs food cart pods are increasingly threatened by development in Portland, it was important to the people behind BG Food Cartel and city officials in Beaverton that the food cart pod not just camp out on a vacant lot, but have its own defined space. In sum, it's a purpose-built food cart pod, a place where food carts are intended to be and where they won't run the risk of suddenly having to find a new location because someone wants to build a parking garage there.\n\n\"BG\" isn't an abbreviation; instead, it is a clever nod to the family behind the food cart pod.\n\nThe Beaverton City Council officially gave the go-ahead for food carts to come to town in 2015. In 2016, the city held a competition in which it offered up to $25,000 to help create a food cart pod. Dana Biggi, granddaughter of the late Beaverton Foods founder Rose Biggi, submitted the winning bid.\n\nAs it happens, BG Food Cartel sits at the corner of Millikan Way and another street: Southwest Rose Biggi Avenue. The Biggi family has owned the property for years, and for years, it sat empty as the Beaverton Building and other developments sprung up on the other side of Millikan Way.\n\nBG Food Cartel didn't have a perfectly smooth opening season. On March 21, 2018, an explosion mangled one of the tenant food carts and sent a woman working inside to the hospital. Investigators said the blast appeared to be accidental, although the food cart pod was briefly closed as a precaution.\n\nCentral Beaverton has been increasingly promoted as a dining destination by Mayor Denny Doyle and other civic leaders. \"Restaurant Row\" features more and more places to dine and drink. An August 2019 headline in The Times declared, \"Beaverton has hope for restaurant renaissance,\" citing BG Food Cartel along with the proliferation of new restaurants as a sign of a changing downtown core.\n\nThe food cart pod itself remains an ever-popular lunch spot, including for city employees who work across the street.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["topics: Hospitality_Recreation", "socialTag: Food and drink", "Contents", "Articles", "Beaverton", "Oregon", "Portland metropolitan area", "Cart", "Food cart", "Portland", "Oregon", "Street food", "Beaverton", "Portland", "Maine", "Fast food", "entities: food cart culture", "Beaverton City Council", "Beaverton Building", "The Times", "Mayor", "Editor", "Beaverton Foods", "food cart pod", "Portland State University", "Rose Biggi", "tenant food carts", "Oregon", "Portland", "food cart pods", "food cart cluster", "Denny Doyle", "street food", "Portland State University", "Dana Biggi", "the The Times", "Restaurant Row", "food carts", "drive-through fast food", ""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Pamplin Media Group"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "2018: Central Beaverton gets Portland-style food cart cluster, Local Features, Beaverton, Aloha local Features, Breaking Features alerts for Beaverton, Aloha city.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "topics: Hospitality_Recreation, socialTag: Food and drink, Contents, Articles, Beaverton, Oregon, Portland metropolitan area, Cart, Food cart, Portland, Oregon, Street food, Beaverton, Portland, Maine, Fast food, entities: food cart culture, Beaverton City Council, Beaverton Building, The Times, Mayor, Editor, Beaverton Foods, food cart pod, Portland State University, Rose Biggi, tenant food carts, Oregon, Portland, food cart pods, food cart cluster, Denny Doyle, street food, Portland State University, Dana Biggi, the The Times, Restaurant Row, food carts, drive-through fast food,", "rights": "Pamplin Communications Corporation", "author": "Pamplin Media Group", "description": "2018: Central Beaverton gets Portland-style food cart cluster, Local Features, Beaverton, Aloha local Features, Breaking Features alerts for Beaverton, Aloha city.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "fb": {"app_id": 384172401695810}, "og": {"url": "https://pamplinmedia.com/bvt/17-features/446801-362897-2018-central-beaverton-gets-portland-style-food-cart-cluster", "type": "article", "title": "2018: Central Beaverton gets Portland-style food cart cluster", "image": "https://pamplinmedia.com/images/artimg/00003660211924-0712.jpg", "site_name": "https://joomlakave.com", "description": "The opening of BG Food Cartel is still a watershed moment in the downtown area's redevelopment."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ThePortlandTrib", "title": "2018: Central Beaverton gets Portland-style food cart cluster", "description": "The opening of BG Food Cartel is still a watershed moment in the downtown area's redevelopment.", "image": "https://pamplinmedia.com/images/artimg/00003660211924-0712.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://pamplinmedia.com/bvt/17-features/446801-362897-2018-central-beaverton-gets-portland-style-food-cart-cluster"}
