Attorneys for Lunden Alexis Roberts had urged the judge to find Biden in contempt of court at that hearing for not providing financial information for the past five years. \u201cOne of the clearest indicators of a judge\u2019s integrity is when he or she recuses from a case,\u201d said Clinton Lancaster, one of Roberts\u2019 attorneys. \u201cIt highlights the ethos and values that make the judiciary such a powerful, separate branch of government. Our client sincerely thanks Judge McSpadden for his time and attention to what has become a difficult and convoluted child support matter.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Mail reported that a \u2018defrauded investor\u2019 Joel Caplan filed a motion in Independence County, in an effort to become a part of Lunden Roberts\u2019 case.\n\nJoel Caplan claims he was swindled in a scheme known as the \u2018China Hustle\u2019 and Hunter Biden\u2019s bank records will show he was part of the scheme.\n\nCaplan told Judge Don McSpadden to \u2018follow the money\u2019 and in a 30-page filing, lays out how he was allegedly swindled out of 10 years of his life savings in a \u2018multi-billion dollar stock scheme known as the China Hustle.\u2019 Caplan, who filed papers from Jerusalem, Israel, claims many Chinese nationals made fortunes from the ploy, which involved presenting fake company documents and claiming they were genuine investments when they were actual frauds. Then the Chinese Nationals went on to use the ill-gotten gains to influence politics and even \u2018bribe\u2019 individuals, such as Biden, Caplan claims. Caplan points to Donald Trump\u2019s claim in October that Biden received a $1.5 billion payday from a China-based private equity fund. Biden has denied the claim, saying that he has not taken money from China. He said he bought into a Chinese investment fund after his father left office for $420,000. The $1.5 billion was the amount the fund aimed to raise in China for investments. Still, Caplan wants Biden\u2019s bank records in an apparently far-fetched attempt to trace back the billions of dollars that went missing in China, in his bid for \u2018justice\u2019 and to possibly regain his lost savings.\n\nPrivate investigator Dominic Casey also asked to be a part of the case and claimed he has obtained Biden\u2019s bank account records, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nThe judge in Hunter Biden\u2019s Arkansas paternity case has recused himself today, hours after an attempt to make the businessman\u2019s Ukraine dealings the center of the case, according to court documents obtained by DailyMail.com. Judge Don McSpadden, of Independence County, didn\u2019t give an explanation when he announced he was recusing himself at 10.20am. McSpadden\u2019s recusal came two hours after \u2018defrauded investor\u2019 Joel Caplan, who wants to be made a party in the case, filed a witness statement from ex-Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin. Shokin claimed he was fired in 2016 because he was leading an investigation into Burisma and refused to shut it down, despite pressure from Hunter\u2019s father, then-VP Joe Biden.\n\nthegatewaypundit.com/2019/12/breaking-judge-in-hunter-bidens-paternity-case-suddenly-recuses-himself-as-lunden-roberts-attorneys-ask-for-hunter-to-be-held-in-contempt-for-withholding-financial-records/", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.teaparty.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Favicon-Tea-Party.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "google-site-verification": "BUmroTlpSK6UfDeL-RF65T8u9-kL5ZhBtj6sufpwNGY"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.teaparty.org/breaking-judge-in-hunter-bidens-paternity-case-suddenly-recuses-himself-as-lunden-roberts-attorneys-ask-for-hunter-to-be-held-in-contempt-for-withholding-financial-records-422961/"}
