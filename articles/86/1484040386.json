Having blazed most of the 9.3 mile-race, Kiplimo put his arms up in celebratory fashion \u2014 albeit a bit too soon.\n\nAs Kiplimo was putting his arms up, Kibiwott Kandie took full advantage and passed him to the finish line by mere inches to claim the win \u2014 and record. It was Kandie who walked away victorious and with the record (previously held by Paul Tergat), while Kiplimo was left, well, in regret.\n\nKandie eclipsed the 43-minute mark of the 15-kilometer race, the first to do so, with a winning time of 42.59. Kiplimo, who ran for Uganda in the 2016 Rio Olympics, finished with a time of 43:00.\n\nKiplimo is the 2017 IAAF World Cross Country Junior champion, and in 2019 he became the World Cross Country Silver medallist at the age of 18.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Runner Jacob Kiplimo celebrated too early and was beaten to the finish line by inches as Kibiwott Kandie won the\u00a0San Silvestre de Sao Paulo Road Race.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Olympic runner prematurely celebrates near finish line, blows race and chance at record", "description": "Runner Jacob Kiplimo celebrated too early and was beaten to the finish line by inches as Kibiwott Kandie won the\u00a0San Silvestre de Sao Paulo Road Race.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2020/01/01/jacob-kiplimo-celebrates-early-kibiwott-kandie-wins-sao-paulo-race/2789687001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/01/01/USAT/7c579f50-676d-48b3-9884-caa5d5917685-AP_Brazil_Sao_Silvestre_Race.JPG?crop=2758,1551,x0,y0&width=2758&height=1551&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 2758, "height": 1551}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Scott Gleeson", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Runner Jacob Kiplimo celebrated too early and was beaten to the finish line by inches as Kibiwott Kandie won the\u00a0San Silvestre de Sao Paulo Road Race.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/01/01/USAT/7c579f50-676d-48b3-9884-caa5d5917685-AP_Brazil_Sao_Silvestre_Race.JPG?crop=2758,1551,x0,y0&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Olympic runner prematurely celebrates near finish line, blows race and chance at record", "description": "Runner Jacob Kiplimo celebrated too early and was beaten to the finish line by inches as Kibiwott Kandie won the\u00a0San Silvestre de Sao Paulo Road Race."}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2020/01/01/jacob-kiplimo-celebrates-early-kibiwott-kandie-wins-sao-paulo-race/2789687001/"}
