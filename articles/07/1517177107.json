The announcement comes after her row last week with the party\u2019s branch in Thuringia, which aligned with the right-wing AfD to oust a leftist state premier.\n\nThe next national elections are set for 2021. Merkel stood down as CDU leader in 2018, saying she would not seek reelection. Kramp-Karrenbauer took over as party leader months later and was widely expected to seek chancellorship as the two jobs go hand in hand.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer's resignation", "Germany's CDU party", "Angela Merkel"], "tags": ["Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer", "Angela Merkel", "Germany", "Christian Democratic Union (CDU)"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The resignation of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s successor from the helm of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is the beginning of its end, the former foreign minister said Monday.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn3.img.sputniknews.com/i/sputnik.png", "meta_data": {"description": "MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The resignation of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s successor from the helm of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is the beginning of its end, the former foreign minister said Monday.", "keywords": "Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer's resignation, Germany's CDU party, Angela Merkel", "news_keywords": "Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer's resignation, Germany's CDU party, Angela Merkel", "robots": "all", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "ahrefs-site-verification": "ahrefs-site-verification_899ad24abeb428773ae480d902877f72151b81b12d4b7293cbfa1c452c76adcd", "analytics": {"site_domain": "sputniknews.com", "article_id": 1078278852, "p_ts": 1581350721, "rubric": "europe", "tags": "Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer's resignation, Germany's CDU party, Angela Merkel"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SputnikInt", "url": "https://sputniknews.com/europe/202002101078278852-resignation-of-merkels-successor-marks-end-of-her-conservative-party--ex-minister/", "title": "Resignation of Merkel\u2019s Successor Marks End of Her Conservative Party \u2013 Ex-Minister", "description": "MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The resignation of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s successor from the helm of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is the beginning of its end, the former foreign minister said Monday.", "image": "https://sputniknews.com/sharing_snippet/1078278852.png?1581350721"}, "fb": {"app_id": 799135720145118, "pages": 357990416180}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=969452947, app-argument=com.sputniknews://article?issuer_id=17&issuer_article_id=1078278852", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.sputniknews.sputnik", "og": {"title": "Resignation of Merkel\u2019s Successor Marks End of Her Conservative Party \u2013 Ex-Minister", "url": "https://sputniknews.com/europe/202002101078278852-resignation-of-merkels-successor-marks-end-of-her-conservative-party--ex-minister/", "type": "website", "description": "MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The resignation of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s successor from the helm of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is the beginning of its end, the former foreign minister said Monday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn4.img.sputniknews.com/images/107030/19/1070301910.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 440}}, "lastmod": "2020-02-10T16:06:43Z", "pubdate": "2020-02-10T16:05:21Z", "url_type": "usual"}, "canonical_link": "https://sputniknews.com/europe/202002101078278852-resignation-of-merkels-successor-marks-end-of-her-conservative-party--ex-minister/"}
