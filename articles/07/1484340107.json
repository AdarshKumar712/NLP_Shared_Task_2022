the work being done by the city isn't translating to lower totals.\n\n\"The city has taken some really positive steps forward, but I think there's still a long ways to go,\" he says. \"I'd like to see the city be more aggressive in implementing the tenants of Vision Zero here in Denver.\"\n\nMaps provided by the city show few areas are immune to fatal accidents.\n\nIn 2020, the city plans on creating additional protected bike lanes, while exploring creative crosswalk options like the HAWK traffic signal.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["local", "problem solvers", "deadliest year on
