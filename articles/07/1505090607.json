The name \"Wiener schnitzel\" literally means \"Viennese schnitzel.\"\n\nAlthough you find schnitzel on menus all over the city, there's one historic restaurant that is widely considered the home of the dish: Figlm\u00fcller.\n\nIt's a family restaurant \u2014 now run by the fourth generation of Figlm\u00fcllers \u2014 that started life as a small wine tavern in 1905 on a street named Wollzeile, just behind the cathedral.\n\nA community soon grew, so Figlm\u00fcller decided his thirsty customers needed something to eat alongside their drinks: Enter, the schnitzel. And they've never looked back.\n\nTraditionally, schnitzel is made with veal, but 100 years ago it was too expensive for everyday folk so Figlm\u00fcller decided to use pork instead, and they still do.\n\nOn a recent trip to Vienna, I had a private schnitzel-cooking lesson with Figlm\u00fcller's head chef to find out exactly how the dish is made, and what's so special about it.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Rachel Hosie"], "publish_date": "Sun Jan 26 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "An emblem of Vienna, schnitzel is simple and incredibly delicious, but it's also quite a lot of effort and trickier than I thought to get right.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/public/assets/INSIDER/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png?v=2021-08", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "I learned how to make authentic Wiener schnitzel at the home of the dish in Vienna, and was shocked by how technical it was", "date": "2020-01-26", "pubdate": "2020-01-26T11:20:00Z", "lastmod": "2020-01-26T11:48:44Z", "news_keywords": "Features, Vienna, Vienna Insider, Cooking, Recipe, Austria, Travel, Food, Rachel Hosie", "description": "An emblem of Vienna, schnitzel is simple and incredibly delicious, but it's also quite a lot of effort and trickier than I thought to get right.", "author": "Rachel Hosie", "article": {"publisher": "insider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Travel", "og": {"title": "I learned how to make authentic Wiener schnitzel at the home of the dish in Vienna, and was shocked by how technical it was", "description": "An emblem of Vienna, schnitzel is simple and incredibly delicious, but it's also quite a lot of effort and trickier than I thought to get right.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.insider.com/wiener-schnitzel-how-to-make-figlmueller-vienna-austria-recipe-2020-1", "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e29cef3ab49fd3d02488cc1?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "I learned how to make authentic Wiener schnitzel at the home of the dish in Vienna, and was shocked by how technical it was", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-26", "sailthru.tags": "Features, Vienna, Vienna Insider, Cooking, Recipe, Austria, Travel, Food, Rachel Hosie", "sailthru.description": "An emblem of Vienna, schnitzel is simple and incredibly delicious, but it's also quite a lot of effort and trickier than I thought to get right.", "sailthru.author": "Rachel Hosie", "sailthru.verticals": "travel, food, lifestyle", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/5e29cfdeab49fd435008d125?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/5e29cfdeab49fd435008d125?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thisisinsider"}, "Insider": "Snapchat", "I learned how to make authentic Wiener schnitzel at the home of the dish in Vienna, and was shocked by how technical it was": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"bii-imgalt": "rachel hosie making figlmu\u0308ller schnitzel"}}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 1413475698959824}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.insider.com/wiener-schnitzel-how-to-make-figlmueller-vienna-austria-recipe-2020-1?fbia"}, "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"newsletter-email-input": "variant"}, "ii-split-test": {"download-app-cta": "sharebar"}, "viking-id": "5e29b584ab49fd3b0e5a8a1f", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/INSIDER/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2021-08", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Insider"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/wiener-schnitzel-how-to-make-figlmueller-vienna-austria-recipe-2020-1"}
