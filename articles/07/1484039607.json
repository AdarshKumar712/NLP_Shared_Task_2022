It\u2019s the perfect time to make clear a significant point on Anakin\u2019s history since the last(?) of 9 movies is out in the Skywalker Saga right this minute. The following article does NOT contain major spoiler beyond the point that the trailers for The Rise of Skywalker made abundantly clear: That Emperor Palpatine isn\u2019t necessarily as \u201cdead\u201d as we previously assumed.\n\nIn Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, we see Shmi Skywalker suggest to Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn that her son, Anakin Skywalker, had no father. Not just no father because the father wasn\u2019t in the picture \u2013 no \u2013 absolutely no father whatsoever. \u201cThere was no father,\u201d she said.\n\nQui-Gon Jinn hypothesized that Anakin was conceived by midi-chlorians. Midi-chlorians are microscopic life forms that \u201creside within all living cells\u201d according to Qui-Gon. These life forms are a conduit through which beings like Anakin and Qui-Gon are able to interact with and sense The Force.\n\nSidenote: The planet with no name, aka \u201cWellspring of Life\u201d appears in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, in the episode \u201cDestiny\u201d and \u201cSacrifice\u201d. This planet is the home planet of and birthplace of Midi-chlorians.\n\nThe exact nature of Anakin\u2019s manifestation is still unknown \u2013 beyond what we\u2019ve seen in The Phantom Menace. HOWEVER, a pair of panels in a comic by the name of Darth Vader (number 25, 2018) shows what might\u2019ve appeared to be a major clue. In the comic, Anakin had a dream.\n\nIn the dream, as you\u2019ll see above, you could very easily conclude that The Emperor (Palpatine) had something to do with the creation of Anakin in the womb of Shmi Skywalker. Palpatine stands behind Shmi, smiling, as Shmi\u2019s pregnancy is shown as a swirl of red and black.\n\nTo confirm the reality of the situation \u2013 the most important part of the conclusions that could be made from these panels, Lucasfilm Story Group Creative Executive Matt Martin spoke up on Twitter. As part of the official Lucasfilm Story Group, Martin is, as he says, \u201csomeone with an official say on what is and isn\u2019t canon in the Star Wars galaxy.\u201d\n\nAbove, the first panel in question is referenced in a question from a Star Wars fan to Martin. Per Martin, \u201cI\u2019ve gone into this at length a few times. No, that is not what the comic is implying. Just no. There\u2019s more to that comic than those two panels. It should be read in context.\u201d\n\nReplying to Martin, another Star Wars fan says \u201cWhat? It may just be Anakin\u2019s fear or something like that but it was definitely the implication. ESPECIALLY when you read it in context. Like a page later there\u2019s a shot of Palpatine with the text \u2018I am your father\u2019, people weren\u2019t making this connection out of thin air.\u201d That panel is shown below \u2013 in the same Darth Vader comic.\n\n\u201cBut this is all in Anakin\u2019s head,\u201d said Martin. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that idea, a concept that Palps hinted at to Anakin himself, be something likely to freak Anakin out? Something that would linger in his mind? \u201cOh crap, what if he made me!\u201d Doesn\u2019t make it true. It\u2019s all through Anakin\u2019s lens.\u201d\n\nA few more comments appear on Twitter, including a reply from a fan who says \u201cI think the best way to about it is to leave it up to interpretation, that\u2019s what vision sequences are all about.\u201d\n\nThen the final word from Martin: \u201cBut I can tell you definitively, as someone who worked on the comic, that is 100% not the intended implication. I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t a logical misinterpretation that they\u2019re coming to. I\u2019m just telling you definitively that it\u2019s not correct.\u201d\n\nStar Wars Episode 9, The Rise of Skywalker, was in theaters at press time for this article, on January 1, 2020. The streaming service Disney+ gave access to all other Star Wars: Skywalker Saga films at that time, episodes 1 through 8. If you\u2019d like to see the rest of the Darth Vader, you\u2019ll need to head to your local comic shop.
