Winky D is not a deity.\n\n\u201cThe jersey is synonymous with prisoners as you know and Calaz has been long associated with prisoners from the start of his career, hence the Banditi moniker as you know that people euphemistically refer to prisoners as bandits,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe has worked and continues to work with Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services by reaching out to inmates and supporting them materially and also emotionally.H-Metro", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  8 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.zimeye.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/zimeye.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.zimeye.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot_2020-01-08-11-20-58-1.png"}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.zimeye.net/2020/01/08/seh-calaz-denies-imitating-winky-d/"}
