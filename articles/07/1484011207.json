The main portion of the camp will run from Jan. 5-25 in Doha, Qatar, and the camp will officially conclude with a friendly against Costa Rica on Feb. 1 in Los Angeles.\n\nAs usual, the roster is heavily dominated by MLS players. Traditionally, U.S. Soccer uses this camp as a chance to call in players who are outside the normal group and it is often used as a way to give younger or overlooked players an extended look.\n\nFor the most part, this roster fits that profile. All but three of the players are based in the United States and 14 MLS teams are represented. FC Dallas (three) is the only team with more representation than the Sounders. Morris (39 caps) will actually be the second-most capped player in camp, trailing only Gyasi Zardes, while Roldan (19) will be the fourth-most capped.\n\nThe downside is that this likely means Morris and Roldan will miss the first two or three weeks of Sounders\u2019 training camp, which is scheduled to open on Jan. 14 at Starfire and moves to Southern California from Jan. 19-29. They would likely rejoin the Sounders when the team returns to the Seattle area from Feb. 1-5.\n\nAlthough MLS teams have the ability to decline call-ups since this camp falls outside of an official FIFA date \u2014 and Atlanta United apparently did just that with Miles Robinson \u2014 the Sounders have never made a habit of declining USMNT requests. Both Sounders players have also previously expressed a desire to report to USMNT camp whenever they\u2019re given the chance.\n\nUSA ROSTER BY POSITION (Club; Caps/Goals):\n\nGOALKEEPERS (4): Bill Hamid (D.C.
