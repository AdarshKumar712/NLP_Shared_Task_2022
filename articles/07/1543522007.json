"movies": [], "text": "The attorney-general Christian Porter has suggested the higher rate of hourly pay casual workers receive mean many will have \u201calready made provisions\u201d if forced to take two-weeks unpaid leave because of the coronavirus crisis, and the government will not \u201cjump to a solution in anticipation of a problem\u201d.\n\nAs the government struggles to answer what solutions it is putting in place for Australia\u2019s 3.3 million unsecured workforce, who do not receive sick leave entitlements, Porter told the ABC he did not expect it to be a universal problem.\n\n\u201cMany people would have already made provisions for that because of course the purpose of casual employment is that you\u2019re paid extra in-lieu of the types of entitlements,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf it is the case that large numbers of people in particular industry sectors by virtue of the casual nature of their employment are having these types of problems and that is something we\u2019re aware could happen, that is something that can be responded to, likely through the welfare system, but there might be other options.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to jump to a solution in anticipation of a problem that is broad before that problem has arisen or we reasonably know that it will arise.\u201d\n\nMorrison warns coronavirus hit could be worse than GFC amid recession predictions Read more\n\nEarlier, Labor had warned the Morrison government not to drag its feet on help for casual workers in the midst of a looming coronavirus employment crisis, after a roundtable discussion on the issue led to no concrete solutions for vulnerable employees.\n\nTony Burke and Linda Burney said Australia\u2019s casual and contract workforce could not afford to wait to learn whether or not they would be paid sick leave in the event they were forced to self-isolate for two weeks.\n\n\u201cIf casuals aren\u2019t given that reassurance sooner rather than later we run the risk people will turn up to work when they\u2019re sick because they simply cannot afford to stay home and lose their pay,\u201d the Labor MPs said.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about supporting Australia\u2019s often vulnerable or insecure casual workers \u2013 it\u2019s about containing the spread of this virus.\u201d\n\nThe government is yet to say whether or not it will support workers without sick leave entitlements as part of its coronavirus stimulus package.\n\nPorter, who led a roundtable discussion with unions and employer and business groups on Tuesday, said the challenges faced by casual workers would be \u201cone of the many things that need to be considered\u201d by the government, but gave no answers on how it would do that.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re preferring to see this problem as about how we make sure that businesses keep employing people and provide the goods and services that we rely on during challenging times,\u201d he said afterwards.\n\n\u201cOf course there\u2019s a sectorial component to that with different parts of the workforce being affected differently. We listened very carefully to what the unions have had to say, obviously, but they certainly weren\u2019t the only voice in the room.\u201d\n\nThe head of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, said the government needed to prioritise supporting casual workers who would be forced to take unpaid time off work to ensure the coronavirus was \u201ccontained and controlled\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ACTU secretary Sally McManus listens as industrial relations minister Christian Porter speaks during the coronavirus roundtable.

I mean, there will always be a temptation to have industrial action when it has the greatest effect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIndustrial action of any type at the moment would have a very, very large and negative effect. The reality is that there are already businesses suffering from disruptions to supply chains \u2013 that will mean that it will become harder for them to produce the goods and services that we all rely on every day.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Coronavirus outbreak", "Industrial relations", "Australian politics", "Australian trade unions", "Business", "Australia news", "Australian economy", "Coalition", "Labor party", "Christian Porter"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Amy Remeikis"], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 10 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A roundtable discussion led by Christian Porter produces no concrete solutions for vulnerable workers", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/fee5e2d638d1c35f6d501fa397e53329/152x152.png", "meta_data": {"description": "A roundtable discussion led by Christian Porter produces no concrete solutions for vulnerable workers", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Amy Remeikis", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1790b5ac2bd9dff79149deb17eb0cdad8547c25d/587_148_4750_2850/master/4750.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=18648cd1d3e65600c9e065a94d78207e", "keywords": "Coronavirus outbreak,Industrial relations,Australian politics,Australian trade unions,Business,Australia news,Australian economy,Coalition,Labor party,Christian Porter", "news_keywords": "Coronavirus outbreak,Industrial relations,Australian politics,Australian trade unions,Business,Australia news,Australian economy,Coalition,Labor party,Christian Porter", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/australian-government-warned-not-to-drag-its-feet-on-help-for-casual-workers-in-coronavirus-crisis", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1790b5ac2bd9dff79149deb17eb0cdad8547c25d/587_148_4750_2850/master/4750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=281b49d90d5f17f250da7298a8bd4fa9", "description": "A roundtable discussion led by Christian Porter produces no concrete solutions for vulnerable workers", "type": "article", "title": "Australian government won't 'jump to a solution' to help casual workers in coronavirus crisis", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amy-remeikis", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "World news", "published_time": "2020-03-10T06:12:07.000Z", "tag": "Coronavirus outbreak,Industrial relations,Australian politics,Australian trade unions,Business,Australia news,Australian economy,Coalition,Labor party,Christian Porter", "modified_time": "2020-03-10T06:12:07.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2020/mar/10/australian-government-warned-not-to-drag-its-feet-on-help-for-casual-workers-in-coronavirus-crisis?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2020/mar/10/australian-government-warned-not-to-drag-its-feet-on-help-for-casual-workers-in-coronavirus-crisis?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/australian-government-warned-not-to-drag-its-feet-on-help-for-casual-workers-in-coronavirus-crisis", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2020/mar/10/australian-government-warned-not-to-drag-its-feet-on-help-for-casual-workers-in-coronavirus-crisis?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1790b5ac2bd9dff79149deb17eb0cdad8547c25d/587_148_4750_2850/master/4750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=7999b1af1f5e65c7cf6153cc5aaf3e58", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@amyremeikis", "dnt": "on"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/australian-government-warned-not-to-drag-its-feet-on-help-for-casual-workers-in-coronavirus-crisis"}
