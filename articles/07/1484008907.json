The USMCA, moving through the approval process, \u201creinforces the long-standing cooperation and partnership that exists between food processors, producers on both sides of the border,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cWe have a very integrated sector in terms of ag, whether it\u2019s shipment of piglets from Manitoba to places like Iowa, for fattening and processing eventually.\u201d\n\nConversely, there is a lot of shipment of processed foods and beverages from those states.\n\nScience-based\n\nSteven Buchta is the Canadian consul and trade commissioner covering agriculture.\n\nlisten live watch live\n\n\u201cI think one of the benefits that was achieved for all three countries was improved language on a science-based approach to agriculture, including biotechnology,\u201d Buchta says. \u201cIt was an opportunity for all three countries, as leaders in using science in agriculture, to have provisions and a regulatory framework agreed-to in the agreement, or protocols to communicate on those matters spelled out as well as possible.\u201d\n\nCanada has an embassy in Washington, D.C., but also a mission in New York, a liaison office in San Diego, with consulates in 17 major cities, including Minneapolis. A consulate helps facilitate trade between Canada and partners in the area states. Officials help companies on both sides evaluate opportunities and regulations.\n\nDelouya says that since the North American Free Trade Agreement, predecessor to the USMCA, was approved in 1994, agricultural trade among the three countries has tripled, further linking a market of 480 million people. Thirty U.S. states count Canada as their top export market. Three of the biggest ag trade states are Minnesota, with $1.3 billion in annual trade, and North Dakota, $900 million; and South Dakota, about $300 million.\n\nTo compare, overall U.S-Canada trade accounts for about $2 billion a day in every sector and every service \u2014 about $800 billion a year in bilateral trade.\n\nOne of the big \u201casks\u201d in the USMCA by U.S. agriculture was greater access to Canada markets for dairy, poultry and eggs, which had to be reconciled with Canada\u2019s supply management \u2014 permits and quotas in those areas. The Canadians agreed to eliminate a couple of their dairy product classifications, involving milk protein supplements and infant formula.\n\nA USMCA provision also improves the grain grading standards.\n\n\u2018Entry into force\u2019\n\nChanges will come into effect six months after the \u201centry into force\u201d of USMCA.\n\nThe U.S. House now has approved it. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, announced Dec. 20 that he\u2019ll lead a markup of its ratification on Jan. 7, the first day the Senate will be in session in 2020. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said the Senate won\u2019t consider it until after the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.\n\nMexico ratified the agreement last June and now will have to re-approve it with the latest changes.\n\nCanada had an election in October and were working their way through approving the USMCA. Now it has to be re-introduced in a new Parliament, where it is expected to pass.\n\nDelouya says that \u201cgiving credit where credit is due,\u201d he emphasized it was Trump who \u201creally wanted to get to a new deal that was more in line with current trade realities between the three countries.\u201d\n\nIssues like digital trade weren\u2019t important when NAFTA was approved in 1994, but are now.\n\nIt includes labor and environment provisions important particularly in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\u201cThere are some enforceable provisions that make the agreement a little more \u2018toothy,\u2019\u201d Delouya says, as well as manufacturing. He says the agreement is in force for 16 years, subject to review every five years.\n\n\u201cIt gives us \u2014 consumers, businesses, investors, farmers \u2014 predictable environment in which to operate going forward. At least now the lay of the land is clear with respect to market access in the case of farmers and producers.
