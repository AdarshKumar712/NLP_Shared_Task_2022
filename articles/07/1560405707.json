We must manage to slow down the rate of new infections,\u201d Spahn said.\n\nCurrently, the government is working to increase hospital capacity and ramping up testing to prepare for a surge of COVID-19 patients. Spahn also emphasised the importance of the current contact restrictions to slow down the pace of infection.\n\nMedical professionals administered around 360,000 tests in the last week.\n\nRKI President Wieler said that an estimated 5,900 people have recovered from the virus in Germany. However, there are still more than 36,000 confirmed cases, and he reiterated that it is too early to know whether the rise in infections is slowing down as a result of the government\u2019s restrictions. There also remain strong regional differences with North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria, and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg being the worst affected.
