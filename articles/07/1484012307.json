Two tankers came in late yesterday and there's a ration to allow motorists enough to fuel up and get out.\n\nThis comes as the Rural Fire Service has issued a map of highlighting an area 250km long from Batemans Bay to the Victorian border, where tourists were being asked to leave.\n\nTourist Leave Zone \u2013 South Coast Bush Fires\n\n\n\nDangerous conditions for holiday makers on the South Coast of NSW this weekend\n\n\n\nWith the widespread power and communications outages across the South Coast please share this information to as many affected people as possible. #nswrfs pic.twitter.com/JvbwrpC1fe \u2014 NSW RFS (@NSWRFS) January 1, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nThere's a 24-hour window today to evacuate the region before extreme fire conditions return on Saturday.\n\nMotorists are now able to travel north on the Princes Highway from Batemans Bay. A reduced speed limit of 60km/h is in place.\n\nFireys say there's 'no hope' of containing blazes before Saturday. Three watch and acts on South Coast. 110 fires burning across NSW, half of them uncontained.\n\nSeven people have died so far in these fires since Monday and 176 homes have been lost.\n\nA 72-year-old man remains unaccounted for at Belowra, about 50km north west of Cobargo.\n\nPicture, Alex Coppel", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["VIC", "NSW", "bushfires", "firefighters"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Benjamin Graham"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 13:48:17 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "<p>Authorities have less than 24 hours to move the thousands of people stranded on the NSW South Coast who face a humanitarian crisis amid looming horror fire conditions.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/99ae28ba58e6719abd9d8575bdc18a54?s=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0", "msvalidate.01": "E4F703CD48F87DE6C0404D393EE90A13", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Troops prepare for evacuations by sea", "url": "https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/australian-troops-prepare-for-bushfire-emergency-evacuations-by-sea/live-coverage/cf3d149ec9bbb9b7eb808e663eec8a28", "description": "Authorities have less than 24 hours to move the thousands of people stranded on the NSW South Coast who face a humanitarian crisis amid looming horror fire conditions.", "site_name": "news.com.au \u2014 Australia\u2019s #1 news site", "image": {"identifier": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d39b4d2dfa7685a6f04230cae0272f0d", "width": 200, "height": 200}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T13:48:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T20:10:36+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "twitter": {"site": "@newscomauHQ", "text": {"title": "Troops prepare for evacuations by\u00a0sea"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d39b4d2dfa7685a6f04230cae0272f0d", "src": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d39b4d2dfa7685a6f04230cae0272f0d"}, "card": "summary", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1454481155, affiliate-data=https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/news-com-au/id1454481155?mt=8&ct=smartbanner, app-argument=https://www.news.com.au", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.newscorp.newscomau.app", "application-name": "news.com.au", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://www.news.com.au/feed/;icon-uri=https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/99ae28ba58e6719abd9d8575bdc18a54?s=16", "description": "<p>Authorities have less than 24 hours to move the thousands of people stranded on the NSW South Coast who face a humanitarian crisis amid looming horror fire conditions.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "keywords": "VIC,NSW,bushfires,firefighters", "msapplication-config": "https://www.news.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nca/assets/dist/img/common/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "news.com.au", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 113758722003364, "admins": "1533025129,653135158,737988273"}, "referrer": "origin"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/australian-troops-prepare-for-bushfire-emergency-evacuations-by-sea/live-coverage/cf3d149ec9bbb9b7eb808e663eec8a28"}
