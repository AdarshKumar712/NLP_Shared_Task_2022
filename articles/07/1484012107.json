We\u2019ve loved meeting so many of you from around the world and can\u2019t wait to meet many more of you next year,\u201d the Duke and Duchess of Sussex captioned their video. \u201cWe hope 2020 brings each of you health and continued happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo all the fantastic organisations and inspirational people we met and worked with in 2019: Thank you for a wonderful year, and see you in 2020!,\u201d Prince William and Kate shared in their Instagram post.\n\nPrince William, 37, kicked off New Year\u2019s Eve by looking ahead to the future. On Tuesday, the Duke of Cambridge unveiled a new initiative called the Earthshot Prize, which will be awarded to five winners each year over the next decade. The hope is for \u201cEarth\u2019s greatest problem solvers to solve Earth\u2019s greatest environmental problems,\u201d the palace said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Kate, also 37, has seemingly turned her attention to maternal health. Last week she wrote a letter honoring the work of midwives. She noted in her tribute that 2020 will be named International Year of the Nurse and Midwife.\n\nPrince Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, are enjoying time off at the moment, having spent the holidays in Canada with the duchess\u2019 mother, Doria Ragland, and their son.\n\nThis past year was a busy one for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who welcomed Archie in May, and in September, took him on a royal tour to Africa.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020, ABC Audio.
