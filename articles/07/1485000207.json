I pulled him backwards trying to get him away from grandma. But I did grab the knife. I held that to his neck also. He bent back my finger, which is still sore right now. He head-butted me, which I have a loose tooth from that, but I do not really care.\n\nShortly after the knife was thrown away, Johnston fled the vehicle by foot and was later arrested Monday morning \u201cwithout incident,\u201d said law enforcement.\n\nThe 92-year-old great grandmother and 76-year-old grandfather are expected to make a full recovery.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked lately about my worry for the trauma impacting so many in our modern era,\u201d said Gonzalez. \u201cSurely, this entire family, including the 12-year-old, has new trauma to process.\u201d\n\nJohnston faces two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nThe suspect is being held on $140,000 bond.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Texas", "B Inspired", "Iran Retreats from U.S. Embassy", "Lucian Adrian Johnston"], "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A 12-year-old boy was\u00a0praised for his heroism for saving the lives of his grandparents during an alleged stabbing attack, say police.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.svg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "A 12-year-old boy was\u00a0praised for his heroism for saving the lives of his grandparents during an alleged stabbing attack, say police.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "12-Year-Old Boy Saves Grandparents After Stabbing Attack", "description": "A 12-year-old boy was\u00a0praised for his heroism for saving the lives of his grandparents during an alleged stabbing attack, say police.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2020/01/01/police-12-year-old-boy-saves-grandparents-after-half-brother-stabs-them/", "site_name": "Breitbart", "updated_time": "2020-01-02T13:44:05+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/01/Lucian-Adrian-Johnston-stabbing-grandparents-Harris-County-Sheriffs-Office-640x335.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/01/Lucian-Adrian-Johnston-stabbing-grandparents-Harris-County-Sheriffs-Office-640x335.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 335, "alt": "A 12-year-old-boy's half brother, Lucian Adrian Johnston, 20, allegedly stabbed his great-grandparents in the head and neck from the back seat after he was told he could no longer live with them as a result of his behavior, according to the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office."}, "article": {"author": {"image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/authors/145x100/1jcaplan.png"}}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "tag": "Texas", "section": "Crime", "published_time": "2020-01-02T01:16:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-02T13:44:05+00:00", "categories": "Politics,Local,Crime"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A 12-year-old boy was\u00a0praised for his heroism for saving the lives of his grandparents during an alleged stabbing attack, say police.", "title": "12-Year-Old Boy Saves Grandparents After Stabbing Attack", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/01/Lucian-Adrian-Johnston-stabbing-grandparents-Harris-County-Sheriffs-Office.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews"}, "author": "Joshua Caplan", "news_keywords": "Lucian Adrian Johnston,Texas", "pubdate": "2020-01-01T17:16:09Z", "lastmod": "2020-01-02T05:44:05Z", "reqtime": 1577973776, "time": 1577973776, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2020/01/01/police-12-year-old-boy-saves-grandparents-after-half-brother-stabs-them/"}
