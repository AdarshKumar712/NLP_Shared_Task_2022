You won\u2019t play the next game.\"\n\nWhen asked if this was missing under Solskjaer, he replied: \u201cProbably. By the looks of it, I think so, yeah.\u201d\n\nVan Persie\u2019s former team-mate, Rio Ferdinand, doesn\u2019t believe there is any lack of desire or determination in the Old Trafford dressing room.\n\nHowever, he wasn\u2019t at all convinced by United\u2019s attacking play \u2013 and thinks, however young the players at his disposal, Solskjaer has to find a greater consistency in performances.\n\n\u201cWhen I watched Man Utd play here last season in an game, they had structure and I was thinking, \u2018Woah, this is Man Utd\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see those patterns [of play] or the idea that they\u2019ve been told to do this, this is the pattern of play that happens.\n\n\u201cToday it looked very much like, \u2018Get the ball to Martial and see what he can do\u2019. That\u2019s what it seemed like.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of the boys in that changing room, I\u2019ve seen a lot of them grow up.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re kids who want to do well, they\u2019re desperate to play, they\u2019re desperate to be the best in their position, they\u2019re desperate to do great in a Man Utd shirt.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s just not happening at the moment and that has got to be sorted out and the consistency is the biggest problem at the moment.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s used 10 players under 22 this season. That\u2019s a lot of young players.\n\n\u201cBut they need consistency, they have got to find it somehow and that is the job of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Manchester United", "Ole Solskj\u00e6r", "Premier League", "Arsenal", "Arsenal v Manchester United", "Robin van Persie", "Rio Ferdinand"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 22:50:02 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Robin van Persie thinks Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is lacking the fear factor necessary to get the best out of his Manchester United team.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "description": "Robin van Persie thinks Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is lacking the fear factor necessary to get the best out of his Manchester United team.", "keywords": "Manchester United,Ole Solskj\u00e6r,Premier League,Arsenal,Arsenal v Manchester United,Robin van Persie,Rio Ferdinand", "robots": "max-snippet:1000, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:1000, INDEX, FOLLOW", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@goal"}, "og": {"title": "Solskjaer lacking Ferguson's fear factor in Man Utd dressing room, says Van Persie | Goal.com", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.goal.com/en/news/solskjaer-lacking-fergusons-fear-factor-in-man-utd-dressing-room-/oomqgagr6t451qb59k0qush8r", "description": "Robin van Persie thinks Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is lacking the fear factor necessary to get the best out of his Manchester United team.", "image": "https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/GOAL/75/97/aaron-wan-bissaka-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-manchester-united-arsenal-2019-20_z49taxsw4bhh12fo6ivn2j5du.jpg?t=1747092223&quality=100&h=300"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#081f2c", "theme-color": "#081f2c", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.kokteyl.goal"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.goal.com/en/news/solskjaer-lacking-fergusons-fear-factor-in-man-utd-dressing-room-/oomqgagr6t451qb59k0qush8r"}
