He is survived by his wife, Dianne Bock Stern, and their two sons, Eric and Andrew.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Basketball", "adam silver", "david stern", "nba", "obits", "obituaries"], "tags": ["david stern", "nba", "obits", "obituaries", "adam silver"], "authors": ["January"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "David Stern, the former NBA commissioner who turned the league into a powerhouse over three decades, died Wednesday at the age of 77, the league announced.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/nypost-2016/static/images/apple-icons/nypost/apple-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
