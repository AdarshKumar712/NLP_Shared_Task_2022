From purging pieces from her closet to recommending she only wear small sunglasses, Kanye\u2019s never held back his true feelings when it comes to Kim\u2019s look. So, it\u2019s no surprise that Kanye was the mastermind behind one of Kim\u2019s most memorable fashion moments.\n\nNearly one year after Kim, 38, made an iconic style statement in Miami when she sported a skin-tight latex mini dress and a waist-length neon green wig that perfectly matched her neon Lamborghini, the KKW Beauty mogul revealed that her husband was the one who inspired her to do it.\n\n\u201cI remember we had regular hair and then we FaceTimed Kanye,\u201d Kim told her hairstylist Chris Appleton for his Gay Times cover story. \u201cHe was like, \u2018You\u2019re in Miami, do neon hair. I\u2019m getting you a neon car, it\u2019ll be downstairs \u2013 just trust me on this one. You need neon!\u2019\n\nGarguibo/SplashNews.com More\n\nKim said change was very last-minute, but ultimately she was so happy to go with Kanye\u2019s suggestion.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: Every Way Kanye West Has Transformed Kim Kardashian\u2019s Style Over the Years (and One Way He Hasn\u2019t)\n\n\u201cWe were like, \u2018What? We are running out the door!\u2019 We had full black hair and we changed that last minute. That was so fun, but crazy!\u201d the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star said.\n\nGarguibo/SplashNews.com More\n\nAppleton, who styled the look for Kim, agreed, calling it one of his favorite styles on her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this and I would probably say the blonde was one of my favorites as we had so many great moments. But the neon green is right behind it!\u201d Appleton told Gay Times.\n\nKim frequently credits Kanye as the biggest influence when it comes to her her fashion and beauty looks.\n\n\u201cI really do get all of my inspiration from my husband,\u201d the star previously told PEOPLE. \u201cHe makes my life so easy.\u201d\n\nAs for putting ensembles together, more often than not, Kim gravitates towards the pieces her husband designs himself.\n\n\u201cI literally just wear all of the Yeezy samples,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have a team of stylists and they put it all together,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m totally inspired by Kanye and the Yeezy team \u2014 and listen to the advice of everyone over there who is making all the clothes.\u201d\n\nKanye\u2019s close relationships with designers also gave Kim a better appreciate for high fashion. \u201cMy style has definitely evolved,\u201d she told PEOPLE. \u201cWhen I met Kanye and he really started to bring me to Paris he introduced me to a bunch of people. I think one of the first people I met were [designers] Riccardo Tisci and Alber Elbaz.\u201d\n\nThe red carpet vet often gets Kanye\u2019s opinion about looks she\u2019s considering for a big event. \u201cI\u2019ll send him a picture and be like, \u2018Do you like this dress?\u2019 and he\u2019ll say, \u2018I love it but why don\u2019t you try something like this instead?\u2019\u201d she shared. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll send me references of people wearing a totally different style.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Kim Kardashian West", "Keeping Up with the Kardashians"], "authors": ["Kaitlyn Frey"], "publish_date": "Fri Jul 26 19:34:57 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Kanye West Gave Kim Kardashian the Idea to Wear a Neon Green Wig to Match Her Lamborghini", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/presentation/images/icons/win8-tile-1484740.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooEnt", "player": {"identifier": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/kim-kardashian-shares-adorable-photo-163307453.html?format=embed", "height": 281, "width": 500}, "card": "player", "description": "Kanye West Gave Kim Kardashian the Idea to Wear a Neon Green Wig to Match Her Lamborghini", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gSJUTwTl_j0Tf5Wmxg9RCA--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/2e77dbb944e060672838c817b7d11876", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gSJUTwTl_j0Tf5Wmxg9RCA--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/2e77dbb944e060672838c817b7d11876"}, "title": "Kim Kardashian Says Kanye West Told Her Wear a Neon Green Wig to Match Her Lamborghini"}, "application-name": "Yahoo Entertainment", "news_keywords": "Kanye West, Kim Kardashian West, neon green", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=cac48e44-81ce-3bad-9894-d5618e1cfe03&src=web", "description": "Kanye West Gave Kim Kardashian the Idea to Wear a Neon Green Wig to Match Her Lamborghini", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gSJUTwTl_j0Tf5Wmxg9RCA--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/2e77dbb944e060672838c817b7d11876", "description": "Kanye West Gave Kim Kardashian the Idea to Wear a Neon Green Wig to Match Her Lamborghini", "title": "Kim Kardashian Says Kanye West Told Her Wear a Neon Green Wig to Match Her Lamborghini", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/kim-kardashian-says-kanye-west-193457505.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 73756409831, "app_id": 90376669494}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=cac48e44-81ce-3bad-9894-d5618e1cfe03&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=cac48e44-81ce-3bad-9894-d5618e1cfe03&src=web"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/kim-kardashian-says-kanye-west-193457505.html"}
