O negative is the universal blood type and can be given to any patient. It is often used in emergency rooms when there is no time to determine a patient\u2019s blood type, the nonprofit said.\n\n\u201cComing out of the holiday season, we typically see a decrease in donations of all types at this time due to schools being out of session for the holidays and seasonal illnesses like the flu,\u201d said David Wellis, San Diego Blood Bank CEO. \u201cThe need for type O blood has hit a critically low level and we need the community to help us keep a safe supply for local hospital patients.\u201d\n\nDonors can visit one of San Diego Blood Bank\u2019s six centers, as well as bloodmobiles in the community. Appointments can be made at SanDiegoBloodBank.org or by calling (800) 4MY-SDBB. Walk-ins are also welcome. The centers are open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. through New Year\u2019s Eve and will be closed New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonors must be at least 17 years old, weigh at least 114 pounds and be in general good health. A government-issued photo ID is required. To prepare, donors are encouraged to get a good night\u2019s sleep, eat a healthy meal an hour beforehand and drink plenty of water.\n\nThe blood bank serves hospitals in San Diego, Orange, Imperial and Los Angeles counties.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "San Diego Blood Bank puts out call for most common blood type", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Have type O blood?
