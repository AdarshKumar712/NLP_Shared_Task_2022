Hope currently stands as the #1 team in the nation according to Massey and Trine comes in as #23. Hope had a real test against Albion, other than that they have run roughshod thru the 2019 portion of their schedule. Trine with losses to Ohio Wesleyan, #12 Baldwin Wallace and #23 Chicago. They have 2 recent wins over good Ohio Northern and Denison squads and are starting to figure things out with new lineups and substitute patterns.\n\n\n\nBoth Hope and Trine play a deep bench as both only have 1 double digit scorer. Hope with an outstanding and deep Junior class, whereas Trine has 3 Soph's leading in scoring. The big question at the beginning of the year was how far would Trine regress this year after an outstanding Senior class graduated that led Trine to 3 consecutive NCAA tournaments. This team does not have a \"go to\" player like Dawson who could single handily take over games if needed over her career. We have one Senior, two Juniors, and the rest Soph's and Freshman in the top 11 rotation.\n\n\n\nYou know Hope is going to pressure the ball and get scores off their defense. You don't see many D3 teams with their length inside either. Our bigs Taylor and Herbert will need to play well and stay out of foul trouble. If were shooting the 3ball decently we'll have a shot to be there at the end, but I am going with Hope by 10+ in this one as they have more experience and playmakers than Trine.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "MIAA", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"description": "MIAA", "robots": "noindex"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.d3boards.com/index.php?topic=4515.5160"}
