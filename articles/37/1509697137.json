Those factors must be tackled urgently. But we can take action now to give the young fish their best chance of survival before leaving their native rivers.\n\n\"We must provide shade against more of the extreme temperatures we have been told to expect, while restoring a whole ecosystem that's been degraded over many centuries. This will help our threatened salmon, and all wildlife will benefit.\"\n\nImage caption The trees could eventually help shade salmon\n\nShe added: \"Of all the major Scottish rivers, the Dee is especially vulnerable to extreme temperatures because of its land use. We are determined to do everything we can to help nature help itself.\"\n\nThe Trusts's fisheries officer Colin Esson is among those doing the planting by hand, his small spade breaking the ground to allow thousands of young saplings to be carefully placed down.\n\nHe said of his efforts: \"Hopefully it should give a bit of shelter not only to the animals but to the river.\n\n\"That's what we're concerned about - the rise in temperature, so we want to get some shelter, particularly in these high up burns, (which are) more vulnerable to higher temperatures.\"\n\nAngling in the River Dee is said to generate about \u00a315m annually and support hundreds of jobs.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["David Shanks", "Bbc Scotland Reporter"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The \u00a35.5m project aims to tackle a decline in salmon by providing shade on River Dee tributaries.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.308.03535/apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The \u00a35.5m project aims to tackle a decline in salmon by providing shade on River Dee tributaries.", "x-country": "us", "x-audience": "Domestic", "CPS_AUDIENCE": "Domestic", "CPS_CHANGEQUEUEID": 152302100, "og": {"title": "Wildlife project to see one million trees planted", "type": "article", "description": "The \u00a35.5m project aims to tackle a decline in salmon by providing shade on River Dee tributaries.", "site_name": "BBC News", "locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-51265370", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11B01/production/_110694427_salmon.jpg", "alt": "BBC News.
