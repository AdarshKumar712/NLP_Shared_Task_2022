In humans, the viruses cause respiratory infections which are typically mild including the common cold but rarer forms like SARS and MERS can be lethal.\n\nHe told the press on Wednesday that students are cooperative and in good spirits.\n\n\u201cSince the outbreak everyone has been advised to wear face masks and as a result there has been a shortage. All nationals are safe and because there is 14-day incubation period\u2026it is not advisable for anyone to leave Wuhan at the moment,\u201d he reported.\n\nThe ministry says emergency funds were sent to students to purchase water and supplies.\n\nEighty-four Dominicans are pursuing studies in China, 15 of which are based in Wuhan- the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\nWhile there has not yet been any case of the virus among Dominican students, there is also a 14-day incubation period.\n\nThe Minister assures that there is daily communication between students and the Ministry of Education.\n\nDr McIntyre gave reasons for advising the students to stay in China.\n\n\u201cThere must be a receiving country- the USA, France, Germany, London Holland- to put these students through quarantine, second, a special charter with the nationals departing China under international travel guidelines for prevention and control, and thirdly, assuming there are nationals who may test positive, that receiving country must have the infrastructure to deal with the cure or treatment of the virus.\u201d\n\nHe also added, \u201cThis can be a very costly exercise.\u201d\n\nDr McIntyre continues to assure however that \u201cAll nationals are safe\u201d and that the Dominican students are \u201cin good spirits, and fully understand the risk of leaving. The have been very vigilant. There is no need to panic.\u201d\n\nThe ministries of health, education and tourism were a part of Wednesday\u2019s event.\n\nHe says the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China has given every assurance that \u201cthis pandemic will be brought under control in a few weeks.\u201d\n\nThe Ministry of Heath is currently discussing the possibility of sending additional masks, especially for Dominican students in Wuhan as face masks must be changed frequently after use.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["dominica news", "press releases", "sports", "politics", "lifestyle", "education"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jarna Ducreay"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Dominica news source of local and caribbean news", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Dominica news source of local and caribbean news", "keywords": "dominica news, press releases, sports, politics, lifestyle, education", "google-site-verification": "PmdZKBKOVSFI3IbjVpViKpGkHdLZqjClDBX7REPleoA", "shareaholic": {"site_name": "Dominica Vibes News", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://www.dominicavibes.dm/lifestyle-262190/", "keywords": "international, lifestyle, local, news", "article_published_time": "2020-01-30T11:33:06+00:00", "article_modified_time": "2020-01-31T11:23:59+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_author_name": "Jarna Ducreay", "site_id": "39da65a5aa9ede0342f88fa230de4ea0", "wp_version": "7.6.0.4", "image": "https://www.dominicavibes.dm/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corona-virus-china-face-mask.jpg"}, "og": {"image": "https://www.dominicavibes.dm/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corona-virus-china-face-mask.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.9.13"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.dominicavibes.dm/lifestyle-262190/"}
