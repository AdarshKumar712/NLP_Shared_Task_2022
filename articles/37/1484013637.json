Picture: Elsa/Getty Images/AFP\n\nMr Mobley claimed there was no way there could be enough carbon left after a cremation to make a diamond \u2013 so when grieving families pay \u201cmuch more than the cost of a natural diamond of the same size and quality\u201d for rocks from Eterneva and companies like it, they\u2019re \u201cleft with a synthetic diamond that has no value and no ties to the ashes of a loved one\u201d.\n\nBut now the billionaire investor \u2013 who has an estimated net worth of $US4.1 billion \u2013 has returned fire, telling Page Six \u201cthe technology is backed by rock-solid science\u201d.\n\nThe company told the publication it had worked with multiple third-party chemistry labs, and tests had shown \u201con average (there\u2019s) 1 to 4 per cent carbon content (in the ashes), which is more than enough to grow a diamond\u201d.\n\nCuban said despite the controversy, \u201cone of the deals I was most excited about closing from this season of Shark Tank is \u00adEterneva\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in their product \u2026 I\u2019m such a fan that I decided to get my wife Eterneva diamonds for Christmas. I can\u2019t say enough good things about Eterneva,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on the New York Post and was reproduced with permission\n\nOriginally published as Billionaire\u2019s company slammed as a \u2018scam\u2019", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["diamond company", "synthetic diamond", "synthetic diamond company", "claim diamond company", "third-party chemistry labs", "billionaire investor", "grieving families pay", "Shark Tank", "jewellery industry", "gem expert", "synthetic diamonds", "Laguna Beach", "California", "United States of America", "Northern America", "North America", "America", "Getty Images Inc.", "New York Post Company", "Agence France Presse", "Diamond Producers Association", "Grant Mobley", "Mark Cuban", "Oli Coleman"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Dec 30 00:59:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Colourful rich-lister Mark Cuban has hit back at a critic who described a diamond company he backs as nothing more than a scam.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.heraldsun.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/heraldsun/favicon.ico?v=2", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.heraldsun.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/heraldsun/ms-icon-70x70.png", "msapplication-square144x144logo": "https://www.heraldsun.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/heraldsun/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.heraldsun.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/heraldsun/ms-icon-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.heraldsun.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/heraldsun/ms-icon-310x310.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.heraldsun.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/heraldsun/ms-icon-144x144.png", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Colourful rich-lister Mark Cuban has hit back at a critic who described a diamond company he backs as nothing more than a scam.", "keywords": "diamond company, synthetic diamond, synthetic diamond company, claim diamond company, third-party chemistry labs, billionaire investor, grieving families pay, Shark Tank, jewellery industry, gem expert, synthetic diamonds, Laguna Beach, California, United States of America, Northern America, North America, America, Getty Images Inc., New York Post Company, Agence France Presse, Diamond Producers Association, Grant Mobley, Mark Cuban, Oli Coleman", "generator": "tcog", "articleid": "a8481a16f867c6aa258a5bff3106993a", "article": {"published_time": "2019-12-30T00:59:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2019-12-30T00:59:58.000Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theheraldsun", "title": "Billionaire\u2019s company slammed as a \u2018scam\u2019", "description": "Billionaire Mark \u00adCuban is punching back against a gem expert who called one of his companies \u201cnothing more than a scam\u201d.", "image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9053f5612167c4d6e65119223bd761fb"}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Billionaire\u2019s company slammed as a \u2018scam\u2019", "description": "Billionaire Mark \u00adCuban is punching back against a gem expert who called one of his companies \u201cnothing more than a scam\u201d.", "url": "https://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/companies/us-richlister-mark-cuban-defends-synthetic-diamond-company-eterneva/news-story/a8481a16f867c6aa258a5bff3106993a", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9053f5612167c4d6e65119223bd761fb", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "vr": {"canonical": "https://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/companies/us-richlister-mark-cuban-defends-synthetic-diamond-company-eterneva/news-story/a8481a16f867c6aa258a5bff3106993a"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/us-richlister-mark-cuban-defends-synthetic-diamond-company-eterneva/news-story/a8481a16f867c6aa258a5bff3106993a"}
