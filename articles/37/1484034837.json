Below is an excerpt from the article.\n\nKleverness proudly bills its products as \u201cthe best, easiest and smartest solution for your home\u2019s lighting.\u201d I can categorically tell you that none of those claims are accurate, and that today Kleverness is not worth serious consideration if you want to outfit your home with smart lights.\n\nThe hockey puck-sized Klever Hub requires just the ethernet hookup and a power connection, and then you\u2019re ready to connect via the Kleverness app to get things going. Or so I thought. After registering your name, email address, and a password with the app, you must wait for a confirmation code to be delivered via email before you can proceed. I registered and waited\u2026 and waited\u2026 and it wasn\u2019t until nearly an hour later that my confirmation code finally arrived, after which time I had already created a new account with a different email address. This time the code landed in a spam folder, another aggravation.\n\nThe next step in setup is to scan a QR code on the underside of the Hub to register it to the app. I scanned, and the connection failed. I tried twice again, same result. After unplugging the Hub and plugging it back in, I tried a fourth time. The app crashed. The fifth try turned out to be the charm.\n\nAfter a lengthy firmware update, I was finally ready to get started adding Kleverness components. Marketed as a smart lighting solution, Kleverness does not sell light bulbs. Instead, it sells an in-wall switch, an in-wall dimmer, and a plug-in outlet. The system\u2019s goal is not to give you tunable lighting options but rather a way to control the lights you already have. Note that all this gear requires the Klever Hub to work.\n\nIt may come as no surprise to hear that the Kleverness app crashed over and over again when I was setting up these devices (more QR codes to be scanned), requiring multiple force-quits of the app and power cycling the Hub before I finally got anything to work. All told, I spent 2.5 hours working with the Kleverness system to get just one plug-in outlet working.\n\nRead more...", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Kleverness Smart Lighting review: This hub-based lighting system is unfinished and expensive"], "tags": ["BUTTIGIEG", "BIDEN", "SANDERS", "CORONAVIRUS", "BREAKING", "TRUMP", "SPYGATE"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Smart light switches and dimmers are often superior to smart light bulbs, but the Kleverness system is most certainly not.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Kleverness Smart Lighting review: This hub-based lighting system is unfinished and expensive", "description": "Smart light switches and dimmers are often superior to smart light bulbs, but the Kleverness system is most certainly not.", "google-site-verification": "tFwban02zfqaKeK05Mkgz89TdOounWhx71cOQcw8qKY", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "noodp", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Kleverness Smart Lighting review: This hub-based lighting system is unfinished and expensive", "description": "Smart light switches and dimmers are often superior to smart light bulbs, but the Kleverness system is most certainly not.", "url": "https://www.thenewscommenter.com/news/Kleverness-Smart-Lighting-review-This-hub-based-lighting-system-is-unfinished-and-expensive/1252496", "type": "website", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thenewscommenter.com/images/uploads/upload157787730466611_thumb.jpg", "width": 450, "height": 298}, "site_name": "The News Commenter"}, "fb": {"app_id": 286353854823765}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newscommenter", "creator": "@newscommenter", "title": "Kleverness Smart Lighting review: This hub-based lighting system is unfinished and expensive", "description": "Smart light switches and dimmers are often superior to smart light bulbs, but the Kleverness system is most certainly not.", "image": "https://www.thenewscommenter.com/images/uploads/upload157787730466611_thumb.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thenewscommenter.com/news/Kleverness-Smart-Lighting-review-This-hub-based-lighting-system-is-unfinished-and-expensive/1252496"}
