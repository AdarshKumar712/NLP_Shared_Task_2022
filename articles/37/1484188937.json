While we won't know many of the details until the week of the show, it looks like there will be plenty happening in the gaming industry, including new PC components, accessories and ways to make video games more immersive with augmented reality, virtual reality and haptic technology.\n\nHere's some of what we expect to see at CES 2020.\n\nRead more: CES 2020 preview: PCs, laptops, tablets and gaming\n\nWhat should we be on the lookout for from major companies?\n\nWe could see announcements from Intel, AMD and Nvidia, which could come with new CPUs or GPUs. Last year, Nvidia's 2080 graphics card series for laptops garnered a lot of attention at the show. New gaming PCs could be on the horizon from Alienware, Dell's in-house gaming brand, HP, Asus and others. Last year, for example, Alienware released the 17-inch m17 gaming laptop alongside an updated m15. Razer also typically has some gaming surprises -- last year, it unveiled the Razer Blade 15 Advanced laptop, and a new concept design for a high-end gaming display.\n\nNew gaming components for PC and console\n\nIogear could have some new gamer accessories for PCs, particularly keyboards, mice, headsets, emulators and more. Looking around the show floor map, we see Shenzen companies such as GCHT Gaming, which specializes in game controllers, and Gamtec Technology Development, Mijoy and Riitek, which offer products like gaming accessories for PC, PS4, Xbox, Switch and Android.\n\nVirtual reality and immersive gaming through haptics\n\nCybershoes\n\nAt CES 2020, we can expect to see technology that further immerses players in video games -- like Cybershoes that let you \"walk and run\" in a virtual reality game. You'll be able to feel the game around you with BHaptic's wireless full-body haptic suit -- Tactsuit -- which is comprised of a haptic HMDS, a vest and sleeves for the hands, arms and feet. You'll be able to feel samurai slashes, gunshots, zombie bites and hugs in VR content in the Oculus store and on Steam, according to BHaptics. The gear looks like a cross between the suits found in Pacific Rim and Ready Player One.\n\nWhile on the topic of haptics, if a suit isn't your style, Arcadeo has a haptic gaming chair that you can control with a mobile app. GT Throne is also bringing a sleek, interactive gaming chair that vibrates to audio.\n\nImmersion Corporation also has haptics tech to show off, and is looking to \"revolutionize human-machine interface in a digital world.\" Some of Immersion's features for mobile gaming focus on AR and VR, in terms of making games more tactile, using filters and more.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that many products on display at CES never actually come to market, so don't get too excited just yet.\n\nExpanding the senses\n\nIn addition to vibrations and VR, sound plays a big part in making a game more immersive. Flexound is going to show off its Augmented Audio tech, which adds the sensation of touch to audio-visual listening experiences like music, games, television, movies and more. While it seems like Augmented Audio is focused on moviegoers, we could see it migrate into gaming chairs in the future.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Intel", "Microsoft", "virtual reality", "Dell's", "Notification on Notification off Dell", "Nvidia", "Asus", "Razer", "HP"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Gaming PCs will get faster, smaller and smarter.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/cnetcss/images/core/icon/apple-touch-icon-57.png", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#B80000", "author": "Shelby Brown", "description": "Gaming PCs will get faster, smaller and smarter.", "og": {"site_name": "CNET", "title": "CES 2020 gaming predictions: Virtual reality, haptics and more hardware we expect", "description": "Gaming PCs will get faster, smaller and smarter.", "image": "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/KqAqs1_Nha7_lT-W5VgUK9LgKSc=/756x567/2019/04/22/9e71d9a6-6713-4c23-b834-8cb62029454e/razer-blade-15-advanced-2019-promo-02.jpg", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/news/ces-2020-gaming-predictions-virtual-reality-haptics-and-more-hardware-we-expect/"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Forums; action-uri=http://forums.cnet.com/; icon-uri=https://www.cnet.com/favicon.ico", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/cnetcss/images/core/icon/mstile-144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/cnetcss/images/core/icon/mstile-70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/cnetcss/images/core/icon/mstile-150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/cnetcss/images/core/icon/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/cnetcss/images/core/icon/mstile-310.png", "fb": {"app_id": 16995676698, "admins": 100001036810388, "pages": 7155422274}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnet", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 30261067, "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/news/ces-2020-gaming-predictions-virtual-reality-haptics-and-more-hardware-we-expect/", "title": "CES 2020 gaming predictions: Virtual reality, haptics and more hardware we expect", "description": "Gaming PCs will get faster, smaller and smarter.", "image": "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/KqAqs1_Nha7_lT-W5VgUK9LgKSc=/756x567/2019/04/22/9e71d9a6-6713-4c23-b834-8cb62029454e/razer-blade-15-advanced-2019-promo-02.jpg", "site": "@CNET", "creator": "@shelbybrown91"}, "google-site-verification": "wNWLoFvk5wsdZQ-u75uCNiaHNa7FLFmNtH2t7dZbXmQ", "p": {"domain_verify": "47524839a64b83c951afca9ef6c838e0"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-tooltip": "Product reviews and prices, software downloads, and tech news - CNET", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.cnet.com/", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#424244", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "dell, inc., dell, hp, laptops, razer inc."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.cnet.com/news/ces-2020-gaming-predictions-virtual-reality-haptics-and-more-hardware-we-expect/"}
