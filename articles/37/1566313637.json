With the history unraveling in my city. Impacting in the mundane minutia of my life.\n\nThe whole thing unfolded in rapid slow motion. First there was the pure \u201cinternational news\u201d item. A place in China most have never heard of. Wet markets and the harsh boot of government. Fuss about the travel restrictions snowballing. The panic about catching colds on planes. From that it accelerated to curfews, working from home, client accounts dying.\n\nNow it IS a global economic depression.\n\nWhat shocks me are people talking about \u201cgetting back\u201d to \u201cnormal\u201d. I\u2019m not sure how the people who think they can survive it will make it through. The normal predictabilities of the past are gone.\n\nThe time called \u201cwhen this is over\u201d is on the other side of an unknown. What state we\u2019ll be in when this passes is speculation. That unknown is the scariest IF you want to waste energy in the futility of speculation.\n\nThere is hope : the only reason economic activity has stopped is because of the disease. Not because a bunch of people put money they didn\u2019t have on a Ponzi scheme. When the COVID19 crisis has passed, the motive for that activity will be released. The awakening will have its own pace.\n\nI\u2019ll be happy to crawl out with the health and safety of everyone intact.
