the bell. She\u2019s still wearing her school uniform, but she\u2019s taken off the sweater, so it\u2019s just the blouse and skirt, and she has no shoes on, only tights.\n\nOh, hey, he says.\n\nCome on in.\n\nShe turns and walks down the hall. He follows her, closing the door behind him. Down a few steps in the kitchen, his mother Lorraine is peeling off a pair of rubber gloves. Marianne hops onto the countertop and picks up an open jar of chocolate spread, in which she has left a teaspoon.\n\nMarianne was telling me you got your mock results today, Lorraine says.\n\nWe got English back, he says. They come back separately. Do you want to head on?\n\nLorraine folds the rubber gloves up neatly and replaces them below the sink. Then she starts unclipping her hair. To Connell this seems like something she could accomplish in the car.\n\nAnd I hear you did very well, she says.\n\nHe was top of the class, says Marianne.\n\nRight, Connell says. Marianne did pretty good too. Can we go?\n\nLorraine pauses in the untying of her apron.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize we were in a rush, she says.\n\nHe puts his hands in his pockets and suppresses an irritable sigh, but suppresses it with an audible intake of breath, so that it still sounds like a sigh.\n\nI just have to pop up and take a load out of the dryer, says Lorraine. And then we\u2019ll be off. Okay?\n\nHe says nothing, merely hanging his head while Lorraine leaves the room.\n\nDo you want some of this? Marianne says.\n\nShe\u2019s holding out the jar of chocolate spread. He presses his hands down slightly further into his pockets, as if trying to store his entire body in his pockets all at once.\n\nNo, thanks, he says.\n\nDid you get your French results today?\n\nYesterday.\n\nHe puts his back against the fridge and watches her lick the spoon. In school he and Marianne affect not to know each other. People know that Marianne lives in the white mansion with the driveway and that Connell\u2019s mother is a cleaner, but no one knows of the special relationship between these facts.\n\nI got an A1, he says. What did you get in German?\n\nAn A1, she says. Are you bragging?\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re going to get six hundred, are you?\n\nShe shrugs. You probably will, she says.\n\nWell, you\u2019re smarter than me.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t feel bad. I\u2019m smarter than everyone.\n\nMarianne is grinning now. She exercises an open contempt for people in school. She has no friends and spends her lunchtimes alone reading novels. A lot of people really hate her. Her father died when she was thirteen and Connell has heard she has a mental illness now or something. It\u2019s true she is the smartest person in school. He dreads being left alone with her like this, but he also finds himself fantasizing about things he could say to impress her.\n\nYou\u2019re not top of the class in English, he points out.\n\nShe licks her teeth, unconcerned.\n\nMaybe you should give me grinds, Connell, she says.\n\nHe feels his ears get hot. She\u2019s probably just being glib and not suggestive, but if she is being suggestive it\u2019s only to degrade him by association, since she is considered an object of disgust. She wears ugly thick-soled flat shoes and doesn\u2019t put makeup on her face. People have said she doesn\u2019t shave her legs or anything. Connell once heard that she spilled chocolate ice cream on herself in the school lunchroom, and she went to the girls\u2019 bathrooms and took her blouse off to wash it in the sink. That\u2019s a popular story about her, everyone has heard it. If she wanted, she could make a big show of saying hello to Connell in school. See you this afternoon, she could say, in front of everyone. Undoubtedly it would put him in an awkward position, which is the kind of thing she usually seems to enjoy. But she has never done it.\n\nWhat were you talking to Miss Neary about today? says Marianne.\n\nOh. Nothing. I don\u2019t know. Exams.\n\nMarianne twists the spoon around inside the jar.\n\nDoes she fancy you or something? Marianne says.\n\nConnell watches her moving the spoon. His ears still feel very hot.\n\nWhy do you say that? he says.\n\nGod, you\u2019re not having an affair with her, are you?\n\nObviously not. Do you think it\u2019s funny joking about that?\n\nSorry, says Marianne.\n\nShe has a focused expression, like she\u2019s looking through his eyes into the back of his head.\n\nYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s not funny, she says. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nHe nods, looks around the room for a bit, digs the toe of his shoe into a groove between the tiles.\n\nSometimes I feel like she does act kind of weird around me, he says. But I wouldn\u2019t say that to people or anything.\n\nEven in class I think she\u2019s very flirtatious toward you.\n\nDo you really think that?\n\nMarianne nods. He rubs at his neck. Miss Neary teaches Economics. His supposed feelings for her are widely discussed in school. Some people are even saying that he tried to add her on Facebook, which he didn\u2019t and would never do. Actually he doesn\u2019t do or say anything to her, he just sits there quietly while she does and says things to him. She keeps him back after class sometimes to talk about his life direction, and once she actually touched the knot of his school tie. He can\u2019t tell people about the way she acts because they\u2019ll think he\u2019s trying to brag about it. In class he feels too embarrassed and annoyed to concentrate on the lesson, he just sits there staring at the textbook until the bar graphs start to blur.\n\nPeople are always going on at me that I fancy her or whatever, he says. But I actually don\u2019t, at all. I mean, you don\u2019t think I\u2019m playing into it when she acts like that, do you?\n\nNot that I\u2019ve seen.\n\nHe wipes his palms down on his school shirt unthinkingly. Everyone is so convinced of his attraction to Miss Neary that sometimes he starts to doubt his own instincts about it. What if, at some level above or below his own perception, he does actually desire her? He doesn\u2019t even really know what desire is supposed to feel like. Any time he has had sex in real life, he has found it so stressful as to be largely unpleasant, leading him to suspect that there\u2019s something wrong with him, that he\u2019s unable to be intimate with women, that he\u2019s somehow developmentally impaired. He lies there afterward and thinks: I hated that so much that I feel sick. Is that just the way he is? Is the nausea he feels when Miss Neary leans over his desk actually his way of experiencing a sexual thrill? How would he know?\n\nI could go to Mr. Lyons for you if you want, says Marianne. I won\u2019t say you told me anything, I\u2019ll just say I noticed it myself.\n\nJesus, no. Definitely not. Don\u2019t say anything about it to anyone, okay?\n\nOkay, all right.\n\nHe looks at her to confirm she\u2019s being serious, and then nods.\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault she acts like that with you, says Marianne. You\u2019re not doing anything wrong.\n\nQuietly he says: Why does everyone else think I fancy her, then?\n\nMaybe because you blush a lot when she talks to you. But you know, you blush at everything, you just have that complexion.\n\nHe gives a short, unhappy laugh. Thanks, he says.\n\nWell, you do.\n\nYeah, I\u2019m aware.\n\nYou\u2019re blushing now actually, says Marianne.\n\nHe closes his eyes, pushes his tongue against the roof of his mouth. He can hear Marianne laughing.\n\nWhy do you have to be so harsh on people? he says.\n\nI\u2019m not being harsh. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re blushing, I won\u2019t tell anyone.\n\nJust because you won\u2019t tell people doesn\u2019t mean you can say whatever you want.\n\n\n\nOkay, she says. Sorry.\n\nHe turns and looks out the window at the garden. Really the garden is more like \u201cgrounds.\u201d It includes a tennis court and a large stone statue in the shape of a woman. He looks out at the \u201cgrounds\u201d and moves his face close to the cool breath of the glass. When people tell that story about Marianne washing her blouse in the sink, they act like it\u2019s just funny, but Connell thinks the real purpose of the story is something else. Marianne has never been with anyone in school, no one has ever seen her undressed, no one even knows if she likes boys or girls, she won\u2019t tell anyone. People resent that about her, and Connell thinks that\u2019s why they tell the story, as a way of gawking at something they\u2019re not allowed to see.\n\nI don\u2019t want to get into a fight with you, she says.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Sally Rooney", "Follow The Author", "Abqa"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Normal People: A Novel [Rooney, Sally] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers.
