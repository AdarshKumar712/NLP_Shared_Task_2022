That has an impact on infrastructure.\u201d\n\nInfrastructure in Siberia, northern Canada and Alaska is usually built on pillars that stand on top of the permafrost. With temperatures rising at twice the global average rate in the Arctic Circle, the frozen ground is thawing and causing cracks in roads and buildings.\n\nAbout half of Russia, the world\u2019s largest country, is covered with permafrost. But while Russian scientists have developed ways to refreeze the ground in cases where structural stability is at stake, they lag North America in preparing for a future with no permafrost at all.\n\nMany of Russia\u2019s settlements in the Far North are shrinking as harsh conditions and economic isolation drive people to leave. Vorkuta, a former gulag coal mine set up by Joseph Stalin and the country\u2019s third-biggest city in the Arctic Circle, has lost more than half of its population since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nMMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC \u2014 a Russian metals mining company named after an Arctic city so isolated that residents refer to the rest of Russia as the mainland \u2014 is the parent company of the power plant responsible for the leaking diesel reservoir. President Vladimir Putin on Friday chastised Norilsk Nickel\u2019s billionaire owner, Vladimir Potanin, for failing to upgrade the 30-year-old tank before the leak and ordered authorities to review the condition of similar facilities around the country.\n\nThe spill, which Potanin estimates will cost his company at least 10 billion rubles ($146 million) to clean up, is the largest ever in the Arctic region, according to Greenpeace. The environmental group likened it to the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989, when 37,000 tons of crude oil leaked from an oil tanker off the coast of Alaska.\n\nThe spill has been contained and some 200 tons of fuel have been collected, Emergencies Minister Yevgeny Zinichev said Friday.\n\nCleaning the area won\u2019t be easy and the accident will likely damage the permafrost over the longer term, according to Grosse. Diesel lowers the freezing point for water, which could accelerate thawing even more, he said.\n\nA heat wave in Siberia resulted in temperatures as high as 10 degrees Celsius above the May average in some areas, according to a report by Europe\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service. The warm weather plus low precipitation have dried out vegetation earlier than usual and reignited fires still smoldering from last year.\n\nBoth the fires and the thawing are releasing hundreds of tons of carbon dioxide that has been entrapped in the tundra for thousands of years. Grosse estimates that 1,700 gigatons of carbon dioxide is trapped in permafrost, or twice the amount currently in the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cPermafrost contains organic matter that never decomposed, so when it thaws, that organic matter starts decomposing, bacteria eat it and in the process they release greenhouse gases, mainly methane and carbon dioxide,\u201d Grosse said. \u201cAll of that accelerates global warming.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["pollution", "Russia", "oil", "Climate change", "Arctic", "environment", "permafrost", "oil spills"], "tags": ["environment", "Climate change", "oil", "oil spills", "Russia", "pollution", "permafrost", "Arctic"], "authors": ["Internal Submission"], "publish_date": "Mon Jun  8 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "With temperatures rising at twice the global average rate in the Arctic Circle, the frozen ground is thawing and causing cracks in roads and buildings.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/wp-content/themes/jt_theme/library/img/japantimes-favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"verify-v1": "+h35BdFddo/f1upXot92yGKSB4d5EuWWGbARz9SJE6A=", "twitter": {"account_id": 7424642, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "With temperatures rising at twice the global average rate in the Arctic Circle, the frozen ground is thawing and causing cracks in roads and buildings.", "title": "Giant diesel spill in Russia offers glimpse of Arctic\u2019s future | The Japan Times", "site": "@japantimes", "image": "https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/np_file_16673.jpeg", "creator": "@japantimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Japan Times", "robots": "noodp", "author": "Internal Submission", "article": {"author": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/author/woodwing/", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thejapantimes", "tag": "oil spills"}, "thumbnail": "https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/np_file_16673-200x200.jpeg", "description": "With temperatures rising at twice the global average rate in the Arctic Circle, the frozen ground is thawing and causing cracks in roads and buildings.", "keywords": "pollution, Russia, oil, Climate change, Arctic, environment, permafrost, oil spills", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Giant diesel spill in Russia offers glimpse of Arctic\u2019s future | The Japan Times", "description": "With temperatures rising at twice the global average rate in the Arctic Circle, the frozen ground is thawing and causing cracks in roads and buildings.", "url": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/06/08/world/science-health-world/giant-diesel-spill-russia-offers-glimpse-arctics-future/", "site_name": "The Japan Times", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/np_file_16673-870x489.jpeg", "width": 870, "height": 489}}, "fb": {"app_id": 119406745111}, "DC.date.issued": "2020-06-08T14:10:44+09:00"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/06/08/world/science-health-world/giant-diesel-spill-russia-offers-glimpse-arctics-future/"}
