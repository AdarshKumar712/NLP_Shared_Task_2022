None of the urban local bodies (ULBs) in state could make it to the top 1,000 ULBs in the first two quarters under the Swachh Survekshan League.The results were announced by Union minister of state for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday. The performance of cities in SS League is crucial to their rankings in the annual Swachh Survekshan 2020 as 25% weightage of the quarterly assessments will be included in the annual survey scheduled to be conducted from January 4 to 31.As per the results announced on Tuesday, the bottom four cities with population above 10 lakh were Patna (ranked 46), Delhi (47), Howrah (48) and Kolkata (49). But technically, Patna was the second last as none of the West Bengal cities participated in the survey and hence scored zero.Though Sahebganj ULB in Muzaffarpur was the best in state, but it still ranked 1,388, followed by Muzaffarpur and Danapur with 1,457 and 2,723 ranks respectively. An official with the urban development and housing department said the marks will have slight impact on the final survey starting from January 4. \u201cThe entire marks for the survey is 6,000, but SS League 2020 consists of only 1,500 marks and that too only 25% of it will be carried forward. Another 1500 marks each will be on the direct observation, citizens\u2019 feedback and service level programme, which will make to total of 4,500,\u201d he said.\u201cWe do not expect much improvement in the final survey as we lack manpower required for the evaluation,\u201d the official added.State urban development and housing department minister Suresh Kumar Sharma said the department will now focus on improving the ULBs\u2019 rankings in Bihar . \u201cIt is our New Year pledge to perform better from now onwards. We have already bought many equipment for cleanliness and the result can be seen from this month,\u201d said Sharma.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Patna news", "Patna latest news", "Patna news live", "Patna news today", "Today news Patna", "Swachh survey", "Patna Municipal Corporation", "patna in Swachh survey ranking", "first two quarters of Swachh survey", "Bihar"], "tags": ["Delhi Air Pollution", "Fire in Mumbai", "Mumbai Rains", "Patna Municipal Corporation", "Hyderabad Rain", "Bangalore Temperature", "Delhi Temperature", "Srinagar encounter", "Chennai Weather", "Delhi Smog"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Patna Municipal Corporation was fourth lowest among the cities having population above 10 lakhs in the Swachh Survekshan results for the first two", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Patna Municipal Corporation was fourth lowest among the cities having population above 10 lakhs in the Swachh Survekshan results for the first two", "keywords": "Patna news, Patna latest news, Patna news live, Patna news today, Today news Patna,Swachh survey,Patna Municipal Corporation,patna in Swachh survey ranking,first two quarters of Swachh survey,Bihar", "robots": "NOODP", "og": {"title": "Patna fourth lowest in first two quarters of Swachh survey | Patna News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/patna-4th-lowest-in-first-two-quarters-of-swachh-survey/articleshow/73061814.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73066031,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-635610,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "The Patna Municipal Corporation was fourth lowest among the cities having population above 10 lakhs in the Swachh Survekshan results for the first two", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/patna-4th-lowest-in-first-two-quarters-of-swachh-survey/articleshow/73061814.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73066031,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-635610,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "Patna fourth lowest in first two quarters of Swachh survey | Patna News - Times of India", "description": "The Patna Municipal Corporation was fourth lowest among the cities having population above 10 lakhs in the Swachh Survekshan results for the first two", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "news_keywords": "Swachh survey,Patna Municipal Corporation,patna in Swachh survey ranking,first two quarters of Swachh survey,Bihar", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/patna-4th-lowest-in-first-two-quarters-of-swachh-survey/articleshow/73061814.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 227797153941209, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/patna-4th-lowest-in-first-two-quarters-of-swachh-survey/articleshow/73061814.cms"}
