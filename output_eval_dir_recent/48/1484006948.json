Now, months after the end of the war, Thor has rebuilt his home. Gone are the shimmering golden palaces of his father's creation, with the seat of the king remade in wood and stone. But now what was once a golden paradise, remade into a medieval city, shaped by hammers... has just been rocked by the arrival of Galactus in Marvel's shocking Thor #1.\n\nAs Thor readies himself to give his first speech to the Asgardians gathered around their new king -- a message readers can only assume would have reflected the same message sent by the remade land itself, Galactus comes plummeting down from the sky, smashing directly into city's inhabitants, and Thor instantly realizing that scores of his people will never get the chance to hear a speech ever again.\n\nContinue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view.\n\nRelated: Thor Takes His Hammer To Galactus in New Comic Cover\n\nThe sight of Galactus wrapped in machine armor, decimating the crowd is a horrifying one, to be sure. Screams are heard, as bolts of lightning mark Thor's leap into the fight, prepared to kill Galactus for this invasion of his people's new home. Thankfully Thor has the presence of mind to stop before then, stopping short as Galactus pleads with Thor to understand the reason for his arrival. He has come to Asgard for help, since Thor is the only one who can stop the Great Black Winter. The newest unknown threat to Thor (and all life in the universe), and one that can only be stopped if Thor becomes the newest herald of Galactus.\n\nRight on cue the mourning rains of Asgard begin to fall, carrying on for weeks. The city officials of Asgard work, busying themselves with counting the dead and calculating the cost of Galactus's 'arrival.' And while they may try to ignore the silence of their new king, it is evident more than just Asgard's people died the day Galactus fell. Galactus' impact also means that Yggdrasil, the tree of life, has begun to die. How will thor possibly manage to correct these tragedies, and return to his brighter vision for Asgard's future? To have those questions answered, readers will need to pick up Thor #1!
