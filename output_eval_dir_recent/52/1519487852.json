Total Solar International will have a 65% interest in the JV, while Powetis will hold the rest.\n\nInitially, for the new JV, Powertis has agreed to bring in 800MW portfolio of early-stage projects. The JV will also develop new projects in the future.\n\nAccording to the agreement with Solarbay, Total Solar International is set to acquire a portfolio of 1.2GW solar PV projects.\n\n\n\nThe companies have not disclosed the financial details of the deal.\n\nSolarbay is developing the solar PV projects. The new facilities will be built in Andalusia, Aragon and Castile-La Mancha regions.\n\nThe UK left the European Union on 31 January. Do you think this will be a positive or a negative for the UK power industry? Strongly positive\n\nSlightly positive\n\nNeutral\n\nSlightly negative\n\nStrongly negative View Results\n\nLoading ...

Its photovoltaic market is one of the most dynamic in Europe, with an expected capacity increase from 6GW to nearly 40GW by 2030.\n\n\u201cTotal is pleased to enter this fast-growing market through partnerships with local developers.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Total acquired a 50% stake in Indian conglomerate Adani Group\u2019s solar business for $510m, as it seeks to expand its renewable energy sources portfolio.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Feb 12 10:44:32 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Total\u2019s wholly owned affiliate Total Solar International has signed two agreements with Powertis and Solarbay Renewable Energy to develop approximately 2GW of solar projects in Spain..", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/09/power-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=1", "pocket-site-verification": "efe18a5e1c79d546d730e18cf75a21", "description": "Total\u2019s wholly owned affiliate Total Solar International has signed two agreements with Powertis and Solarbay Renewable Energy to develop approximately 2GW of solar projects in Spain..", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Total signs agreements to develop 2GW of solar projects in Spain", "description": "Total\u2019s wholly owned affiliate Total Solar International has signed two agreements with Powertis and Solarbay Renewable Energy to develop approximately 2GW of solar projects in Spain..", "url": "https://www.power-technology.com/news/total-solar-projects-spain/", "site_name": "Power Technology | Energy News and Market Analysis", "updated_time": "2020-02-12T10:44:33+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2020/02/mariana-proenca-GXiHwHkIdVs-unsplash1.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2020/02/mariana-proenca-GXiHwHkIdVs-unsplash1.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 600}}, "article": {"tag": "Featured", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-02-12T10:44:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-12T10:44:33+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Total\u2019s wholly owned affiliate Total Solar International has signed two agreements with Powertis and Solarbay Renewable Energy to develop approximately 2GW of solar projects in Spain..", "title": "Total signs agreements to develop 2GW of solar projects in Spain", "image": "https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2020/02/mariana-proenca-GXiHwHkIdVs-unsplash1.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.power-technology.com/news/total-solar-projects-spain/"}
