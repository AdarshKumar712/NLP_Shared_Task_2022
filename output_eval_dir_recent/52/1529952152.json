Kansas also was atop the poll for one week in December, when it seemed as if just about every school that ascended to No. 1 promptly lost in a topsy-turvy start to the season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a silent team that can make a run late in March,\u201d Jayhawks guard Devon Dotson said after the 64-61 victory on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get complacent from this one. We\u2019re going to build off of it.\u201d\n\nBaylor (24-2, 13-1) received two first-place votes and fell to second after its 23-game winning streak came to an end. Gonzaga was No. 3 after a loss to BYU, and Dayton jumped San Diego State for No. 4 after the Aztecs lost for the first time in a week when every team in the top 10 found itself in a new position from last week.\n\nThe most notable change, of course, came at the top.\n\n\u201cBaylor is the best team that we\u2019ve played against since I\u2019ve been in the league the last 17 years,\u201d said Jayhawks coach Bill Self, whose team begins its four-game finishing stretch against Oklahoma State on Monday night. \u201cYou could look at Oklahoma State in \u201904 and you could look at (Texas) Tech in \u201919, but I think Baylor has played better than both those teams at the same stage. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to finish, but I certainly feel strongly about that.\u201d\n\nBaylor coach Scott Drew, whose team spent five weeks at No. 1, was equally effusive in his praise for the Jayhawks.\n\n\u201cKansas has really progressed since the last time we faced them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a heck of a run. I never thought I\u2019d see anyone do what we did. The Big 12 is so tough. Six straight years we\u2019ve been the number one conference for a reason.\u201d\n\nBaylor wasn\u2019t the only team to take its lumps during an upset-filled weekend.\n\nThe Cougars continued their climb to No. 17 after they knocked off Gonzaga on Saturday night, while UNLV ended the Aztecs\u2019 perfect start with a 66-63 victory. Two more top-10 teams went down in a Big Ten shakeup Sunday when Maryland lost to Ohio State and Penn State lost to Indiana for its second defeat of the week.\n\n\u201cWe lost, and it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s happened (this season), so it doesn\u2019t feel good,\u201d San Diego State guard Malachi Flynn said. \u201cWe were all just trying to win the game, and it\u2019s just played out the way it played out.\u201d\n\nThe Flyers (25-2) have won 16 straight to reach their highest standing in the poll since finishing third during the 1955-56 season, while the Aztecs (26-1) remain the nation\u2019s only one-loss Division I team. They were followed by Florida State, Duke, Kentucky, Maryland and Creighton in rounding out the top 10.\n\nThe Seminoles climbed two spots ahead of their high-profile ACC showdown with No. 11 Louisville on Monday night.

Their streak has moved them to within a game of Seton Hall \u2014 which climbed from No. 16 to No. 13 this week \u2014 in what has become an intrigue race for the Big East title.\n\nThe biggest jump this week came from BYU, which followed a victory over Santa Clara with a resounding 91-78 win over Gonzaga. The Cougars climbed six spots to No. 17 with their eighth straight victory.\n\nPenn State took the biggest tumble from ninth to No. 16 after losses to Illinois and Indiana, while West Virginia fell three spots to No. 20 and Colorado dropped three spots to No. 21.\n\nIN AND OUT\n\nMichigan shot back into the Top 25 at No. 19 this week after the Wolverines ran their winning streak to five straight and seven of eight with victories at Purdue and Rutgers. Texas Tech and Michigan State also returned to the poll with the Red Raiders at No. 22 and the Spartans at No. 24.\n\nMarquette tumbled from No. 19 all the way out after losing to Creighton and unranked Providence. Butler fell out from No. 21 and Arizona from No. 24 after the Wildcats lost in overtime to Oregon on Saturday.\n\nAP college basketball poll\n\nTeam Record Points Pvs. 1. Kansas 24-3 1,598 3 2.
