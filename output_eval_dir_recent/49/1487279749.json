AZPM\n\nFor the first time, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is sending asylum seekers back to Nogales, Sonora, to wait for their cases to proceed through the U.S. asylum system. It\u2019s part of the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as the \u201cRemain In Mexico\u201d program.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the first group of 18 asylum seekers were sent back to Nogales, said CBP spokeswoman Meredith Mingledorff. She could not say how many would be sent back going forward.\n\n\u201cAs people come through and are determined eligible for that program, that\u2019s what will determine whether or not they are sent back,\u201d she said.\n\nLate last year, CBP announced asylum seekers apprehended in the Tucson Sector, which includes much of Arizona\u2019s border with Mexico, would be sent back to wait in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas.\n\nNow, asylum seekers will also be sent to Mexico through the Nogales Port of Entry \u2014 the seventh port of entry to be included in the program, and the first in Arizona \u2014 according to a Department of Homeland Security news release.\n\nThe agency decided to expand the program because it believes migrants were crossing the border into Arizona to avoid being sent back to Mexico, Mingledorff said.\n\n\u201cSo it was a factor in migration patterns. And they wanted to take that away and say, \u2018OK, that\u2019s not going to be an option here anymore. If you come here and you\u2019re eligible, then you will be returned to Mexico,\u201d she said.\n\nMore than 56,000 people have been sent back to border cities in Mexico since January 2019, through ports in and around San Diego, Calexico, El Paso, Laredo, Brownsville, and Eagle Pass, according to the DHS release. The agency called the \u201cRemain In Mexico\u201d program \u201ca cornerstone\u201d of its efforts to address an overburdened immigration system.\n\n\u201cMPP has been an extremely effective tool as the United States, under the leadership of President Trump, continues to address the ongoing humanitarian and security crisis at the border,\u201d acting Secretary Chad Wolf was quoted as saying.\n\nMigrant advocates, however, have said that the program puts vulnerable asylum seekers into dangerous situations in Mexico.\n\n\u201cThe three major concerns are health, shelter and access to the support they need to continue their cases,\u201d said Joanna Williams, education and advocacy director with the Kino Border Initiative, which works with migrants and asylum seekers on both sides of the border in Nogales. \u201cIt\u2019s less than freezing every night here in Nogales. It\u2019s particularly troubling as far as the humanitarian situation folks will be in, because they very well could be sleeping outside in below-freezing temperatures.\u201d\n\nWilliams said there is a lack of planning and coordination in Nogales to provide asylum seekers with shelter and other resources they need as they wait for their court dates. And there are already thousands of people in Nogales waiting to ask for asylum at the port of entry. The wait for most is at least four months right now, Williams said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not even sure where people are going to sleep at night,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, what we\u2019ve seen in other border cities is that the longer MPP is around \u2014 the more many dozens and hundreds of people are returned \u2014 the more chaotic, dangerous and problematic the situation becomes.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["asylum seekers mexico", "mpp", "migrant protection protocols", "US asylum", "trump immigration policy", "asylum process", "Southern Arizona news", "Tucson news", "AZPM news"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Fronteras Desk", "Kendal Blust"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The agency said it expanded the program because it believes migrants were crossing into Arizona to avoid being sent back to Mexico.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://media.azpm.org/master/doc/icons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The agency said it expanded the program because it believes migrants were crossing into Arizona to avoid being sent back to Mexico.", "news_keywords": "asylum seekers mexico, mpp, migrant protection protocols, US asylum, trump immigration policy, asylum process", "keywords": "asylum seekers mexico, mpp, migrant protection protocols, US asylum, trump immigration policy, asylum process, Southern Arizona news, Tucson news, AZPM news", "article": {"modified": "jan 2, 2020 3:39 p.m."}, "author": "Fronteras Desk", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "First migrants returned to Nogales, Sonora, under \u2018Remain In Mexico\u2019", "url": "https://news.azpm.org/p/news-topical-border/2020/1/2/163683-first-migrants-returned-to-nogales-sonora-under-remain-in-mexico/", "description": "The agency said it expanded the program because it believes migrants were crossing into Arizona to avoid being sent back to Mexico.", "image": "https://media.azpm.org/master/image/2019/4/10/spot/episode-summary.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@azpm", "creator": "@azpm", "title": "First migrants returned to Nogales, Sonora, under \u2018Remain In Mexico\u2019 - AZPM", "description": "The agency said it expanded the program because it believes migrants were crossing into Arizona to avoid being sent back to Mexico.", "image": "https://media.azpm.org/master/image/2019/4/10/spot/episode-summary.jpg"}, "msapplication-config": "https://media.azpm.org/master/doc/icons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "canonical_link": "https://news.azpm.org/p/news-topical-border/2020/1/2/163683-first-migrants-returned-to-nogales-sonora-under-remain-in-mexico/"}
