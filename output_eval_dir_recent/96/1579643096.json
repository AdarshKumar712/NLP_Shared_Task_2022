Using a term coined by Kurz, Selma Yildrim (SP\u00d6) said that \u201cthis \u2018new normal\u2019, with its drastic intrusions into basic rights to freedom, cannot actually become normal\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, leader of liberal NEOS, Beate Meinl-Reisinger, had also said that \u201cthere is either normal or abnormal. There is no \u2018new normal\u2019\u201d. Herbert Kickl of the right-wing FP\u00d6 has vowed to fight the measures at the constitutional court.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Apr 16 08:37:30 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/themes/euractiv_com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "wp-parsely_version": "2.0", "robots": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot-news": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "VIENNA - Opposition parties criticise government for corona-crisis measures"}, "og": {"title": "VIENNA - Opposition parties criticise government for corona-crisis measures", "url": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/vienna-opposition-parties-criticise-government-for-corona-crisis-measures/", "type": "article", "site_name": "www.euractiv.com", "image": {"alt": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/vienna-opposition-parties-criticise-government-for-corona-crisis-measures/"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-04-16 08:37:30", "author": "Philipp Gr\u00fcll"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/ea_favicon_16x16.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/vienna-opposition-parties-criticise-government-for-corona-crisis-measures/"}
