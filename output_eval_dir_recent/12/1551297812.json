According to the researchers, biases in sensory perception can arise from both experimental manipulations and personal trait-like features.\n\nEveryone has bias, and neuroscientists can see what happens inside your brain as you succumb to it. The clue comes from alpha brain waves \u2014 a pattern of activity when the neurons in the front of your brain fire in rhythm together, they said.\n\nAlpha brain waves pop up when people make decisions, but it remains unclear what their role is. For the findings, the researchers Laetitia Grabot and Christoph Kayser from the Bielefeld University in Germany, used electroencephalography to monitor the brain activity of adults while they made a decision.\n\nAccording to the study, the participants saw a picture and heard a sound milliseconds apart and then decided which one came first.\n\nPrior to the experiment, the researchers determined if the participants possessed a bias for choosing the picture or sound. Before the first stimulus appeared, the strength of the alpha waves revealed how the participants would decide, the researchers said.\n\nThe study revealed that weaker alpha waves meant resisting the bias; stronger alpha waves indicated succumbing to the bias. \u201cThese results also hold after temporal recalibration and are specific to the alpha band, suggesting that alpha band activity reflects, directly or indirectly, processes that help to overcome an individual\u2019s momentary bias in perception,\u201d the researchers wrote.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Bielefeld University", "alpha brain waves", "Laetitia Grabot", "Christoph Kayser", "electroencephalography"], "tags": ["alpha brain waves", "electroencephalography", "Laetitia Grabot", "Bielefeld University", "Christoph Kayser"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "According to the researchers, biases in sensory perception can arise from both experimental manipulations and personal trait-like features.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "Bielefeld University,alpha brain waves,Laetitia Grabot,Christoph Kayser,electroencephalography", "description": "According to the researchers, biases in sensory perception can arise from both experimental manipulations and personal trait-like features.", "title": "Scientists can reveal bias in your brain", "keywords": "Bielefeld University,alpha brain waves,Laetitia Grabot,Christoph Kayser,electroencephalography", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/health/scientists-can-reveal-bias-in-your-brain", "title": "Scientists can reveal bias in your brain", "image": {"identifier": "https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2Fimport%2F2015%2F07%2Fetc-lead14.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C400%2C210&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "site_name": "Free Press Journal"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Scientists can reveal bias in your brain", "image": "https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2Fimport%2F2015%2F07%2Fetc-lead14.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C400%2C225&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true", "creator": "IANS", "site": "Free Press Journal", "domain": "https://www.freepressjournal.in"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2254637581419855, "pages": 178566438825717}, "viewport": "width=device-width,height=device-height,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=2.0,minimum-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/health/scientists-can-reveal-bias-in-your-brain"}
