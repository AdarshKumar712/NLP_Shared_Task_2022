liquidators for Caroline Bay\n\nSitting idle: Unfinished homes at the Caroline Bay complex in Morgan\u2019s Point (Photograph by Blaire Simmons)\n\n\n\nA legal bid to put the assets of the stalled Caroline Bay resort project into the hands of provisional liquidators was launched today, the Government revealed tonight.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Ministry of Finance said: \u201cThe developers acknowledged in February 2018 that they were unable to pay their debts and while the Government has done everything prudently possible to support efforts to refinance the project, to date the developers have failed to provide an acceptable way forward.\u201d\n\nShe added that senior members of professional services firm EY Bermuda had been appointed as joint provisional liquidators and it was planned that they would \u201ctake control of various project companies, representing the collateral behind the original project loans and Bermuda Government guarantees\u201d.\n\nThe spokeswoman said: \u201cAs the Government has expressed previously, the intention is to protect the interests of the people of Bermuda to the fullest extent permissible under the law.\u201d\n\nCurtis Dickinson, the finance minister, will hold a press conference tomorrow to reveal more details.\n\nThe project, at the former US naval base at Morgan\u2019s Point in the West End, was backed with a $165 million Government guarantee arranged under the previous One Bermuda Alliance administration, which had to be paid to lenders last year after finance for the development collapsed.\n\nThe payout required Parliament to approve a $200 million line of credit for the Ministry of Finance and the island\u2019s debt ceiling was raised by $250 million as a result.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords":
