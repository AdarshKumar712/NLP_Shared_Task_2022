While no cases have been reported there yet, it is believed that the poor sanitary conditions and an environment in which it is difficult to practice the recommended social distancing guidelines make the camps particularly vulnerable.\n\nThe first cases of the virus were detected in a camp on the Greek mainland last week, as previously reported by Voice of Europe, which led the authorities to quarantine it. The Greek authorities have described the situation on their islands as a \u201cticking time bomb.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/V_of_Europe/status/1246018966235099136\n\nGermany\u2019s Ministry of the Interior announced that they would begin moving the migrants to Germany next week. The migrants will be held in quarantine for two weeks as a precaution before being distributed across various German states.\n\nThe Greek islands were already home to tens of thousands of migrants, as Greece is one of the main entry points into Europe for those coming from the Middle East who are hoping to reach the wealthier Western European countries, where government-provided resources for them are plentiful. The numbers have gone up even further since Turkey announced that they would no longer prevent migrants from crossing their territory at the end of February, which led to thousands of migrants storming the Turkish-Greek border in an attempt to break through the border fence \u2014 often assisted by the Turkish police.\n\nGreece has requested EU assistance to deal with the potential for outbreak in the migrant camps. Germany\u2019s offer is part of that.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/V_of_Europe/status/1243225950197821446", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["2020 Greek migrant crisis", "Coronavirus prevention measures", "migrant crisis", "Migrant Camps", "German Ministry of the Interior", "Coronavirus", "Germany", "COVID-19", "Greece", "migrants and disease"], "authors": ["Michael Lord"], "publish_date": "Wed Apr  8 20:13:10 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Germany has agreed to accept 50 migrants from camps on the Greek islands as a \"first step\" toward addressing the risk of a coronavirus outbreak there.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://voiceofeurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/voe_icon_32_32_VfL_icon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "3SbOHjGPcy0RWqDZSOvu3a_MoUulDPa6DLBzowp4hKE", "description": "Germany has agreed to accept 50 migrants from camps on the Greek islands as a \"first step\" toward addressing the risk of a coronavirus outbreak there.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Germany accepts migrants from Greece", "description": "Germany has agreed to accept 50 migrants from camps on the Greek islands as a \"first step\" toward addressing the risk of a coronavirus outbreak there.", "url": "https://voiceofeurope.com/2020/04/germany-accepts-migrants-from-greece/", "site_name": "Voice of Europe", "image": {"identifier": "https://voiceofeurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1189181443-e1586376756954.jpg", "secure_url": "https://voiceofeurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1189181443-e1586376756954.jpg", "width": 708, "height": 469}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/VofEurope/", "tag": "migrants and disease", "section": "European News", "published_time": "2020-04-08T20:13:10+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2046423412253371}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Germany has agreed to accept 50 migrants from camps on the Greek islands as a \"first step\" toward addressing the risk of a coronavirus outbreak there.", "title": "Germany accepts migrants from Greece", "site": "@v_of_europe", "image": "https://voiceofeurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1189181443-e1586376756954.jpg", "creator": "@v_of_europe"}}, "canonical_link": "https://voiceofeurope.com/2020/04/germany-accepts-migrants-from-greece/"}
