The competition level stepped up a great deal on Friday night during a road trip on Friday, Feb. 14, at Caledonia, where the Trojans came up short 100-49. The Trojans are 11-12 overall (4-10 TRC) with only two games left in the season.\n\nR-P vs. Cotter/Hope Lutheran\n\nThe first half would be the difference in the ballgame as the Trojans scored early and often. Sixty percent shooting in the game led to a 23-point (48-25) halftime lead. The second half was more competitive, but the outcome wasn\u2019t in doubt as R-P outscored the Ramblers 25-24 while on the way to the Three Rivers Conference victory.\n\nR-P made 29 of 48 (60%) shots in the game but were especially effective closer to the basket. They only missed six shots all night from two-point range, going 22 of 28 (78%) inside the arc. They were also successful outside the arc, making seven of 20 (35%) from long range. The only place they didn\u2019t shoot the lights out was at the free-throw line, where the hit eight of 14 tries.\n\nLuke O\u2019Hare led the team in scoring, one of four players in double figures with 17 points on eight of 11 shooting while grabbing five rebounds and dishing out four assists. Justin Ruberg added 13 points, eight rebounds, a team-high five steals, and four assists. Malachi Bunke added 12 points, with Ben Wieser adding 10 and four rebounds. Grady Hengel was the top facilitator on offense, leading the team with seven of its 20 assists while adding nine points.\n\nThe Trojans grabbed a total of 28 rebounds in the game, a low number that\u2019s not surprising when a team misses only four of every ten shots they take.\n\nDefensively, the team wound up with eight steals (Hengel 2) and Ruberg had both of the team\u2019s blocked shots.\n\nR-P vs. Caledonia\n\nPlaying in the gym of the No. 1-ranked team in Class AA basketball proved to be too much for the Trojans, who couldn\u2019t stop the powerful Warrior offense. Caledonia grabbed a 51-point win and boosted their overall record to 20-1.\n\nThe Caledonia roster is deep, with 12 Warriors contributing to their 100-point total. The Warriors led the game 62-34 at halftime. While the pace of scoring slowed down for both teams, Caledonia still held a 23-point edge (38-15) in the second half and cruised to on the way to a conference win and season sweep of the Trojans.\n\nRuberg was one of only two Trojans to break into double figures, leading the Trojans with 14 points. Logan Skalet added 11, which included three baskets from outside the three-point line. O\u2019Hare was one made basket from joining them in double figures, contributing eight points in the loss.\n\nNoah King led all scorers in the game with 28 points, which included six of the team\u2019s 10 three-pointers. Eli King added 15 points, and Jashon Simpson added 13 points.\n\nThe Warriors had an 18-point advantage in scoring from outside the three-point line, making 10 three-pointers (30 points) to Rushford-Peterson\u2019s four (12 points). The Warriors had a five-point edge at the free-throw line, making 12 of 18 tries to seven of eight for R-P.\n\nSchedule\n\nThe Trojans already kicked off the last week of the regular season with a road game at Lewiston-Altura on Tuesday, Feb. 18, looking to split the season series. They come home for the finale on Friday, Feb. 21, against Fillmore Central, with the Trojans looking to sweep the regular-season series against the Falcons.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Feb 19 10:49:25 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Rushford-Peterson boys\u2019 basketball team split a pair of conference games last week, starting with a convincing win over Winona Cotter/Hope Lutheran by a score of 73-49 on Tuesday, Feb. 11.
