Speaking with pal Winfrey, 66, King revealed that complete strangers came out of the woodwork to check up on her during the \u201cvery painful\u201d situation.\n\nIt was a special delivery from Katie Holmes, however, that stood out to the news anchor as incredibly thoughtful among all the vitriol.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been away, I came home, and on my kitchen counter was a box of cupcakes \u2014 I love cupcakes,\u201d King told Winfrey. \u201cThere was a box of cupcakes with a note, and it said: \u2018Katie and Suri were thinking about you.'\u201d\n\nImage zoom Gayle King and Katie Holmes Theo Wargo/Getty; Craig Barritt/WireImage\n\nImage zoom Gayle King and Katie Holmes, December 2017 Theo Wargo/Getty\n\n\u201cNow, I didn\u2019t even know Katie Holmes even knew where I lived, which means she had to find out, and that they came and they dropped it off. \u2026 I had to find somebody to get her email just so I could say, \u2018Thank you so much for doing that.'\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s the kindness of strangers that I will never forget during that time.\u201d\n\nA number of celebrities came to King\u2019s defense on social media in February, including Amy Schumer, who wrote on Instagram: \u201cI stand fiercely with @gayleking one of the most beloved journalists, mothers and friends of our time. However you feel about her interview, her receiving serious death threats is disgustingly unfair and unacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat surprised me is the people that came to reach out to me in unexpected places,\u201d said King, adding that people she had no connection to \u2014 like Ivanka Trump and Sean Spicer \u2014 reached out to her.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE\u2019s free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories\n\nResponding to the backlash, King told fans in February that she was \u201cmortified\u201d by the excerpt of the interview that was shown online, not capturing the breadth of the complete interview.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been up reading the comments about the interview I did with Lisa Leslie about Kobe Bryant. And I know that if I had only seen the clip that you saw, I\u2019d be extremely angry with me too. I am mortified, I am embarrassed and I am very angry,\u201d she said in an Instagram video at the time. \u201cUnbeknownst to me, my network put up a clip from a very wide-ranging interview, totally taken out of context, and when you see it that way, it\u2019s very jarring.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, a CBS News spokesperson said: \u201cGayle conducted a thoughtful, wide-ranging interview with Lisa Leslie about the legacy of Kobe Bryant. An excerpt was posted that did not reflect the nature and tone of the full interview.
