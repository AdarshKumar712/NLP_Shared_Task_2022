Community transmission, otherwise known as community spread, refers to when the source of an infection is unknown \u2013 i.e. experts are unable to be traced the infection back to someone who travelled to an affected area overseas, or someone who got the virus through contact with an individual who was infected.\n\nHealth Access Secretary Carla Vizzotti told reporters at a press conference that \"community transmission\" of Covid-19 is beginning, particularly in Buenos Aires City and its surroundings, as well as \"some cities in Chaco, Tierra del Fuego and C\u00f3rdoba.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez last week ordered a \"preventive and mandatory\" isolation, effective until the end of the month.\n\nBeyond the general measures, Vizzotti said, the potential application of additional measures in those regions are being analysed. Rumours have circulated in the last 24 hours that Fern\u00e1ndez will move to extend the quarantine period next week.\n\nVizzotti also stressed that there were concerns in the government about the number of individuals that are breaking the mandatory quarantine.\n\nThe issue was discussed on Sunday in a meeting led by Health Minister Gin\u00e9s Gonz\u00e1lez Garc\u00eda with representatives from all provinces.\n\n\"There is a lot of demand for enforcement and it is evident that people who have orders to isolate are not complying and that those who are arriving from trips do not visualise the importance of their isolation,\" she said.\n\n\"The whole system is preparing for the eventual situation of increased cases and increased demand. We are working to strengthen human resources and health centres. The Ministry is working hard on the centralised purchase of equipment,\" she added.\n\nSpeaking at the same press conference, Assistant Secretary for Health Strategy Alejandro Costa offered a review of the latest numbers.\n\n\"In Argentina, 266 cases have been confirmed, of which 190 have a history of international travel; 59 have local transmission in a cluster, one case has no history of travel or close contact, and 17 are undergoing epidemiological evaluation,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, Costa provided clarification regarding the cases of \"local cluster transmission,\" confirming that that is a reference to people who had contact with patients without being particularly close to them for an extended period \u2013 for example, health workers or those assigned to airports.\n\n\u2013 TIMES/PERFIL", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Mar 23 16:12:47 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Novel coronavirus is spreading via \"community transmission\" in CABA, its surroundings and \"some cities in Chaco, Tierra del Fuego and C\u00f3rdoba\" provinces, says Health Access Secretary Carla Vizzotti.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.batimes.com.ar/img/favicon/apple-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "description": "Novel coronavirus is spreading via \"community transmission\" in CABA, its surroundings and \"some cities in Chaco, Tierra del Fuego and C\u00f3rdoba\" provinces, says Health Access Secretary Carla Vizzotti.", "ads-load": 1, "ads-sec": "articulo", "ads-client": "212f2", "fb": {"pages": 346660759103097, "admins": "100000796672456,1483151046,1411317735", "app_id": 171058600109657}, "analytics-path-name": "/sitios/batimes", "analytics-client-id": "UA-4879118-1", "analytics-view": "news.show", "analytics-data": "{\"slug\":\"health-ministry-confirms-first-cases-of-community-transmission\",\"section\":\"sitios.batimes.nota\",\"author\":\"Geoffrey Comte\",\"date\":\"March, 23 2020 16:12:47 -0300\",\"id\":538170}", "comscore-client-id": 6906401, "google-site-verification": "Jg0lBfG_8wkinE66AODrFPC55pceDoLGemlA_Pim2Rw", "latam-analytics-client-id": "UA-155177894-1", "latam-analytics-path-name": "/ar/batimes", "latam-analytics-sample-rate": 100, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "last-render": "02-02-16 16:08:19", "og": {"url": "https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/argentina/health-ministry-confirms-first-cases-of-community-transmission.phtml", "type": "article", "locale": "en_EN", "site_name": "Buenos Aires Times", "title": "Health Ministry confirms first cases of \u2018community transmission\u2019 in Argentina", "description": "Novel coronavirus is spreading via \"community transmission\" in CABA, its surroundings and \"some cities in Chaco, Tierra del Fuego and C\u00f3rdoba\" provinces, says Health Access Secretary Carla Vizzotti.", "updated_time": "2020-03-23T16:33:08-03:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://fotos.perfil.com/2020/03/23/trim/1140/641/health-ministry-press-conf-930037.jpg", "secure_url": "https://fotos.perfil.com/2020/03/23/trim/1140/641/health-ministry-press-conf-930037.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1140, "height": 641, "alt": "The Secretary of Health Access, Carla Vizzotti, the Undersecretary of Health Strategies, Alejandro Costa, provided details of the epidemiological situation in Argentina on Sunday.
