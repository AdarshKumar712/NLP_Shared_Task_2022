(WWLP) \u2013 Ever notice your gym gets busier in January? Getting active is one of the top New Year\u2019s resolutions that people make.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to watch how many stick with it and are here in February and March. It\u2019s fun to watch them come and go and try and encourage people to do it,\u201d a gym member and Wilbraham resident, Sue Rigney said.\n\nThat\u2019s because fitness, in many surveys we saw, was the number one resolution for people in the new year.\n\nUnfortunately, many people end up abandoning the resolution only a few weeks in. According to U.S. News and World Report, the failure rate for resolutions is 80 percent.\n\n\u201cSome people set unrealistic expectations unfortunately sometimes. So it\u2019s good to have a good set one,\u201d Best Fitness front desk employee, Tyler Cote told 22News.\n\nGoogle Trends shows that searches related to exercise peak around January 1st every year. That\u2019s when gyms also typically see a spike in membership sign-ups.\n\nThe International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association says 12 percent of new gym memberships happen in January, the most out of any other month.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re going to start seeing a lot of new people coming in because you know everyone has their fitness resolutions and once the new year comes everyone\u2019s like let\u2019s get on it. It\u2019s the best time, new year new me,\u201d Cote continued.\n\nGym staff recommends starting a small goal that you can track for your New Year\u2019s fitness journey to avoid taking on too much, too fast.\n\n\u201cThe first step is to come in the door,\u201d Cote said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["More State Police Overtime Investigation", "Your Local Election Headquarters"], "authors": ["Katrina Kincade", "Ariana Tourangeau", "Nancy Asiamah", "Kristina D'Amours"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 20:03:46 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Getting active is one of the top New Year's resolutions.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.wwlp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2019/05/cropped-22News-Favicon-1.jpg?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Getting active is one of the top New Year's resolutions.", "google-site-verification": "McT98raStSHKcKLXAnIZjZPdRiUNhtGenV0g2WGzemw", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "fb": {"pages": 16780999098}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Local gyms see spike in memberships due to fitness resolutions", "url": "https://www.wwlp.com/news/local-news/hampden-county/local-gyms-see-spike-in-memberships-due-to-fitness-resolutions/", "description": "Getting active is one of the top New Year\u2019s resolutions.", "site_name": "WWLP", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.wwlp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2020/01/new-years-fitness-tile.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "secure_url": "https://www.wwlp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2020/01/new-years-fitness-tile.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T20:03:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T22:22:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Local gyms see spike in memberships due to fitness resolutions"}, "image": "https://www.wwlp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2020/01/new-years-fitness-tile.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Local gyms see spike in memberships due to fitness resolutions", "description": "Getting active is one of the top New Year\u2019s resolutions."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.wwlp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2019/05/cropped-22News-Favicon-1.jpg?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.wwlp.com/news/local-news/hampden-county/local-gyms-see-spike-in-memberships-due-to-fitness-resolutions/"}
