In a section of North Austin that has become a hub for breweries, Hopsquad opened for the first time this weekend with four beers on draft in an airy, dog-friendly taproom.</p><p>Cousins Alex and Cesar Limon transformed a warehouse, the former site of an office furniture supply company, into Hopsquad &#8212; just about next door to Circle Brewing and a quick drive to other area breweries such as 4th Tap Brewing Co-op, Oskar Blues and Celis Brewery. The new beer maker is easily visible from Braker Lane thanks to a facade completely covered in art by David Rocha.</p><p><em><strong id=\"strong-3f6de187112dc86bc6379667063a2d45\">&gt;&gt; RELATED:</strong></em> <a href=\"https://www.austin360.com/entertainment/20191115/central-machine-works-opens-as-massive-brewery-beer-garden-in-east-austin\">Central Machine Works opens as massive brewery, beer garden in East Austin</a></p><p>Hopsquad aims to stand out in a crowded local market by turning its brews into memorable characters such as the Lord Zanate IPA and Dutchess of Oltorf Holiday Roggenbier, both of which are on the opening beer list. All four current options are $5. Other beverages available include a cider from the neighboring Fairweather Cider and one red, white, ros&eacute; and sparkling wine each.</p><p>A food truck, Tsuke Honten, is permanently on-site as the Asian fusion vision of chef Michael Che, who previously worked at two stellar sushi spots in Austin, Soto and Kyoten Sushiko, according to his bio on <a href=\"https://www.tsukehonten.com/\">the food truck's website</a>.</p><p>Check out Hopsquad at 2307 Kramer Ln. during the current taproom hours: 3 to 9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 12 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 12 to 6 p.m. Sunday. (Hopsquad is open this Tuesday only, 6 p.m. to midnight, for New Year's Eve celebrations.) The open hours may change as the North Austin brewery finds its footing.</p><p>For more information, visit <a href=\"http://hopsquad.com/\">hopsquad.com</a>.</p>"

					<p><p>In August 2018, a tweet from Hopsquad Brewing hinted at the struggles the long-in-planning brewery was enduring to get up and running: &#8220;We&#8217;ve had more delays than we can count so we stopped promising (opening) dates.&#8221;</p><br><p>But Hopsquad hasn&#8217;t let another year go by without opening its doors. In a section of North Austin that has become a hub for breweries, Hopsquad opened for the first time this weekend with four beers on draft in an airy, dog-friendly taproom.</p><br><p>Cousins Alex and Cesar Limon transformed a warehouse, the former site of an office furniture supply company, into Hopsquad &#8212; just about next door to Circle Brewing and a quick drive to other area breweries such as 4th Tap Brewing Co-op, Oskar Blues and Celis Brewery. The new beer maker is easily visible from Braker Lane thanks to a facade completely covered in art by David Rocha.</p><br><p>&gt;&gt; RELATED: Central Machine Works opens as massive brewery, beer garden in East Austin</p><br><p>Hopsquad aims to stand out in a crowded local market by turning its brews into memorable characters such as the Lord Zanate IPA and Dutchess of Oltorf Holiday Roggenbier, both of which are on the opening beer list. All four current options are $5. Other beverages available include a cider from the neighboring Fairweather Cider and one red, white, rosé and sparkling wine each.</p><br><p>A food truck, Tsuke Honten, is permanently on-site as the Asian fusion vision of chef Michael Che, who previously worked at two stellar sushi spots in Austin, Soto and Kyoten Sushiko, according to his bio on the food truck&#8217;s website.</p><br><p>Check out Hopsquad at 2307 Kramer Ln. during the current taproom hours: 3 to 9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 12 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 12 to 6 p.m. Sunday. (Hopsquad is open this Tuesday only, 6 p.m. to midnight, for New Year&#8217;s Eve celebrations.) The open hours may change as the North Austin brewery finds its footing.</p><br><p>For more information, visit hopsquad.com.</p></p>
