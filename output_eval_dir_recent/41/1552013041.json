Since its inception in 2008 with The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man, the MCU has been on a steady incline as its popularity spreads across the globe and its box-offices continue to rise.\n\nTo this day, the MCU has amassed an unbelievable $22.5 billion at the box-office with the average per film being a remarkable $980.5 million. While there is a spectrum regarding the 'success' of each of the MCU films, there has yet to be a flop or a 'box-office bomb'. No MCU film has had a 'rotten' rating according to Rotten Tomatoes and even the least commercially successful film still brought in a respectable $260 million. (Worldwide box office presented in parentheses.)\n\n23 The Incredible Hulk ($263,427,551)\n\nvia ew.com\n\nWhile its MCU-integration is fairly questionable, 2008\u2019s The Incredible Hulk is technically considered one of the first MCU film. Starring the talented Edward Norton, the film was a decent showing of Bruce Banner\u2019s struggle with his other angrier and destructive half and helped to kick-off one of the most successful film studios of all-time.\n\n22 Captain America: The First Avenger ($370,569,774)\n\nVia: hollywoodreporter.com\n\nThe first Captain America film was a breath of fresh air, jumping back in time and being a period piece set during the second world war. This origin story of Cap consequently has a distinct tone compared to other MCU films, and was a strong foundational piece in the story of Cap and the burgeoning MCU.\n\n21 Thor ($449,326,618)\n\nvia youtube.com\n\nAnother more \u2018out-there\u2019 MCU entry, the first Thor film went for a more Shakespearean feel for its Norse mythological tale. While its mix of elements of godlike royalty and rural USA didn\u2019t always mesh well, the film still did well in establishing the Thunder God\u2019s core plight and cast of supporting characters.\n\n20 Ant-Man ($519,311,965)\n\nvia The Verge\n\nAnt-Man has never been the most popular Marvel hero, however the studio did wise in narrowing the scope of his first solo film, creating an insular heist-like MCU movie based around the ever-charismatic Paul Rudd as Scott Lang. Pairing him with Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, and Michael Pena helped to make Ant-Man a still-decent success.\n\n19 Ant-Man And The Wasp ($622,674,139)\n\nvia Time\n\nEven if it\u2019s not by a wide margin, it\u2019s always a good sign when a sequel does better and not worse than its predecessor. Ant-Man and the Wasp ever so slightly expanded on Scott Lang\u2019s world, now bringing Evangeline Lilly\u2019s Hope van Dyne (aka the Wasp) in as his superhero partner. Plus, with additions in Michelle Pfeiffer and Laurence Fishburne, this sequel suddenly had a lot going for it.\n\n18 Iron Man ($585,174,222)\n\nvia youtube.com\n\nThe film that truly kickstarted the MCU, 2008\u2019s Iron Man really was a pivotal moment in cinematic history. Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s perfect casting and portrayal of the charismatic yet deeply-flawed Tony Stark set a new precedent for superheroes and comic book movies alike. Many still see this film as the best of the MCU to-date.\n\nRelated: 20 Actors Who Would've Been Great In These MCU Roles\n\n17 Thor: The Dark World ($644,571,402)\n\nvia amazon.com\n\nThor\u2019s sequel film is generally regarded as one of the weaker MCU instalments. However, as is the case here, sequels still often do better than their predecessors thanks to a growing fanbase for the franchise/characters. The Dark World still had some good action and eventually would play an important early role in the lead up to the Infinity Stone saga.\n\n16 Doctor Strange ($677,718,395)\n\nvia twitter.com\n\nThe Sorcerer Supreme\u2019s film was one of the significant character debuts of MCU\u2019s Phase Three. Doctor Strange introduced the mystical side of Marvel that, in combination with the ever-great Benedict Cumberbatch, led to a strong debut for Doctor Strange. Fans have been waiting a long time now for the doctor\u2019s second outing.\n\n15 Iron Man 2 ($623,933,331)\n\nVia Collider.com\n\nIron Man has always been one of the largest MCU box-office draws. While his second film was not altogether the best, the film still ratcheted up the action and the stakes enough to surpass the revenue of the first film. Adding another Iron Man (War Machine) and some memorable villains was enough to make Iron Man 2 a resounding success.\n\n14 Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($714,264,267)\n\nvia youtube.com\n\nThe Winter Soldier was the MCU\u2019s attempt at a semi-political thriller \u2013 a somewhat risky move for a studio making superhero films. However, this film ended up receiving rave reviews and is generally regarded as one of the best films of the entire MCU. With a co-starring role for Black Widow, Fury, Falcon, and the new enigmatic & dangerous Winter Soldier, Cap\u2019s second film did remarkably well.\n\n13 Guardians Of The Galaxy ($773,328,629)\n\nvia: denofgeek.com\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy was the first major risk for Marvel. They banked an entire film on a pretty much unknown group of characters and set it in space where the film would have more-or-less no connections to the rest of the MCU. However, writer/director James Gunn ended up with a grand slam, instantly rocketing the Guardians family into stardom thanks to this action-packed, hilarious, and heartfelt film.\n\n12 Thor: Ragnarok ($853,977,126)\n\nVia TheVerge.com\n\nAfter the poorly received The Dark World, Thor: Ragnarok changed up the formula of the Thor franchise drastically. Bringing on the eccentric Taika Waititi, Ragnarok ended up being a zany sci-fi adventure for the God of Thunder and his angry buddy, the Hulk, as they became trapped on a distant gladiatorial planet. The film was a massive success both commercially and with the critics.\n\n11 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ($863,756,051)\n\nvia: marvel.com\n\nGuardians Vol. 2 didn\u2019t shake things up much from the first volume, but simply carried on the adventures of this spacefaring team. Luckily, the old mantra of \u201cdon\u2019t fix what ain\u2019t broken\u201d served the film well, and the Guardians' now-enormous fanbase flocked out for this bigger and better sequel.\n\nRelated: 15 Marvel Characters The MCU Completely Ruined\n\n10 Spider-Man: Homecoming ($880,166,924)\n\nvia Moviedash\n\nThere probably isn\u2019t a person alive who doesn\u2019t know the name \u2018Spider-Man\u2019. The old wallcrawler is arguably Marvel\u2019s most recognizable & profitable character and so it was bound to be big news (and big money) when Sony finally agreed to terms to allow Spidey to enter the MCU. With a high school based story, the great Michael Keaton as the Vulture, and relative newcomer Tom Holland as Peter Parker, the film was a massive success.\n\n9 Captain Marvel ($1,128,275,794)\n\nvia BGR\n\nIt took far too long for Marvel to come out with its first female-led superhero film. Luckily, it did eventually happen with the powerful Carol Danvers, aka Captain Marvel, at the helm. Played by Academy Award winner Brie Larson, the film was successful on every front and incredibly cracked the $1 billion box-office mark.\n\n8 Spider-Man: Far From Home ($1,131,927,996)\n\nvia vox.com\n\nMore Spider-Man = more money. The most recent MCU film has continued the studio\u2019s upward trend of increased box-office. Far From Home continued from where Homecoming left off with Peter\u2019s class going on a European school trip where Spidey finds himself face-to-face with Mysterio played by Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\n7 Captain America: Civil War ($1,153,304,495)\n\nVia: youtube.com\n\nCivil War was, in all respects, pretty much an Avengers film. Containing almost all of the core members (minus Thor and Hulk), this film had the massive fan draw of seeing our Marvel heroes finally go toe-to-toe with one another. If that wasn\u2019t enough, it also introduced the likes of both Spider-Man and Black Panther into the MCU. Now, really, who wouldn\u2019t pay to see that?\n\n6 Iron Man 3 ($1,214,811,252)\n\nVia PopSugar.com\n\nThe box-office increase from Iron Man 2 to 3 is quite remarkable with Iron Man\u2019s final solo film more-or-less doubling its predecessor. While the film had some criticisms for its red herring portrayal of infamous Iron Man villain, The Mandarin, it was still an exciting film and steps above the dismal Iron Man 2.\n\n5 Black Panther ($1,346,913,161)\n\nvia Vox\n\nLike Captain Marvel, Black Panther was a necessary addition to the MCU and one that helped to address issues of representation within the franchise. On top of that important facet, Black Panther was, in almost every way, a fantastic film and it currently holds the highest MCU rotten tomatoes rating of 97%. This is another film whose sequel is highly anticipated.\n\n4 Avengers: Age Of Ultron ($1,405,403,694)\n\nvia reddit.com\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s going to make big money at the box office, it\u2019s having a film with \u2018Avengers\u2019 in its name. The first Avengers sequel maintained the momentum of the original with the same core team and writer/director, Joss Whedon, albeit with a few new additions in Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Vision, and the villainous Ultron. While it wasn\u2019t nearly as popular with the critics, it still definitely made the big bucks.\n\n3 The Avengers ($1,518,812,988)\n\nvia medium.com\n\nThe original MCU team-up and a pivotal moment in film history. The film that was the culmination of multiple years of set up, bringing together characters from various franchises in a way that likely hadn\u2019t been seen since the 1930\u2019s Universal monster films. The Avengers was a momentous success and cemented the MCU as the film-powerhouse that it is today.\n\n2 Avengers: Infinity War ($2,048,359,754)\n\nvia vox.com\n\nInfinity War was the first half of the gigantic climax of the first three Phases of the MCU. It was like the original Avengers on steroids with its culmination of a decade\u2019s worth of films, pulling together characters from every MCU film while also introducing new ones like Thanos and his Black Order. This was the beginning of a film event like never before seen.\n\n1 Avengers: Endgame ($2,797,800,564)\n\nVia rollingstone.com\n\nThe big kahuna! Endgame \u2013 the film that broke every film record in existence. Not only was Endgame the final chapter in MCU\u2019s first \u2018lifespan\u2019 but it was also a rollercoaster of a film with major twists, action, and ramifications for the numerous MCU heroes within. The film also provided a tangible gut punch for fans as they had to say goodbye to some of the now-most famous and beloved film heroes of all-time. Endgame truly had it all!\n\nNext: Ranking Our 20 Favorite MCU Characters By Who We'd Want To Be\n\nShare Tweet Email Share\n\nNext 15 Things We Know About John Wick 4 So Far", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Mar 18 16:10:35 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "No MCU film has had a 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes and even the least commercially successful film still brought in a respectable $260 million.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/public/build/images/favicon-32x32.1f92dab2.png", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "description": "No MCU film has had a 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes and even the least commercially successful film still brought in a respectable $260 million.", "og": {"title": "Here Are All The MCU Films, Ranked From Flop To Money-Maker", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://static1.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/avn-fi.jpg", "width": 1710, "height": 900}, "url": "https://www.thethings.com/mcu-films-ranked-flop-to-money-maker/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "No MCU film has had a 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes and even the least commercially successful film still brought in a respectable $260 million.", "site_name": "TheThings"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-18T16:10:35Z", "section": "Movies"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1704776379798523, "pages": 816297408482105}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thethings.com/mcu-films-ranked-flop-to-money-maker/"}
