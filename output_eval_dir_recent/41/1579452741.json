The highly contagious disease overwhelmed national healthcare systems, leading to the shutdowns of entire economies.\n\nIn the early months of the pandemic, the primary challenge faced by all nations, including the United States, was testing. No plan to combat the disease could be formulated until healthcare authorities had a good idea of how many people were infected.\n\nBecause one of the very first symptoms of COVID-19 is a fever, many nations made extensive use of temperature screening checkpoints. These were set up at airports, outside apartment buildings, and even at stores. But these methods were imperfect. Authorities used industrial-grade infrared thermometers to measure the temperature of people, leading in inaccurate readings. Many researchers also doubted the effectiveness of airport screening.\n\nAs an acclaimed futurist and healthcare presenter, I have proposed a solution: the constituent healthcare operating system (CHOS). As I reveal in my upcoming book The Healthcare Mandate, the core of the system is a personal, ear-worn digital biomonitor, which provides a detailed, real-time picture of an individual\u2019s current health. Aside from taking four primary vital signs\u2014body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate\u2014it also connects to other body sensors, providing streaming predictive data to a central module. The module is accessible to the individual\u2019s primary care physician and relevant specialists.\n\nStreaming the individual\u2019s data in real-time to their healthcare provider serves two purposes:\n\n1. The primary care physician no longer needs to rely on the individual to self-report symptoms of an emerging disease. The physician sees them in real-time.\n\n2. In terms of identifying infectious diseases such as COVID-19, the individual\u2019s CHOS can provide the earliest possible warning of a fever, a change in breathing pattern, or a cough.\n\nFor example, in March 2020 it would have been incredibly valuable for US healthcare authorities to know in real-time who among our nation\u2019s 327 million people were showing those three symptoms. Science fiction? No. The technology is within reach.\n\nImagine millions of individuals, all plugged into a comprehensive digital healthcare system. When another virulent disease like COVID-19 breaks out\u2014which we know it eventually will\u2014then we will have no need for inaccurate, clumsy, and time-consuming airport or roadside tests. The data will come streaming in from millions of constituents. Massive disruption to our economy by shutting down public businesses including theaters, schools, and sporting events may not be necessary because we\u2019ll know exactly who has the disease.\n\nThe CHOS system is a simple, elegant solution to the problem of managing the outbreak of infectious diseases. The technology is within reach. All that is needed is the Nation's will to make it a reality.\n\nNicholas Webb is one of the top innovation and healthcare futurist speakers in the world and a number one best-selling author.
