Where? When? \u2014 remain unanswered. Testing, part of the new normal of this coronavirus era, will be a major component to any return-to-play plan that the NBA comes up with. The Disney campus near Orlando, Florida makes so much sense, given its massive size, multiple courts and its ties to league broadcast partner ESPN. And the sooner games begin, the sooner the process of figuring out next season can start as well.\n\n\n\nSeveral people familiar with the details of the conversations have told The Associated Press this week that players around the league are being urged to start getting mentally and physically ready for training camps that could be just a few weeks away. It might not be a unanimously approved notion, but 2-1/2 months into this pandemic-caused shutdown, the NBA finally seems on the cusp of being able to move forward.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have faith in Adam Silver and the NBA, and the NBA teams ... they\u2019re not going to have us come back if it\u2019s even a question of us getting hurt,\u201d Jared Dudley of the Los Angeles Lakers, a former member of the Bucks, said this week. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where the testing, being clean, and doing everything that I feel that they\u2019ll do to keep us safe.\u201d\n\n\n\nPick a scenario for the return-to-play plan, and someone has surely heard it already. Bringing back all 30 teams and resuming the regular season is an option. So is bringing back something like 20 teams and having an expanded playoff of sorts, a notion that essentially mirrors what the NHL is talking about these days. A condensed playoff has also been discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarc Lasry\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest sign of momentum: Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry, speaking Thursday on CNBC, said the NBA's board of governors will meet again next week and that he believes \u201cwithin the next six to eight weeks we should be playing.\"\n\n\n\nSilver, the commissioner who has had to deal with a series of turbulent matters from the strained China relationship in the preseason, to the deaths of David Stern and Kobe Bryant in January, and now a pandemic that will almost certainly affect the league\u2019s financial health for the next several years \u2014 is listening to any and all ideas.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe direction that the league office has received from our teams is, again, all rules are off at this point given the situation we find ourselves in, that the country is in,\u201d Silver said last month. \u201cIf there is an opportunity to resume play, even if it looks different than what we\u2019ve done historically, we should be modeling it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver (Photo by Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe calendar dictates that those decisions are going to come soon, backed up by the fact that Silver told players two weeks ago that he wants to be able to bring forward a return-to-play plan in \u201ctwo to four weeks.\u201d By that timeframe, the window is about to open.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about the possibility of coming back,\u201d Cleveland forward Kevin Love said in remarks broadcast on the NBA\u2019s Twitter channel this week. \u201cI think there\u2019s so much good that can come from it. ... People need that escape and as athletes too, we want to get back to what we love most.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s going to be different. Fans won\u2019t be at games, barring some seismic shift in thinking. Home-court advantage won\u2019t exist since games will almost certainly all be at neutral sites. Even the Orlando Magic won\u2019t have the home-court edge; they might be able to use their own homes if the NBA comes to Central Florida, but it\u2019s not like the games will be in their arena.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo and LeBron James (Photo by Harry How/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd someone is probably going to test positive when play resumes. If that happens, he\u2019ll almost certainly have to sit out a minimum of two weeks. If a playoff series is held on an every-other-day basis, that means once someone is positive there\u2019s no way he can return to that series. Imagine if LeBron James or Giannis Antetokounmpo tests positive; the title chances for the Lakers and Milwaukee Bucks would basically be gone in an instant.\n\n\n\nBut in a season where the NBA is certainly going to lose money, quite possibly $1 billion or more, there is an obvious appetite for getting back to work if safety can be assured.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis has been like being an anxious kid that wants to do something but can\u2019t, or an anxious dog where you tell him to sit and he looks at you like \u2018C\u2019mon bro\u2019 and his tail starts wagging because he\u2019s so excited,\u201d All-Star Bam Adebayo of the Miami Heat said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a whole spectrum of the unknown.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["COVID-19 and the Economy", "Entertainment", "Small Business", "View More", "FOX6 Investigators", "Packers", "In The Garden", "Politics", "President Joe Biden", "Contact 6", "V.P.
