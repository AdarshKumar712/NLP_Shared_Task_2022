It\u2019s what happened to a certain Giuseppi Conte, a singular character, stranger to politics, who strong to have been recklessly entrusted President of the council, first by the 5 Stelle and Lega and to follow with PD, he is convinced he is God On earth and therefore allowed to be a professor by throwing his poisonous strangers at a vast audience of naive from the powerful media and thus passing the seat of the democratic debate that is Parliament!\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that Giuseppi has taken advantage of this system in beard to the parliamentarians elected by the people to whom it should relate! For this outrage he should be relieved of his charge by the President of the Republic Sergio Mattarella who has so far closed his eyes in front of his millanteries. At Conte there are only damage and many announcements.\n\nThe Italians are still waiting for the money he and his snack mates promised would arrive in their pockets before Easter and the evidence is under everyone\u2019s eyes! So, while many people starve and fall into the darkest despair, the Count fills his belly with our money.
