It also noted that at the same time, it \u201cpreserves and ensures the specificity of Vatican law, which recognises in the canonical system the first source of legislation and the first criterion of interpretation.\u201d\n\nMoreover, it listed the following five points as being among its most important features, which are especially important in \u201cadapting to the current historical and institutional context that requires ever greater efficiency\u201d:\n\n1. provides for a better guarantee of the independence of judicial bodies and magistrates who depend only on the Supreme Pontiff who appoints them and are subject to the law, exercising their functions with impartiality and with direct recourse to the judicial police;\n\n2. requires specific requirements for the appointment of magistrates who are chosen among university professors and in any case among jurists of evident reputation, with proven experience, judicial or forensic, in civil, criminal or administrative matters;\n\n3. provides for a simplification of the judicial system and, at the same time, a reinforcement of the staff of the Tribunal, which is increased by one unit, also providing for a full-time and exclusive regime for at least one of the judges;\n\n4. presents an autonomous head for the Office of the Promoter of Justice, distinct from that of the Tribunal;\n\n5. provides for a typification, hitherto lacking, of possible disciplinary measures regarding registered lawyers.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["middle east", "abortion", "marriage", "Interviews"], "authors": ["Deborah Castellano Lubov", "About Deborah Castellano Lubov", "Deborah Castellano Lubov Is Senior Vatican", "Rome Correspondent For Zenit", "Author Of 'The Other Francis'", "'L'Altro Francesco'", "Featuring Interviews With Those Closest To The Pope", "Preface Vatican Secretary Of State Cardinal Parolin", "Currently Published In Languages", "Deborah Is Also Nbc"], "publish_date": "Mon Mar 16 12:41:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Vatican Publishes Law No. CCCLI on Vatican City State Judicial System - ZENIT - English", "description": "Comes in Wake of Regulatory Reforms in Economic-Financial & Criminal Matters", "url": "https://zenit.org/articles/vatican-publishes-law-no-cccli-on-vatican-city-state-judicial-system/", "site_name": "ZENIT - English", "updated_time": "2020-03-16T12:59:27+01:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://zenit.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/WhatsApp-Image-2020-03-10-at-1.58.40-PM-1.jpeg", "secure_url": "https://zenit.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/WhatsApp-Image-2020-03-10-at-1.58.40-PM-1.jpeg", "width": 1600, "height": 1200}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/zenitnewsagency", "author": "NULL", "tag": "Feature3", "section": "Vatican Dicasteries/Diplomacy", "published_time": "2020-03-16T12:41:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-16T12:59:27+01:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Comes in Wake of Regulatory Reforms in Economic-Financial & Criminal Matters", "title": "Vatican Publishes Law No. CCCLI on Vatican City State Judicial System - ZENIT - English", "site": "@zenitenglish", "image": "https://zenit.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/WhatsApp-Image-2020-03-10-at-1.58.40-PM-1.jpeg", "creator": "@NULL"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://zenit.org/articles/vatican-publishes-law-no-cccli-on-vatican-city-state-judicial-system/"}
