On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: \"Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.\"\n\nDespite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.\n\nEx UFO-chief claims he quit US government over alien encounter 'cover-up'\n\nTOP STORIES IN SCIENCE Investigation GAME SHAME YouTube flooded with hardcore sex videos from Roblox, a video game for KIDS TRACK DAY You can now race pals in Mario Kart on iPhone and Android for first time ever MURDER ON THE NILE Famous 'mistress' mummy Takabuti was KNIFED to death in her twenties LOGGED OFF WhatsApp to stop working on millions of phones this week \u2013 is yours on the list?
