Later this month there will be a service dedicated to all nine lives lost in the tragic helicopter accident from two weeks ago.\n\nSeveral tributes have been shared already to honor Bryant\u2019s life. Nonetheless, there are plenty of people in Los Angeles that want to know when there will be a memorial service for the public.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times provided an update on when and where Bryant\u2019s public memorial will take place.\n\nFrom the Los Angeles Times:\n\nLos Angeles will host a public memorial Feb. 24 at Staples Center for Kobe Bryant and eight others killed last month in a helicopter crash, two sources familiar with the event told The Times on Thursday.\n\nIt\u2019s fitting that it\u2019ll take place at the Staples Center. There have been plenty of fans over the past two weeks showing their support of Bryant in plenty of ways, such as leaving behind letters and memorabilia for the fallen NBA legend.\n\nThe turnout for this public memorial should be large, especially since Bryant is such a beloved figure in Los Angeles.\n\nOur thoughts remain with those affected by the tragic accident that took place on Jan. 26 in Calabasas.\n\n[Los Angeles Times]", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Chris Rosvoglou"], "publish_date": "Thu Feb  6 21:17:04 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Los Angeles will host a public memorial later this month for Kobe Bryant and all the victims from the tragic helicopter crash.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Los Angeles will host a public memorial later this month for Kobe Bryant and all the victims from the tragic helicopter crash.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Plans Are Set For The Kobe Bryant Public Memorial Service", "description": "Los Angeles will host a public memorial later this month for Kobe Bryant and all the victims from the tragic helicopter crash.", "url": "https://thespun.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/plans-are-set-for-kobe-bryant-public-memorial", "site_name": "The Spun", "image": {"identifier": "https://thespun.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1196609182-1024x553.jpg", "secure_url": "https://thespun.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1196609182-1024x553.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 553}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thespundotcom/", "section": "Los Angeles Lakers", "published_time": "2020-02-06T21:17:04+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 647746892042636, "pages": 210769099450478}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Los Angeles will host a public memorial later this month for Kobe Bryant and all the victims from the tragic helicopter crash.", "title": "Plans Are Set For The Kobe Bryant Public Memorial Service", "site": "@TheSpun", "image": "https://thespun.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1196609182.jpg", "creator": "@RosvoglouReport"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.5", "ahrefs-site-verification": "a3595eb3f231cff8ae03a2fa3d0a0ced397ff2fd7cf431481c6b73bf444d7c16", "application-name": "The Spun", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://thespun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SPUNsquarePhosphateSolid-300x300.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "mstile-310x310.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://thespun.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/plans-are-set-for-kobe-bryant-public-memorial"}
