She is a woman from The Philippines, aged 33.\n\nThe other case is of a 30-year-old Maltese woman.\n\nThis brings the total number of cases to 484, with five deaths. The number of recovered persons in total is 407, leaving 72 active cases.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOf the four who recovered in the last day, one is aged between 10 and 19, two in their 20s and one in the 40s.\n\nGauci said that 21 of the 50 migrants who tested positive at the Hal Far centre have recovered, including spending seven days free of the virus, and have been moved to another section of the centre.\n\nAnother 19 have recovered but are spending the mandatory seven extra days before being moved to the general section of the centre.\n\nGauci said that there are no longer any cases being treated at the Intensive Care Unit at Mater Dei Hospital. \u201cThe two recent cases that were at ITU, are now back in the ward, as they no longer need intensive care treatment,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked about a request by three premier league clubs for the football season to resume on 1 July, with training to pick up on 10 June, Gauci said that it is too early to indicate what will happen in July, and warned people to be cautious of their actions and continue following social distancing. \u201cWe have eased certain measures all based on evidence, and now in the upcoming weeks we will see whether the numbers remain stable, and then we will be able to speak about additional measures.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether elderly people or pregnant woman can go out to shop or work in retail outlets, Gauci once again appealed for vulnerable people to protect themselves and to only go out when necessary.\n\nShe said that Malta is in discussions with the European Union and other countries to see how to implement and build a contact-tracing app.\n\nShe said that the health authorities have received a number of questions regarding face-masks and she explained that it is extremely important those people do not wet the mask. \u201cIf the mask is wet, it is important to change it immediately, as the moisture will attract bacteria.\u201d\n\nShe ended the daily press conference with an appeal to the public to avoid gathering on Mother\u2019s Day, this Sunday. \u201cThe best gift we can give mothers, especially those who are vulnerable, is to make sure they are safe and to not put our mothers at any risk this Mother\u2019s Day.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Giulia Magri"], "publish_date": "Wed May  6 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "~/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=3", "Description": "Health Superintendent Charmaine Gauci is giving her daily briefing on Coronavirus cases.", "Robots": "index,follow", "og": {"title": "Watch: Coronavirus briefing - two new cases, four recover; 72 active cases from total of 484 - The Malta Independent", "image": "https://www.independent.com.mt/file.aspx?f=205201", "description": "Health Superintendent Charmaine Gauci is giving her daily briefing on Coronavirus cases.", "url": "https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2020-05-06/local-news/Live-Coronavirus-briefing-6736222818"}, "fb": {"app_id": 709947179091415, "pages": 480288348662981}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IndependentMlt", "title": "Watch: Coronavirus briefing - two new cases, four recover; 72 active cases from total of 484 - The Malta Independent", "description": "Health Superintendent Charmaine Gauci is giving her daily briefing on Coronavirus cases.", "image": "https://www.independent.com.mt/file.aspx?f=205201"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2020-05-06/local-news/Live-Coronavirus-briefing-6736222818"}
