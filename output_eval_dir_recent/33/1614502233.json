You can still apply for a Super Hunt.\n\nHunters who applied for moose, sheep and goat can not apply for most deer, elk and pronghorn controlled hunts, but they can apply for Super Hunt tags, which include deer, elk, pronghorn and moose.\n\nAnyone who draws a Super Hunt tag can hunt in any open hunt area for the species drawn, including general and controlled hunts.\n\nEntries are $6 each for a single species and $20 for a Super Hunt combo that includes one tag for each species.\n\nDeadline for entries for the first Super Hunt drawing is May 31.\n\nEight elk, eight deer, eight pronghorn and one moose will be drawn.\n\nOne Super Hunt Combo will also be drawn. This winner is entitled to hunt all four species.\n\nWinners will be notified by June 10.\n\nA second drawing is available in August.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["outdoors", "mushrooms", "foraging", "forests", "berries", "fruits"], "tags": ["webpage"], "authors": ["Roger Phillips Idaho Department Of Fish"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Hunters who applied for controlled hunts for moose, bighorn sheep and mountain goat hunts can see if they drew a tag by going to the controlled hunt results webpage.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://magicvalley.com/content/tncms/site/icon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "outdoors, mushrooms, foraging, forests, berries, fruits", "news_keywords": "outdoors, mushrooms, foraging, forests, berries, fruits", "description": "Hunters who applied for controlled hunts for moose, bighorn sheep and mountain goat hunts can see if they drew a tag by going to the controlled hunt results webpage.", "author": "ROGER PHILLIPS Idaho Department of Fish and Game", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=375099832", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.magicvalley.news", "googlebot": "noarchive", "google-site-verification": "m1RFSu3HgkLm7UOImoVL_lGb_BBeAaZwOYKq8jsVoTc", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://magicvalley.com/outdoors/controlled-hunt-drawing-results-for-moose-bighorn-sheep-and-mountain-goat-now-available/article_d961da7e-7309-5a27-bdb2-39fea2df90aa.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/magicvalley.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/ba/4ba5332e-2c6c-56c0-bcf7-3299dbe74ba5/5e0bdaadc9ed0.image.png?crop=210%2C118%2C0%2C60&resize=356%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize", "width": 356, "height": 200}, "title": "Controlled hunt drawing results for moose, bighorn sheep and mountain goat now available", "description": "Hunters who applied for controlled hunts for moose, bighorn sheep and mountain goat hunts can see if they drew a tag by going to the controlled hunt results webpage.", "site_name": "Twin Falls Times-News", "section": "Outdoors"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thetimesnews/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@twinfallstn", "image": {"alt": "IDFG logo"}}, "fb": {"pages": 293729833266}, "parsely-title": "Controlled hunt drawing results for moose, bighorn sheep and mountain goat now available", "parsely-link": "https://magicvalley.com/outdoors/controlled-hunt-drawing-results-for-moose-bighorn-sheep-and-mountain-goat-now-available/article_d961da7e-7309-5a27-bdb2-39fea2df90aa.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-05-21T11:00:00-0600", "parsely-post-id": "d961da7e-7309-5a27-bdb2-39fea2df90aa", "parsely-image-url": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/magicvalley.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/ba/4ba5332e-2c6c-56c0-bcf7-3299dbe74ba5/5e0bdaadc9ed0.image.png?crop=210%2C118%2C0%2C60&resize=356%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize", "parsely-author": "ROGER PHILLIPS Idaho Department of Fish and Game", "parsely-section": "Outdoors", "parsely-tags": "outdoors, mushrooms, foraging, forests, berries, fruits"}, "canonical_link": "https://magicvalley.com/outdoors/controlled-hunt-drawing-results-for-moose-bighorn-sheep-and-mountain-goat-now-available/article_d961da7e-7309-5a27-bdb2-39fea2df90aa.html"}
