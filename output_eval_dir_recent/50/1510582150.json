Later, Batham had also hurled a crude bomb and fired gunshots on villagers and policemen rushed to rescue the children.\n\nSome reports said Batham held the children hostages, who were aged between six months and 15 years, for being wrongly framed in a murder case and wanted to pressurise the authorities for dropping the criminal charges against him.\n\nA local police officer told media that security personnel took the action with extreme caution in order to ensure the safety of the children locked inside the house.\n\nAfter the overnight stand-off, a special team of trained policemen and commandos killed him in a shoot-out, while two officers were also wounded in the operation.\n\nThe hostages were rescued by the security team without any injury.\n\nAccording to the reports, Batham\u2019s wife was also killed on Thursday night, after villagers reportedly beat her to death and threw stones at her when she attempted to run away from the scene.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["children hostage", "india", "subhash batham", "uttar pradesh"], "tags": ["INDIA PROTESTS", "NAB", "CORONAVIRUS", "Kashmir"], "authors": ["Web Desk"], "publish_date": "Fri Jan 31 10:45:58 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A man with criminal background, Subhash Batham, held at least 22 children hostage at his daughter's birthday party who was later killed in a police action.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://arynews.tv/favicon/favicon-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 485559268138376, "app_id": 959069414137414, "admins": "504655108,100007218967411"}, "description": "A man with criminal background, Subhash Batham, held at least 22 children hostage at his daughter's birthday party who was later killed in a police action.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Man takes 22 children hostage at daughter's birthday party", "description": "A man with criminal background, Subhash Batham, held at least 22 children hostage at his daughter's birthday party who was later killed in a police action.", "url": "https://arynews.tv/en/22-children-hostage-daughter-birthday-party/", "site_name": "ARY NEWS", "image": {"identifier": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/man-takes-children-hostage-2.jpg", "secure_url": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/man-takes-children-hostage-2.jpg", "width": 750, "height": 369}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/arynewsasia", "tag": "Subhash Batham", "section": "International", "published_time": "2020-01-31T10:45:58+05:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A man with criminal background, Subhash Batham, held at least 22 children hostage at his daughter's birthday party who was later killed in a police action.", "title": "Man takes 22 children hostage at daughter's birthday party", "site": "@arynewsofficial", "image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/man-takes-children-hostage-2.jpg", "creator": "@arynewsofficial"}, "keywords": "children hostage, india, subhash batham, uttar pradesh", "specificfeeds-verification-code-YVhnSHNwWExZUUZXWWlKZTl2MkZYMnp4Um1UbVZVdE8yV3NkNzV6Q3ZpTm1JcUw0VlBscjdadE9rdkJRVzFtK3E2NkRvRFlyTm4rTmdtZ3VOZ2MxUXh6bVo3Ly9wY2JZbE1rcURRd21Ld3NwUVl3R3VvTTkwNURhbnNETEpaZzJ8WXNqNE9TMHR2SFZYRzEyQm84QmU0cWl1NHVEcW9LNkVNUXdZNE1BcEd6UT0=": "X2fxnL8kAEwbpHyWmGml", "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin"}, "canonical_link": "https://arynews.tv/en/22-children-hostage-daughter-birthday-party/"}
