In \u2018Pigs,\u2019 when we put up that he has a bigger button and it works, it does. And it\u2019s working all over the world, murdering brown people for profit.\u201d\n\nDuring the Q&A the British rocker also trashed the United States, saying Trump\u2019s supporters have turned it into a \u201cfool\u2019s hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States of America is not a fool\u2019s paradise; it\u2019s a fool\u2019s hell,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd watching [the film], it reminded me that the great battle is the battle between propaganda and love. And propaganda is winning. And sadly, the buttons of the propaganda machine are being pushed by people who are fucking sick. These sick, sociopathic fuckers, all of them, every single one of them. Believe it or not, Donald Trump is somewhere down here, floundering around in the muddy water at the bottom of the oligarchic pool.\u201d\n\nDespite calling the United States \u201chell,\u201d Waters is planning to embark on a North American tour this year that will stop in US cities including New York, Los Angeles, Nashville, Atlanta, Orlando, Cincinnati, Raleigh, Milwaukee, and Minneapolis.\n\nRolling Stone reported that the audience of mostly progressives and New York media types then cheered when Rogers declared that Sen. Bernie Sanders could beat President Trump.\n\nHe said that if more Americans were passionate about politics, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t have Donald Trump as a president, you wouldn\u2019t be having all this nonsense with the Democratic primaries, with them trying to destroy the only candidate who can possibly win against Donald Trump, Sanders.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Baxter Dmitry"], "publish_date": "Fri Feb 14 15:40:03 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "British rocker Roger Waters of Pink Floyd slammed President Trump as a \u201ctyrant and mass murderer,\u201d and said the US is a \u201cfool\u2019s hell.\u201d", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "British rocker Roger Waters of Pink Floyd slammed President Trump as a \u201ctyrant and mass murderer,\u201d and said the US is a \u201cfool\u2019s hell.\u201d", "generator": "WPSSO UM 4.6.0/S", "wpsso-begin": "wpsso meta tags and schema markup begin", "fb": {"app_id": 187101705057657}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://newspunch.com/roger-waters-trump-mass-murderer-supporters-turned-usa-into-hell/", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "News Punch", "title": "British Rocker Roger Waters: Trump a \u2018Mass Murderer\u2019 and His Supporters Have Turned the USA Into \u2018Hell\u2019", "description": "British rocker Roger Waters says Trump supporters have turned America into \"hell,\" but he is still touring the US and lives in the Hamptons.", "updated_time": "2020-02-14T15:40:06+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Roger-waters-1200x630-cropped.jpg.optimal.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "British rocker Roger Waters of Pink Floyd slammed President Trump as a \u201ctyrant and mass murderer,\u201d and said the US is a \u201cfool\u2019s hell.\u201d"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thepeoplesvoicetv", "published_time": "2020-02-14T15:40:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-14T15:40:06+00:00", "section": "News"}, "twitter": {"domain": "newspunch.com", "site": "@realnewspunch", "title": "British Rocker Roger Waters: Trump a \u2018Mass Murderer\u2019 and His...", "description": "British rocker Roger Waters says Trump supporters have turned America into \"hell,\" but he is still touring the US and lives in the Hamptons.", "creator": "@baxter_dmitry", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Roger-waters-600x337.jpg.optimal.jpg?p=193206", "alt": "British rocker Roger Waters of Pink Floyd slammed President Trump as a \u201ctyrant and mass murderer,\u201d and said the US is a \u201cfool\u2019s hell.\u201d"}, "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Baxter Dmitry", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "author": "Baxter Dmitry", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Roger-waters-600x315-cropped.jpg.optimal.jpg", "wpsso-end": "wpsso meta tags and schema markup end", "wpsso-cached": "2021-10-01T04:18:53+00:00", "wpsso-added": "2021-10-01T04:18:53+00:00 in 0.049763 secs for https://newspunch.com"}, "canonical_link": "https://newspunch.com/roger-waters-trump-mass-murderer-supporters-turned-usa-into-hell/"}
