All COVID-19 patients in severe conditions should be treated at high-level designated hospitals.\n\nThe meeting also highlighted epidemic prevention and control in Beijing and other key regions.\n\nIt stressed the importance of intensifying epidemic-related scientific research, with strengths concentrated on tackling the most pressing issues.\n\nDifferentiated approaches should be adopted to help work and production resume in regions based on their epidemic situations. The production and supply of essential epidemic control materials should be substantially increased and distribution of protective gear be improved to ensure employees work and live in safe and healthy environment.\n\nThe meeting underscored unleashing consumption that had been suppressed by the outbreak and stressed the need to strengthen new and upgraded consumption to compensate the lost consumption on goods and services during the outbreak.\n\nIt also stressed stabilizing foreign trade and investment, assisting businesses, stabilizing employment, creating more jobs, helping college graduates and migrant workers find work, and solving difficulties for small household businesses.\n\nIn the meantime, agricultural production and stable prices of farm produce should be guaranteed.
