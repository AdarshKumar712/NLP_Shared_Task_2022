The first two qualified Johnson for the finale.\n\n\"The first two rounds are where everybody gets to go,\" Johnson said of the field of roughly 40 riders. \"Then the top 10 in the average get to go in the short round.\"\n\nJohnson stood at No. 6 going into the short round before improving with her final ride.\n\nCassidy Evans of Yuma, Colo., took the top spot at 60.383 (20.655, 19.775 and 19.953).\n\nJohnson, who lives in the Broadacres area, said she was happy with her performance in Las Vegas, and she looks forward to more competitions in the future.\n\n\"I think for my first time, it was pretty good,\" she said\n\nBut perhaps the most enjoyable part of the adventure was meeting people from all over the country.\n\n\"I got to meet a lot of different people from all kinds of places,\" Johnson said. \"There were some super-nice people from Mississippi, and pretty cool people from Texas. I met people from Pennsylvania and California. That was a lot of fun.\"\n\nJohnson, who turns 15 this month, is a member of the Oregon High School Rodeo where she competes as an all-around cowgirl in barrel racing, pole bending, team roping, breakaway roping and goat tying. She qualified for the Junior World Finals earlier in the year at a national rodeo held in Red Bluff, Calif.\n\nJunior World Finals\n\nPole Bending 17 and under results\n\n1.
