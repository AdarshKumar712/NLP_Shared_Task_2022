Why you may wonder?\n\nFirst and foremost because models in online collections are more ready-to-wear than couture, but also because they do not require the same number of fittings and alterations that are usually needed for bridal wear.\n\nAt the same time, many ready-to-wear brands such as La Redoute, H&M, Asos and C&A are now marketing ranges of wedding dresses and outfits, either independently or in collaboration with specialised houses, with models that retail for less than 200 euros online.\n\nInexpensively priced dresses like these are often an attractive option for brides-to-be who are eager to devote more of their wedding budget to other aspects of the big day such as the ceremony or the meal, for example.\n\nA positive gesture for the planet\n\nTaking into account the environment is more about choosing the right outfit than it is about buying online.\n\nAlthough for many they are a dream come true, more often than not custom wedding dresses see the light of day only once before being consigned to storage at the back of a closet, while less sophisticated models can be worn over and over again on a variety of different occasions.\n\nThis is especially the case for trousers and ensembles, which can be combined with casual pieces, and also dresses that are not traditional bridal wear but are nonetheless perfectly appropriate for the big day.\n\nAnother way to make a gesture for the planet is to opt for a vintage dress. Second-hand platforms, such as Vinted (Vinted.com) and Vestiaire Collective (Vestiairecollective.com), offer a wide variety of wedding dresses in perfect condition that might be just right for your big day.\n\n\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["bridal gown", "Covid-19", "online shopping", "lockdown"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Apr  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "There are quality models to choose from, with dresses to suit every taste.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/favi-16.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wedding-gown-lifestyle-010420-1.jpg", "url": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wedding-gown-lifestyle-010420-1.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wedding-gown-lifestyle-010420-1.jpg"}, "locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "Free Malaysia Today", "title": "3 fab reasons to order a bridal gown online in lockdown", "url": "https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2020/04/01/3-fab-reasons-to-order-a-bridal-gown-online-in-lockdown/", "type": "article", "description": "There are quality models to choose from, with dresses to suit every taste.", "updated_time": "2020-04-01T10:43:38+08:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.9.8", "google-site-verification": "dn60ivzklYS68Xl7DcN1A7ZVHF3V8e0ExnfXRUpQ93w", "msvalidate.01": "4A4AB0383C300DBBCDFF75814F1107F5", "article": {"published_time": "2020-04-01T10:43:38+08:00", "modified_time": "2020-04-01T10:43:38+08:00", "section": "Top Lifestyle"}, "fb": {"app_id": 193538481218906}, "twitter": {"title": "3 fab reasons to order a bridal gown online in lockdown", "url": "https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2020/04/01/3-fab-reasons-to-order-a-bridal-gown-online-in-lockdown/", "description": "There are quality models to choose from, with dresses to suit every taste.", "image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wedding-gown-lifestyle-010420-1.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@fmtoday"}, "description": "There are quality models to choose from, with dresses to suit every taste.", "publisher": "Free Malaysia Today"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2020/04/01/3-fab-reasons-to-order-a-bridal-gown-online-in-lockdown/"}
