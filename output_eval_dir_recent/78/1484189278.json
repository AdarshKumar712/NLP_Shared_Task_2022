Trump has a MagaHatty cadre of street fascists who can disrupt Town Hall candidate meetings, his billionaires. and Putin, his Internet Hacking Agency, and Russo-American \"Businessmen Corrupters.\" Winning against it will require that the Democratic party get at least 3 \"battleground states\" to adopt ranked-choice voting! The race is likely to come down to only five \"toss up\" states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Voters get to rank candidates in order of choice. If a candidate receives more than half of the first choices, they win, just like any other election. If not, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and voters who picked that candidate as 'number 1' will have their votes count for their next choice. This process continues until a candidate wins with more than half of the votes. This process is guaranteed to end with the most preferred candidate among all the votes as the winner candidate in our state situation it will produce a 270 vote electoral college. Second, rank and file democrats must, for this election only, abandon their self damaging diversity / identity theme, pitting women and minorities against each other! Make American values the main issue this time! Trumps' values are Vulgarian, from Slobovia and Skankostan! When Sanders says \"I'm a socialist\" only news media stupid talking heads claim it makes him un electable. Nobody sees Sanders virtue signaling this way as other than an expression of steadfastness, principle. Nobody thinks he alone, as President could make America a socialist nation. Furthermore, It would be stupid to scoff at the idea of another Hollywood actor running, like Ronald Reagan. Many of us did not like some of the values he stood for or some of his decisions. But no one could argue that he was ineffective, like Trump. A number of very prominent actors fit these qualities very well. Draft an actor who is a Democrat such as Tom Hanks! Hanks has exemplified good American values, in splendid films like Saving Private Ryan, Sully, Apollo 13, The Green Mile, Captain Phillips, Mark Felt, and A Beautiful Day Yes, even as Mr. Rogers! Try to draft Kevin Costner, who showed courage and other American values in Dances with Wolves, Robin Hood, JFK, A Perfect World, The Postman, Thirteen Days (about the Cuban Missile Crisis), The Guardian, and Hidden Figures. Or consider George Clooney who played in Three Kings, Syriana, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Good Night and Good Luck, The Ides of March and The Monuments Men. Even the writers of West Wing or Madame Secretary could do better and Tea Leoni would make a better President than Trump! Maybe even Pence, even for a caretaker year.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["2020", "Democrat", "Democrats", "Internet", "Putin", "Trump"], "tags": ["Putin", "Trump", "Democrat", "2020", "Democrats", "Internet"], "authors": ["Robert Cogan"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Article: Draft an American Values (Democrat) Actor for President (like Tom Hanks) - How to improve chance of winning the Presidency in 2020.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"description": "Article: Draft an American Values (Democrat) Actor for President (like Tom Hanks) - How to improve chance of winning the Presidency in 2020.", "keywords": "2020,Democrat,Democrats,Internet,Putin,Trump", "fb": {"admins": 737810614, "app_id": 157889207614942}, "generator": "Populum - \ufeffContent management software for hybrid blog/media/commerce communities", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"url": "https://www.opednews.com/articles/Draft-an-American-Values--by-Robert-Cogan-2020_Democrat_Democrats_Internet-191228-583.html", "site_name": "OpEdNews", "title": "Draft an American Values (Democrat) Actor for President (like Tom Hanks)", "description": "How to improve chance of winning the Presidency in 2020.", "image": {"identifier": "images/fblogo.gif", "width": 1024, "height": 1024}, "type": "website", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"title": "Draft an American Values (Democrat) Actor for President (like Tom Hanks)", "description": "How to improve chance of winning the Presidency in 2020.", "image": "images/fblogo.gif", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@opednews"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.opednews.com/articles/Draft-an-American-Values--by-Robert-Cogan-2020_Democrat_Democrats_Internet-191228-583.html"}
