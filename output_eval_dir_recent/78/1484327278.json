We'll look at Hotel Grand Central Limited's (SGX:H18) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Hotel Grand Central has a price to earnings ratio of 38.26, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 2.6%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Hotel Grand Central\n\nHow Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?\n\nThe formula for price to earnings is:\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share \u00f7 Earnings per Share (EPS)\n\nOr for Hotel Grand Central:\n\nP/E of 38.26 = SGD1.30 \u00f7 SGD0.03 (Based on the year to September 2019.)\n\nIs A High P/E Ratio Good?\n\nA higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.\n\nDoes Hotel Grand Central Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?\n\nWe can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (26.6) for companies in the hospitality industry is lower than Hotel Grand Central's P/E.\n\nSGX:H18 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020 More\n\nHotel Grand Central's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.\n\nHow Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios\n\nIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.\n\nHotel Grand Central shrunk earnings per share by 24% over the last year. And EPS is down 20% a year, over the last 3 years. This might lead to low expectations.\n\nRemember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance Sheet\n\nOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.\n\nSuch spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.\n\nHotel Grand Central's Balance Sheet\n\nHotel Grand Central has net cash of S$147m. This is fairly high at 16% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.\n\nThe Verdict On Hotel Grand Central's P/E Ratio\n\nHotel Grand Central has a P/E of 38.3. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 13.5. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.\n\nInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.
