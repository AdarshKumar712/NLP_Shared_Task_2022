Scottish football deserves a disciplinary process which is fair, consistent and fit for purpose.\u201d\n\nChristie will miss a Scottish Cup tie at Partick Thistle and league matches against Kilmarnock and Ross County, but was already doubtful for those games after undergoing groin surgery in the wake of Celtic\u2019s first home league defeat in 19 months.\n\n\u00a9 \u2013 AFP 2020\n\nThe42 is on Instagram!
