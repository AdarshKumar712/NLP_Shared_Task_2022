Deadline, which first reported the news Tuesday, indicates the project will have a budget in the $20 million range and will shoot on location this summer, with Film4 producing and Searchlight Pictures (formerly Fox Searchlight) handling worldwide distribution.\n\nMcDonagh previously worked with Farrell and Gleeson on the 2008 cult hit In Bruges, a black comedy about a hitman (Gleeson) who brings his friend and professional partner (Farrell) to the titular Belgian city to kill him after he botches an important job.\n\nFollowing its release, In Bruges earned glowing critical reviews before scoring McDonagh his first Best Original Screenplay nomination at the 2009 Oscars. He would receive a follow-up nomination in the category for 2017\u2019s Three Billboard Outside Ebbing, Missouri, in addition to landing his first Best Picture nod for the drama (which also won Frances McDormand her second Academy Award at the 2018 ceremony).\n\nA release date for the trio\u2019s new movie has yet to be announced.\n\nRelated content:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Brendan Gleeson", "Colin Farrell", "Martin McDonagh", "Searchlight Pictures"], "tags": ["Focus Features", "Colin Farrell", "Martin McDonagh", "Ralph Fiennes", "Brendan Gleeson"], "authors": ["Joey Nolfi"], "publish_date": "Tue Feb 18 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Writer-director Martin McDonagh will reunite with his 'In Bruges' stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson for a new movie.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Brendan Gleeson,Colin Farrell,Martin McDonagh,Searchlight Pictures", "news_keywords": "Brendan Gleeson,Colin Farrell,Martin McDonagh,Searchlight Pictures", "description": "Writer-director Martin McDonagh will reunite with his 'In Bruges' stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson for a new movie.", "og": {"title": "'In Bruges' stars Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson eyeing reunion with Martin McDonagh on new film", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2020/02/18/in-bruges-reunion-colin-farrell-martin-mcdonagh/", "description": "Farrell, Gleeson attached to star in Oscar-winning director's next movie.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2020%2F02%2Fmcdinbr_ec003.jpg%3Fcrop%3D0px%2C169px%2C2400px%2C1261px%26resize%3D1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2020/02/18/in-bruges-reunion-colin-farrell-martin-mcdonagh/", "description": "Writer-director Martin McDonagh will reunite with his 'In Bruges' stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson for a new movie.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2020%2F02%2Fmcdinbr_ec003.jpg%3Fcrop%3D0px%2C169px%2C2400px%2C1261px%26resize%3D1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2020/02/18/in-bruges-reunion-colin-farrell-martin-mcdonagh/", "title": "'In Bruges' stars Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson eyeing reunion with Martin McDonagh on new film", "description": "Writer-director Martin McDonagh will reunite with his 'In Bruges' stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson for a new movie.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2020%2F02%2Fmcdinbr_ec003.jpg%3Fcrop%3D0px%2C169px%2C2400px%2C1261px%26resize%3D1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2020/02/18/in-bruges-reunion-colin-farrell-martin-mcdonagh/"}
