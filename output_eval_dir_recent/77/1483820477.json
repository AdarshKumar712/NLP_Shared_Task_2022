One exception is this time, every year. In the following segments, you\u2019ll read what we believe to be the outlook for key elements of our industry for the next 12 months\u2014views inevitably shaped by the past, but with an eye toward what we believe is just beyond the immediate horizon.\n\nYou\u2019ll get our take on the immediate future of eVTOL, not the lofty aspirations of the over-optimistic, but the cold reality; the bubbling cauldron of election-year politics as it impacts our industry; 2020\u2019s outlook for what\u2019s in line for the FBO industry; what\u2019s on tap for OEMs in an ever-volatile market; avionics in the wake of the ADS-B (soft?) deadline; and what you can expect to see on the shop floors\u2014and in the order books\u2014of MROs.\n\nSo, how did we do last year? Here are some samples of what we were projecting for 2019:\n\neVTOL: \u201cEven if eVTOLs win public acceptance and clear regulatory and technological hurdles, can OEMs and service providers deliver the technology at a price the general public can afford?\u201d That remains the biggest open question in aviation.\n\n\n\nTouchscreens: \u201cIt won\u2019t be a surprise to see more manufacturers adopting this technology, especially as younger tech-savvy pilots move up the flying food chain to more sophisticated aircraft.\u201d Twelve months later, that seems on track.\n\nSupersonics: \u201cThrough 2019, Aerion and its partners will be initiating the process of selecting Tier 1 suppliers for the next phase of development.\u201d This predated the February 2019 announcement of Boeing\u2019s investment and involvement in the AS2 project. Since then, the program has gone largely silent.\n\nCome January 2021, we\u2019ll take another look back at this year\u2019s look forward.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["aviation news"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Dec 30 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "AIN takes its annual look ahead at key elements of the aviation industry", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.ainonline.com/misc/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0", "description": "AIN takes its annual look ahead at key elements of the aviation industry", "keywords": "aviation news", "news_keywords": "aviation news,Aerospace,,,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "fb": {"app_id": 257027008006370}, "og": {"site_name": "Aviation International News", "type": "article", "title": "Our 2020 Vision:", "url": "https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aerospace/2019-12-30/our-2020-vision", "description": "AIN takes its annual look ahead at key elements of the aviation industry", "image": "http://www.ainonline.com/sites/ainonline.com/themes/ain30/images/ain-logo-social-media-400x400.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": {"identifier": "@AINonline", "id": 26333067}, "url": "https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aerospace/2019-12-30/our-2020-vision", "title": "Our 2020 Vision:", "description": "AIN takes its annual look ahead at key elements of the aviation industry", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "AINonline", "ipad": "AINonline"}, "id": {"iphone": 370742533, "ipad": 370742533}}}, "msvalidate.01": "879F91EDE9B537D93E8712033BB6CF2D", "google-site-verification": "1yXlZ9dBp5mejB3SA4QZgraAeg7S1DIVOlqfghR0U8U", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "AINonline", "application-name": "AINonline", "msapplication-TileColor": "#b91d47", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/ainonline.com/themes/ain30/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "/sites/ainonline.com/themes/ain30/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aerospace/2019-12-30/our-2020-vision"}
