Cross-platform titles such as Mario Kart Tour on iOS and Android, a general increase in smartphone users and improvements to hardware and infrastructure are factors that will lead to the projected growth, according to the firm.\n\nThe console segment, on the other hand, is set to reach US$61.1 billion in 2022, Newzoo estimates, boosted by the upcoming generation of Xbox and PlayStation systems, created by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SNE,TSE:6758), respectively.\n\nPC gaming will be a bit slower in the coming years, according to the researchers, though it is gaining traction and could be valued at US$39.5 billion over the next two year period.\n\nIn a previous interview with INN, Erik Dekker, senior vice president and portfolio manager with Dekker Hewett Group at Canaccord Genuity, said, \u201cGaming is bigger than film box offices, bigger than television, bigger than digital music. I think it\u2019s about a US$116 billion market at this time.\u201d\n\nGaming outlook 2020: The growth of team organizations\n\nIn esports, organizations like Team Liquid and OG are big generators of cash for the industry. Team Liquid, which has teams in many of the top esports leagues, currently has a merchandise collaboration with Marvel, and OG just announced a Counter Strike: Global Offensive team following its big Dota 2 win.\n\nTeam support and attachment have been reflected in the sheer amount of interest in gaming tournaments, another important revenue stream for esport companies.\n\nIn August, the Dota 2 The International 9 tournament had the world\u2019s largest prize pool in history at a whopping US$34.3 million in winnings, and OG took home the top prize.\n\nBut organizations are evolving to rely on more than just their athletes and tournaments \u2014 instead, they\u2019re taking a holistic approach to branding and maintaining a public image.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to ultimately come down to teams that can create brand lifestyles, create great content programming and diversify the revenue streams to find more profitability,\u201d Daniel Mitre, CEO of New Wave Esports (CSE:NWES), told INN via email.\n\nMitre said the impressive growth of the sector has already led heavy hitters in gaming to throw their hats into the ring. The executive explained that companies like Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Riot Games, a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate Tencent (HKEX:0700), have carefully crafted plans attached to their esports franchises and leagues.\n\n\u201cNone of this movement around big games, AAA publishers and developers is coming to a slow,\u201d said Mitre. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s just going to start picking up further.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment was shared by another expert in gaming who is optimistic about the market\u2019s trajectory.\n\nHaywood Securities investment banker Sean MacGillis said the skill of the gaming industry is in the flexibility of its revenue channels, which include everything from merchandise and ticket sales to advertising and sponsorship revenue.\n\n\u201cThe ability to monetize games is an order of magnitude larger than the ability to monetize traditional forms of content,\u201d MacGillis explained.\n\nGaming outlook 2020: Possible concerns in the new year\n\nSome experts have noted possible pitfalls for the industry, despite its recent levels of success.\n\nFor Nick Mersch, associate portfolio manager at Purpose Investments, the biggest risks for the space could come with the hypothetical collapse of the Overwatch League, one of the biggest leagues in the sector. Mersch said a downturn for the league could turn off existing and prospective investors.\n\n\u201cA lot of traditional sports owners wrote huge checks into teams in this league, and if they get burned here it will be difficult to attract capital back to the space,\u201d Mersch told INN.\n\nAccording to a report from Variety, viewers for the Overwatch League Grand Finals grew by 16 percent in 2019, with the event reaching 1.12 million average viewers.\n\nMersch said he\u2019s also keeping his eye on the overvaluation that has plagued esports, pointing to a recent Forbes list ranking \u201cthe most valuable companies in esports\u201d that still seems to exaggerate the values of some organizations on it, according to the expert.\n\nOther concerns have larger political implications. The ongoing US-China trade war dampened the growth of the sector, according to Trevor Doerksen, CEO of ePlay Digital (CSE:EPY), and could continue to do so into 2020, especially given China\u2019s place as one of the world\u2019s largest hubs for gaming.\n\nIn 2019, it was projected that US$36.5 billion was spent on gaming in China, according to Newzoo.\n\n\u201cGeopolitical forces and the US-China trade war muted global collaboration and access to markets, and important data that would help better understand and grow esports in 2019,\u201d said Doerksen.\n\nThe executive said there could be better access to content, games and data across both markets if the relationship between the two countries improves in 2020.\n\nGaming outlook 2020: Investor takeaway\n\nMersch said moving forward, the most important factor for gaming will be the work done by data firm Nielsen, owned by The Nielsen Company (NYSE:NLSN), in its esports division, which works to get accurate information on engagement and viewership data.\n\nIn his view, Nielsen\u2019s work could help close the existing gap between how the industry is growing and how it\u2019s monetizing that growth, Mersch told INN.\n\n\u201cTo close this gap, Fortune 500 companies need actionable return of investment metrics in order to justify more (spending) in the space. Nielsen and other data analytic companies can provide this.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the overall health within the sector, Mitre told INN that the increasing popularity of gaming and its viewership will help in building a strong foundation for an interesting investment market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had this propensity to watch people play better than us, whether it\u2019s standing at the arcade and watching someone play Street Fighter, or the emergence of a Twitch and YouTube influencer space watching other people play video games,\u201d said Mitre.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to follow us @INN_Technology for real-time news updates!\n\nSecurities Disclosure: I, Danielle Edwards, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this article.\n\nEditorial Disclosure: The Investing News Network does not guarantee the accuracy or thoroughness of the information reported in the interviews it conducts.
