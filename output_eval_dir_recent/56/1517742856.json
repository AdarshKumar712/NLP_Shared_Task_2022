But many others of its factories have yet to resume operation.\n\nHuawei, China\u2019s biggest smartphone vendor, said its manufacturing capacity is \u201crunning normally\u201d without specifying further. But like many other local peers, Huawei relies heavily on third-party manufacturers for production.\n\nIf factories cannot resume production to full capacity on time, this could delay brands\u2019 ability to bring their newest products to market, analysts said.\n\nXiaomi Corp, Huawei, and Oppo, three of China\u2019s top Android brands, are all expected to announce flagship devices in the first half.\n\nOppo told Reuters that while the impact of the virus will affect operations at some local factories, \u201cmanufacturing capacity can be guaranteed effectively\u201d thanks to its plants overseas.\n\nXiaomi did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cThe delays in reopening factories and the labor return time will not only affect shipments to stores, it will also affect the product launch times in the mid- and long-term,\u201d Will Wong, an IDC analyst, said.
