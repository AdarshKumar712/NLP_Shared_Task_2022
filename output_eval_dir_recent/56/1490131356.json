Unauthorized goods were also found in other cells, but not specified.\n\nAccording to Monsalve\u2019s defense attorney, Carlos Arturo Toro, his client is the victim of a persecution for his cooperation with justice over the Uribe family\u2019s allegedly criminal past.\n\nSuspicions\n\nCable Noticias reported that the inspection had been ordered by Justice Minister Margarita Cabello, an ally of Uribe, but the minister denied this.\n\n\u201cInstead of looking at the irregularities and abuses committed by him and many others deprived of their liberty, they are diverting opinion to something absurd,\u201d the minister said.\n\nEl Espectador columnist and Uribe critic Jorge Gomez asked on Twitter why INPEC was investigating Monsalve instead of the officials allegedly bringing unauthorized goods into the prison, a common form of corruption in Colombia\u2019s prisons.\n\nOn Tuesday, INPEC said that the alleged finds in Monsalve\u2019s cell were just few of many made during a month-long operation in multiple prisons where, among other things, 374 cellphones and 553 knives were found.\n\nEl Espectador reported that the prison authority would be investigating corruption among prison wardens.\n\n\u201cSuicide by Uribe\u201d\n\nMonsalve was put in the specially protected wing of La Picota, Bogota\u2018s main prison, at the order of the Supreme Court after another witness in one of the multiple cases against the former president was assassinated.\n\nThe former paramilitary, who is one of two surviving witnesses who claimed the Uribe family founded the Bloque Metro death squad, survived two assassination attempts.\n\nThe announcement triggered suspicion, especially after Mujica indicated he was considering moving Monsalve to a different prison.\n\n\u201cThat may not be used as pretext to reduce of remove the special protection measures,\u201d the former paramilitary\u2019s attorney told newspaper El Tiempo.\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently investigating Uribe for the alleged manipulating of witnesses who have tied the former president and his brother Santiago to organized crime.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Alvaro Uribe", "Uribe trial", "Inpec", "Juan Guillermo Monsalve"], "authors": ["Adriaan Alsema"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  8 11:00:43 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://colombiareports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fav_cr.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Colombia's prison authority considering sanctions against key witness against Uribe", "description": "Colombia\u2019s prison authority has said it could move a key witness against former President Alvaro Uribe out of his protected cell block, triggering concerns about his safety.
