Igel\n\nThe Olympics are a setting in which dreams of a lifetime come true. So, despite the COVID-19 pandemic bearing down on the world, few could fault the International Olympic Committee for continuing to plan on the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympic Games going off on-schedule. But reality needs to set in now. The Games need to be rescheduled.\n\nLate this past week, IOC president Thomas Bach said that deciding on postponement \u201cwould not be responsible now and it would be premature to start speculation\u201d at this point in time . Most organizing officials in Tokyo and around the world are hanging on to the same opinion. Opening ceremonies being some four months away for the once-every-four-years global festival gives the kind of lead time that officials hope will let the games go on. Plus, Japan\u2014and Tokyo, one of the busiest metropolises in the world\u2014have been managing the coronavirus disease outbreak fairly well.\n\nJapan was one of the first nations outside of China to see cases of COVID-19 show up in its population. But the spread has so far been largely contained. Of the nearly 288,000 confirmed cases around the world recorded by real-time tracking at the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering as of March 21, Japan reported less than 1,000 confirmed cases among a population of about 128,000,000. By comparison, Italy has already recorded 4-times as many deaths due to the virus disease in its population of about 61,000,000 people.\n\nStill, what happens to available resources and attention if Japan has an outbreak before the Olympics? What happens if\u2014perish the thought\u2014Japan has an outbreak during the Olympics?\n\nMany people, locked-down in their homes, might prefer to see the games go on as scheduled. Athletes and their family members, sponsors and advertisers, broadcasters and reporters, visitors and residents have had the two-week-long sports mega-event circled on their calendars for years. But even if the current condition in Japan could be maintained, there is the matter of what is happening in most of the 206 nations that are represented at Olympic Games.\n\nGovernment-ordered public health measures are already the norm in the United States, Great Britain, China, Russia, Germany, Japan, France, South Korea, Italy, and Australia, which make up the Top 10 medal-winning countries at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics . Could delegations from these nations even get to Tokyo? In increasing instances, people are being ordered not to travel outside their homes except to buy groceries and other necessities.\n\nLockdowns, quarantines, \u201cshelter in place,\u201d and social distancing directives mean athletes and coaches will have to continue staying at home for several weeks. They will not have access to their usual training facilities and regimens. And even if they could travel to a training facility, they shouldn't.\n\nThe same goes for pretty much everyone else who helps make an Olympic Games. Most of the people who make up the global and local crews that ensure the events, infrastructure, technology, and security are running\u2014and smoothly\u2014won't be permitted to travel. And they shouldn't do so even if they were cleared to go to their work stations in the interest of keeping the Games on schedule.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the preliminary qualifying events are quickly becoming history, sidelined when sport after sport cancelled events during the past several weeks. With events being cancelled, athletes unable to get to the ones that are still on, and countries closing their training facilities, the best athletes won\u2019t be in Tokyo. We will end up with a faux Olympics.\n\nMany Olympic athletes are not in high risk groups for developing COVID-19 illnesses. But plenty of coaches, training staff, delegates, and fans are in that category. Exposing them to deadly risk for a watered-down Olympics is hard to justify. And it would be something else altogether if, heaven forbid, there was to be an outbreak during the Games. The health care system in Japan could easily be overwhelmed, putting many people at huge risk\u2014the Olympics does not come with its own set of hospitals, ventilators, gloves, moonsuits, and beds.\n\nInformation flowing in from epidemiologists, infectious disease experts, hospital emergency department staffs, statisticians, and behavioral scientists indicates that COVID-19 and its effects will still be with us well past this July. Artificial intelligence models relate the same. The chance of medical science discovering a cure by mid-summer is remote and a vaccine will not yet have been developed. Nations around the world will still be working to \u201cflatten the curve,\u201d managing the pandemic and trying to get us to modify our behaviors in ways that reduce infectivity.\n\nThere is nothing typical or easy about changing the schedule of an event of literally Olympic proportion, especially so close to the start of it. But there is nothing typical or easy about what we are witnessing across the world, with major parts of societies and economies at a standstill or shutdown entirely.\n\nOlympic and Paralympic committees of some nations are starting to publicly call for the Games to be postponed. Sport organizing bodies and individual athletes are doing the same. Those are not decisions to be taken lightly given what they each have at stake personally, financially, politically, and socially.\n\nThe 2020 Tokyo Games are set to cost organizers alone at least $26-billion. Decisions about things on that level rarely come quickly and easily. But COVID-19 is spreading quickly and easily\u2014and it is not waiting on individuals and organizations contemplating months-long lead times.\n\nIt is time to do the right thing. Knowing what we know, there is one only one right response: postpone the 2020 Summer Olympics.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["coronavirus", "COVID-19", "Olympics", "International Olympic Committee", "IOC", "Tokyo", "Japan", "sports", "pandemic", "health care", "vaccine", "Johns Hopkins", "Lockdown", "quarantine", "shelter in place", "social distancing"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Lee Igel"], "publish_date": "Sat Mar 21 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Given the COVID-19 pandemic, reality needs to set in now about plans for the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympic Games to go on as scheduled.
