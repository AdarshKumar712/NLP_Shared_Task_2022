That is exactly what Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu declared when claiming he had won the recent Israeli elections when he said that he won among the\u201dZionist\u201d voters because \u201cArabs are not part of the equation.\u201d Let that sink in. The reason Palestinian citizens of Israel are a minority is only because during its creation, 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed from their homeland through Zionist terror.\n\nBy \u2018Zionist\u2019 Netanyahu refers to Jews, an equivalence we are told should not be made because it is used by some to hide their anti-Jewish sentiments. At a stroke, Netanyahu delegitimised the votes of 300,000 of Israel\u2019s own citizens because they are not Jewish and would not vote for him.\n\nNetanyahu has form when it comes to racism against non-Jewish citizens from his country. In an election day video in 2015 he urged his supporters to go out and vote because \u201cthe rule of the right is in danger, Arab voters are coming in droves to the ballot boxes,\u201d Netanyahu declared in the video. \u201cLeft-wing NGOs are bringing them in buses.\u201d\n\nHowever, in quite a hypocritical U-turn after winning the election, Netanyahu decided to reach out to the Palestinian citizens of Israel offering a half-hearted apology. He said \u201cI know the things I said several days ago offended some of Israel\u2019s citizens, hurt the Arab citizens,\u201d Netanyahu told invited representatives of the Arab community at the Prime Minister\u2019s Residence in Jerusalem. \u201cThis was never my intent. I apologize for this.\u201d\n\nThis was rejected by Joint List leader Ayman Odeh who called the apology a duplicitous \u201cflip-flop.\u201d So long as Netanyahu \u201cadvances racist legislation\u2026 and does not promote real equality\u201d for Israel\u2019s Arabs, said the MK, the prime minister\u2019s apology would not be acceptable or credible.\n\nBoth episodes in 2015 and recently show the racism that is at the core of Netanyahu\u2019s and the right-wing coalition ideology. Palestinian citizens of Israel are at best second class citizens. In 2018, Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman on accused the leader of the Joint (Arab) List MK, Ayman Odeh, and his associates of being a \u201cfifth column\u201d and said they should be \u201coutlawed\u201d for their support of a Gaza solidarity protest in Haifa. Lieberman lamented the \u201csystematic failure\u201d of law enforcement to take action against Odeh \u201cand his friends\u201d and called for them to be \u201coutlawed.\u201d\n\nREAD: BDS Movement marks demise of Israel\u2019s culinary propaganda initiative\n\nCurrent Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennet has also revelled in his racism against Palestinians, claiming in 2013, \u201cI\u2019ve killed lots of Arabs in my life \u2013 and there\u2019s no problem with that.\u201d In 2017 as Education Minister, he told MKs of Palestinian origin to choose to be either \u2018normal Israelis\u2019 or \u2018terrorists\u2019. Bennett also believes that Palestinians \u2018already have their state in Jordan\u2019.\n\nBlue and White (Kahol Lavan) leader Benny Gantz would not contemplate forming a government with the Joint Arab List claiming he is not \u201cafraid to speak to any legitimate political party, but the Joint List will not be part of the government I form.\u201d He said, \u201cmy disagreements with its leadership on the national and security issues are deep, difficult and unbridgeable,\u201d. He continued, \u201cI intend to implement President Trump\u2019s peace plan, in coordination with all the elements in the region, and see it as a significant milestone.\u201d Israel \u201ccannot tolerate support for terrorism or avoid condemnation,\u201d Gantz said.\n\nGantz did not object to the inclusion in Trump\u2019s plan a provision to strip 300,000 Palestinian Israeli citizens of their citizenship in \u2018land swaps\u2019, that would see the area known as the \u2018Triangle\u2019 become part of the so called Palestinian state, without asking that population for it\u2019s views.\n\nNone of the above discrimination and shear racism against Palestinians and Palestinian citizens of Israel should surprise us. Israel has over sixty laws that discriminate against its Palestinian citizens and Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. And most were implemented before Israel\u2019s main political leadership either drafted or supported in the Knesset in 2018 the \u2018Nation State Law\u2019 or as I called it Israel\u2019s \u201cJewish State Apartheid Law\u201d when it was passed. At its core is the premise that only Jews have a right to self-determination in Israel, whatever Israel\u2019s borders are. In Trump\u2019s plan it is clear that Israel \u2018security border is the whole of historic Palestine, from the river Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe question of whether Israel is an Apartheid state was settled in the ESCWA report, which was commissioned to assess in an academic manner by eminent academics Richard Falk and Virginia Tilley. They concluded in the peer reviewed report that Israel exercised Apartheid against the Palestinian people as a whole. And before the usual suspects rubbish the report\u2019s status because ESCWA was asked to take it down from its website, let me assure them about its status.\n\nREAD: Palestinian boycott movement slams Austrian parliament anti-BDS motion\n\nI asked former Under-Secretary-General Dr Rima Khalaf who resigned rather than take it down, she assured me that it is still an official UN report. Therefore, its conclusions stand. Israel is an Apartheid state, which should be isolated and shunned until its racist regime is dismantled, leading either to two independent, sovereign states, an Israeli and Palestinian state, or a single democratic state for all those it rules over between the river and the sea.\n\nIsrael cannot for ever continue to rule over half the people whose lives it controls on a daily basis, without giving them their legitimate rights and claim to be a democracy. Judging by the violent past 72 years since its creation, it will not have peace until it either separates Jews from others or accepts that all human beings are entitled to be treated equally and accept it cannot be Jewish and Democratic.\n\nAnd here it cannot claim the problem is with the Palestinians who will not lie down and surrender. Neither can its backers in the West.\n\nIt is the same Western governments which sided with the oppressive Apartheid regime in South Africa that are siding with and protecting the Apartheid regime in Israel. Instead of sanctioning it for its crimes, the West bolsters trade with Israel and simply condemns its criminal actions as an illegal occupier who is commits war crimes almost on a daily basis at least in terms of its settlement enterprise. And when the Palestinians seek redress through peaceful, legal means and take the settlement file to the International Criminal Court (ICC), Israel\u2019s backers the US, Germany and Canada ask it not do so by claiming it does not have jurisdiction over Palestine because it is not a state.\n\nWhen the Palestinians call for peaceful Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), the US and France pass anti-BDS laws and France equates BDS to anti-Semitism. The UK has tried to ban pension funds from divestment from companies complicit in Israel\u2019s crimes and the Conservative Government only had Israel in mind when announcing it would legislate against boycotts by public bodies in its manifesto. It has also committed to forcing public bodies, including universities to adopt the flawed IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism, which has more to do with shielding Israel from criticism than it does protecting British Jews from real anti-Semitism. That is also the reason why Israel\u2019s advocates have tried and failed to cancel Israel Apartheid Week on campuses across the world.\n\nIt seems the so-called international community is sending not mixed but rather clear signals to the Palestinians. They stand with Israeli Apartheid and against Palestinian rights. This is hypocrisy on heat.\n\nProfessor Kamel Hawwash is a British Palestinian engineering academic based at the University of Birmingham.
