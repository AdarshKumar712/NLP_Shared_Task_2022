It is not a trivial matter such as a chicken or a goat has gone missing in a kampung where the matter can be settled with a sumpah (oath)\".", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["MALAYSIA", "ISLAM", "MURDER/MANSLAUGHTER", "NAJIB RAZAK"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 23:35:49 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman..
