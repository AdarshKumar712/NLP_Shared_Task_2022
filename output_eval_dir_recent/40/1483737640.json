Don\u2019t show up late.\n\nYou learned this in first grade, when the teacher began keeping track of tardies: Being on time matters. Especially in a new job. In fact, showing up late on the first day (or even in the first few weeks) is guaranteed to make a negative impression.\n\nTo ensure you\u2019ll be on time, test drive the route to your new job before you start so you\u2019ll know how long it takes to get there. Factor in extra time if there\u2019s traffic, construction, or other reasons to expect a delay.\n\n2. Don\u2019t dress unprofessionally.\n\nBefore starting your job, talk with the hiring manager or human resources professional to make sure you understand what constitutes acceptable attire for your new workplace.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing more embarrassing than showing up in a getup that doesn\u2019t fly with your supervisors \u2014 and making an unprofessional first impression.\n\n3. Don\u2019t blow off orientation.\n\nMany companies require new employees to go through an orientation or training process before starting a new position. While it may be tempting to skip these sessions or treat them lightly, don\u2019t do it.\n\nEven if your training managers won\u2019t be your direct supervisors, they are watching you. Avoid any behavior that could prompt a training manager to report your behavior back to your boss and team members.\n\n4. Don\u2019t expect hand-holding.\n\nNo matter where you\u2019re working, there are certain processes, tools, and forms that make up the standard operating procedures of your company.\n\nYou may have been introduced to these through a very organized, systematic orientation, or you may feel like you\u2019re expected to absorb them by osmosis.\n\nIf you were formally informed, \u201cconsider yourself fortunate,\u201d writes Heather Huhman, Glassdoor career and workplace expert.\n\n\u201cIf not, don\u2019t feel shortchanged or frustrated. Instead, take initiative and master the basics on your own.\u201d\n\n5. Don\u2019t ask co-workers to do your work.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that you may need help or guidance during your first few weeks at a new job, and asking co-workers for assistance or just to answer questions can be perfectly acceptable.\n\nBut there\u2019s no quicker way to make enemies than to ask or expect your new co-workers to do your job for you.\n\nRemember, you were hired because managers believed in your ability to get the job done. Ask for help if you need it, but believe in yourself and prove that you can do the work yourself.\n\n6. Don\u2019t take too many personal calls.\n\nThe time you spend at work is for, well, work. Your employer isn\u2019t paying you to chat with your girlfriend or even your kids\u2019 babysitter.\n\nIf friends or family members are prone to call you during working hours, remind them before you start your new job that you will now be working during certain hours and request that they avoid calling you during those hours.\n\nMake a personal policy of limiting personal phone calls and texts to your lunch break, except for during emergencies.\n\n7. Don\u2019t ask for more money.\n\nMost likely, you and your employer agreed to a certain salary during the hiring process. So don\u2019t change your mind before you even show up at work. If you agreed to the salary offered, be satisfied with that.\n\nDon\u2019t expect more money (and don\u2019t ask for more) until you\u2019ve worked long enough to prove your value to the employer.\n\n8. Don\u2019t try to change things.\n\nOf course you want to make a good impression as soon as you arrive at a new job, and show your new employer they made the right choice in hiring you.\n\nHowever, be cautious of suggesting new policies or strategies during your first few weeks, as it may not be the best way to demonstrate you are a team player. Plus, it could prompt some of your new co-workers to think twice about you as the right person for the job.\n\nAt first, take time to really understand and learn your job, then over time, you can make suggestions and changes as situations arise, and as your input and expertise is called upon.\n\n9. Don\u2019t be dishonest.\n\nIn a new job, there will always be a learning curve, and effective supervisors understand that. Inevitably, you\u2019ll be asked to do something or expected to know something that you don\u2019t yet know or know how to do. Rather than saying you can complete the task on your own, be honest. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019\u201d Huhman writes.\n\n\u201cHonesty is a huge differentiator. Simply look people in the eye and say unabashedly and with confidence, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Let me find out and get back to you. Then do it.\u201d\n\n10. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help.\n\nYou may be so eager to start your new job that you don\u2019t want to stop and ask questions. But by skipping even the most basic questions, you are setting yourself up for failure.\n\nRather than making a mistake that could cost the company time and money, ask questions about everything you need to know, from what your job responsibilities are to who can help you with Internet or phone problems, to how you get paid and much more.\n\nBy following these tips from Glassdoor, you\u2019ll be on your way to keeping your job and impressing your boss and co-workers.\n\nRead: Microsoft conducted a 4-day workweek experiment \u2013 here\u2019s what happened", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["business", "technology", "business technology", "Glassdoor", "Headline", "Business"], "tags": ["Glassdoor", "Headline"], "authors": ["Staff Writer"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Congratulations!
