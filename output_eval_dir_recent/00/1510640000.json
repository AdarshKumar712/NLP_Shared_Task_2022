She watched helplessly as pro-EU lawmakers, aided by assertive Commons Speaker John Bercow, seized control of Parliament\u2019s agenda to try to force a change of course. But May\u2019s opponents couldn\u2019t agree on what to do, either.\n\nMay\u2019s own Conservative lawmakers tried to depose her, but she hung on. The first Brexit day, long scheduled for March 29, 2019, was postponed to Oct. 31 of that year, and May was finally forced to admit defeat. She quit and was replaced in July 2019 by Johnson, a politician better known as someone who can entertain but not necessarily deliver.\n\nAt first, he faced the same paralysis. In a bid to break the deadlock, he suspended Parliament, a political nuclear option that was immediately challenged in the courts.\n\nBrexit perhaps reached peak mayhem on Sept. 24, 2019. Johnson, in New York to address the U.N. General Assembly, learned at 5 a.m. that the U.K. Supreme Court had ruled that he'd broken the law and misled Queen Elizabeth II by misleading her about the reason for the suspension. Johnson argued it was routine, but the court ruled he was trying to avoid scrutiny of his Brexit plans.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["", "wire", "politics", "general news", "government and politics", "business", "legislature", "brexit referendum", "brexit", "parliamentary elections", "elections", "recreational running", "recreational sports", "outdoor recreation", "recreation and leisure", "lifestyle"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jill Lawless Associated Press", "Francisco Seco", "Evan Vucci", "Matt Dunham", "Stefan Rousseau", "Frank Augstein", "Kirsty Wigglesworth", "Christophe Petit Tesson", "Alastair Grant", "Virginia Mayo"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 So this is the way Britain\u2019s European Union membership ends: Not with Big Ben\u2019s bong, but with a whimper.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://globegazette.com/content/tncms/site/icon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": ", wire, politics, general news, government and politics, business, legislature, brexit referendum, brexit, parliamentary elections, elections, recreational running, recreational sports, outdoor recreation, recreation and leisure, lifestyle", "news_keywords": ", wire, politics, general news, government and politics, business, legislature, brexit referendum, brexit, parliamentary elections, elections, recreational running, recreational sports, outdoor recreation, recreation and leisure, lifestyle", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 So this is the way Britain\u2019s European Union membership ends: Not with Big Ben\u2019s bong, but with a whimper.", "author": "JILL LAWLESS Associated Press", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=437581408", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.globegazette.news", "googlebot": "noarchive", "google-site-verification": "_As_f7gitKA5YkXZrMgIu7WOs7h0VYaavTdsfzPzaXk", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://globegazette.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/brexit-reflections-a-bumpy-ride-down-a-long-winding-road/article_038ff3e1-4407-5eab-9db7-c1c29b23b902.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/globegazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/a0/9a0ad23d-7c10-5739-8e6f-b2348ccfa61c/5e3416c688987.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C992%2C0%2C91&resize=1120%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "width": 1120, "height": 630}, "title": "Brexit reflections: A bumpy ride down a long, winding road", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 So this is the way Britain\u2019s European Union membership ends: Not with Big Ben\u2019s bong, but with a whimper.", "site_name": "Mason City Globe Gazette", "section": "National Politics"}, "fb": {"pages": 289040351411}, "parsely-title": "Brexit reflections: A bumpy ride down a long, winding road", "parsely-link": "https://globegazette.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/brexit-reflections-a-bumpy-ride-down-a-long-winding-road/article_038ff3e1-4407-5eab-9db7-c1c29b23b902.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-01-31T05:40:09-0600", "parsely-post-id": "038ff3e1-4407-5eab-9db7-c1c29b23b902", "parsely-image-url": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/globegazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/a0/9a0ad23d-7c10-5739-8e6f-b2348ccfa61c/5e3416c688987.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C992%2C0%2C91&resize=1120%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "parsely-author": "JILL LAWLESS Associated Press", "parsely-section": "National Politics", "parsely-tags": ", wire, politics, general news, government and politics, business, legislature, brexit referendum, brexit, parliamentary elections, elections, recreational running, recreational sports, outdoor recreation, recreation and leisure, lifestyle, ap"}, "canonical_link": "https://apnews.com/ea61ecd1146a3aabd06d3bc233113cd3"}
