Her name is Jennifer,\u201d Kimmel said before surprising the nurse with The Morning Show star.\n\nKeep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here.\n\n\u201cHi, honey, it\u2019s so good to meet you,\u201d Aniston told Fairbanks. \u201cI just have to say, God bless you and all of you that are out there doing what you\u2019re doing. I just, I don\u2019t even know how to express my gratitude to everything that you guys are doing, putting your health at risk and all of that. You\u2019re just phenomenal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, thank you,\u201d said a clearly shocked Fairbanks. \u201cI really appreciate that.\u201d\n\nAniston\u2019s presence wasn\u2019t her only present for the nurse, though. After Kimmel asked Fairbanks how she has been feeding herself during her illness, the nurse said she\u2019s been mainly ordering delivery. That\u2019s when Kimmel and the Friends actress told the nurse she was receiving a $10,000 gift card from the delivery company Postmates. \u201cBut you have to use it all in one shot,\u201d joked Kimmel, before adding that each of the nurses on Fairbanks\u2019 floor will also receive Postmates gift cards.\n\nWatch Jennifer Aniston on Jimmy Kimmel Live! below.\n\nPlease send any tips, leads, and stories to virus@time.com\n\nThe Coronavirus Brief.
