The third Moon mission is estimated to cost more than Rs 600 crore.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Isro chairman K Sivan said: \u201cWe are looking at a launch this year, but it may spillover to early next year. Chandrayaan-3 will have a lander, rover and a propulsion module given that the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter is fully functional. The government has approved the project and we have formed the project team.\u201dBreaking up the cost, Sivan said that the lander, rover and propulsion module will cost Rs 250 crore, while launch service will cost another Rs 365 crore. \u201cTogether the cost would be Rs 615 crore,\u201d he said, while another official told TOI that the internal target set for the crucial launch is November 2020. On Tuesday, agencies quoted Union minister Jitendra Singh saying that the launch will take place this year.TOI was the first to report that Isro had begun work on Chandrayaan-3 and M Vanitha, the project director of Chandrayaan-2 has been transferred making way for P Veeramuthuvel.Confirming this, Sivan said: \u201cIt is an Isro team, everybody is from our organisation. Yes, Veeramuthuvel has been identified as the project director. He was also associated with the Chandrayaan-2 mission.\u201dAllaying concerns that big-ticket projects like Chandrayaan-3, Gaganyaan and Aditya (Sun mission) will hamper other missions the space agency has in its pipeline, Sivan said that there is no stress on Isro resources and that work will happen simultaneously.\u201cWe are looking at more than 25 missions this year and are confident that each project work will happen simultaneously,\u201d Sivan said.Sivan had, in January 2019, set a target of about 30 missions for the year, but Isro managed only 13. \u201cIt was not because we were doing Chandrayaan, but because there was a delay in the supply of equipment needed for satellite missions,\u201d Sivan added.Another senior official said that the Indian industry must improve the quality of electronic equipment to meet the agency\u2019s current demand. \u201cEarlier, we never spoke of numbers, but now we can assure that, and yet, we don\u2019t have a good response from the industry,\u201d the official said.Isro has demanded Rs 14,000 crore in the next budget (2020-21), Sivan said, and added that among the big projects in 2020 are: \u201cLand acquisition for the second spaceport in Tamil Nadu\u2019s Kulasekarapattinam in Tuticorin ... We will need about 2,300 acres for this.\u201dIsro has already requested for Rs 120 crore for a new launchpad for SSLV (small satellite launch vehicle), which will be part of this proposed spaceport. Tamil Nadu government will acquire the land and transfer it to Isro. Sivan also said the first experimental flight of SSLV will happen this year at Sriharikota, while Aditya mission is scheduled for mid-2020.\u201cWe\u2019ve also made progress with letting private players build PSLV, and we will enhance their participation even with SSLV,\u201d he said.He added that the international agency regulating use of GPS-like systems in mobile phones has approved NaVIC \u2014 India\u2019s own version of GPS \u2014 for use in mobiles.\u201cNaVIC will soon be available for mobile phones. US chipmaker Qualcomm has collaborated with Isro on this,\u201d Sivan said.In Video: Over 25 missions planned in 2020: Isro chief", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["India", "India news", "India news today", "Today news", "Google news", "Breaking news", "isro sivan", "isro 2020", "Gaganyaan", "chandrayaan-3 cost", "Chandrayaan-3"], "tags": ["Indian Army", "Lok Sabha", "Shiv Sena", "Chandrayaan-3", "Congress", "Gaganyaan", "Asaduddin Owaisi", "BJP news", "Sachin Pilot", "YSRCP", "Supreme Court", "Mayawati", "ISRO news", "Jyotiraditya Scindia", "Omar Abdullah", "Rajnath Singh", "Donald Trump", "UIDAI"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "India News:  The space agency has already begun work on Chandrayaan-3, and Isro chairman K Sivan said it will cost Rs 250 cr (for lander, rover and propulsion mod", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "India News:  The space agency has already begun work on Chandrayaan-3, and Isro chairman K Sivan said it will cost Rs 250 cr (for lander, rover and propulsion mod", "keywords": "India, India news, India news today, Today news, Google news, Breaking news,isro sivan,isro 2020,Gaganyaan,chandrayaan-3 cost,Chandrayaan-3", "og": {"title": "Chandrayaan-3 to cost Rs 615 crore, launch could stretch to 2021 | India News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chandrayaan-3-to-cost-rs-615-crore-launch-could-stretch-to-2021/articleshow/73055941.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73055945,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-816184,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "India News:  The space agency has already begun work on Chandrayaan-3, and Isro chairman K Sivan said it will cost Rs 250 cr (for lander, rover and propulsion mod", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chandrayaan-3-to-cost-rs-615-crore-launch-could-stretch-to-2021/articleshow/73055941.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73055945,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-816184,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "Chandrayaan-3 to cost Rs 615 crore, launch could stretch to 2021 | India News - Times of India", "description": "India News:  The space agency has already begun work on Chandrayaan-3, and Isro chairman K Sivan said it will cost Rs 250 cr (for lander, rover and propulsion mod", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chandrayaan-3-to-cost-rs-615-crore-launch-could-stretch-to-2021/articleshow/73055941.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 26781952138, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0", "robots": "NOODP"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chandrayaan-3-to-cost-rs-615-crore-launch-could-stretch-to-2021/articleshow/73055941.cms"}
