(AP) \u2014 The Hershey Co. will soon retire its vehicles that are shaped like its Hershey\u2019s Kisses.\n\nThe Hershey Kissmobiles, which are each made up of three massive Kisses candies, have traveled across the country since 1997. The chocolate company has confirmed that the 26-foot-long vehicles won\u2019t return in 2020.\n\nThe company decided to pull the aging Kissmobiles out of safety concerns for employees and the public, Hershey Co. spokesman Jeff Beckman said. It has also become more difficult to find replacement parts for the custom vehicles.\n\nOne of the Kissmobiles will be available for public viewing at the AACA Museum in Hershey.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Hershey", "hershey kissmobile", "Hershey's"], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Associated Press", "Kevin Hayes", "Posted Jayne Ann Bugda"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 21:52:01 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Hershey Co. will soon retire its vehicles that are shaped like its Hershey's Kisses.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.pahomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2019/06/apple-touch-icon-ipad-retina.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Hershey Co. will soon retire its vehicles that are shaped like its Hershey's Kisses.", "keywords": "Hershey, hershey kissmobile, Hershey's", "google-site-verification": "FwZipa5OSBSoWw__8rA31Nc-YH2CXYuBMAuUd55lf-Q", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "fb": {"pages": 126168454064392}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kiss them goodbye: Hershey is retiring fleet of Kissmobiles", "url": "https://www.pahomepage.com/top-stories/kiss-them-goodbye-hershey-is-retiring-fleet-of-kissmobiles/", "description": "The Hershey Co. will soon retire its vehicles that are shaped like its Hershey\u2019s Kisses.", "site_name": "PAhomepage.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.pahomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/01/1120_Hershey_AP.jpg?w=1024&h=720&crop=1&resize=1280,720", "secure_url": "https://www.pahomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/01/1120_Hershey_AP.jpg?w=1024&h=720&crop=1&resize=1280,720"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T21:52:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T21:52:06+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Kiss them goodbye: Hershey is retiring fleet of Kissmobiles"}, "image": "https://www.pahomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/01/1120_Hershey_AP.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kiss them goodbye: Hershey is retiring fleet of Kissmobiles", "description": "The Hershey Co. will soon retire its vehicles that are shaped like its Hershey\u2019s Kisses."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.pahomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2019/06/apple-touch-icon-ipad-retina.png?w=152"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.pahomepage.com/top-stories/kiss-them-goodbye-hershey-is-retiring-fleet-of-kissmobiles/"}
