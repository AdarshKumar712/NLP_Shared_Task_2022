Trump added that the protesters should be put in jail for a long time to avoid these types of riots and insurrections from happening again.\n\nOn a teleconference call yesterday (June 1) with several governors from around the United States, President Trump issued a scathing warning that if the leaders do not \u201cdominate\u201d the protesters in the streets by matching force with force, then \u201cthey\u2019re going to run over you. You\u2019re going to look like a bunch of jerks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to arrest these people. You\u2019ve got arrest these people \u2014 and you\u2019ve got to charge them,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t do this deal where they get one week in jail. These are terrorists, these are terrorists, they\u2019re looking to do bad things to our country. They\u2019re Antifa and they\u2019re radical left. You have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you\u2019ll never see this stuff again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that if the rioting and looting could not be stopped by state and local law enforcement, he will have no problem sending in the U.S. military to all major cities that were not under control, including the country\u2019s capital.\n\nCities such as New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Richmond, and many others have been issued a mandatory curfew during night hours. Those who violate these orders are subject to arrest. Video footage of these overtly aggressive arrests has surfaced, such as the Spelman and Morehouse students who were tased after their car window was broken and tire flattened by the Atlanta Police before being arrested for violating curfew.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["national curfew", "u.s. military", "curfew", "U.S. President Donald Trump", "National Guard", "police brutality"], "authors": ["The Source Magazine Staff Writer"], "publish_date": "Tue Jun  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Trump added that the protesters should be put in jail for a long time to avoid these types of riots and insurrections from happening again.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bigS.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Trump added that the protesters should be put in jail for a long time to avoid these types of riots and insurrections from happening again.", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Trump Suggests Protesters Be Imprisoned for 10 Years", "description": "Trump added that the protesters should be put in jail for a long time to avoid these types of riots and insurrections from happening again.", "url": "https://thesource.com/2020/06/02/trump-suggests-that-protesters-be-imprisoned-for-10-years/", "site_name": "The Source", "image": {"identifier": "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10666884a.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 533}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheSourceMagazine/", "published_time": "2020-06-02T15:42:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-06-02T18:54:37+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TheSource", "site": "@TheSource", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Sha Be Allah", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.6.7", "follow.it-verification-code-N2RlWmIxTDArNTFCdWJBanpYY0c2Qy9qcXhteDhHUGJ1dEZpQW40bklYbkFHclRmZGtHWExqTytkaW9oS0kyV083VGRwMmFVaFVkSWN4TFhoRkR0RnVjckdWZjFURGJiTG5JSGo1ZHdNRDlkRFJUTUw2T0UvSzhiTnFTQm9uNS98c21LSWgzZFJmOW5NMWFBT0M4VTd6TzdJbGdOaXZKUDZEUmw4ME9tSEVBWT0=": "5pQzDeNkcKQNf35KxPz0", "follow.it-verification-code-VTcwa0tjWlEwcVRmZnlTK0I4cHo5TWdKaFR6SVFoNURoUnJYT2NEZi9Zd3dleUM0WVRUMVN5OGxpWVNpUFhhVHV2Q0REZkxzSEl6TkJBSlpPYXVDaUpkaWNLdjFZUUpyQTg5RlAyeTMrb1ZWS011dlFwVnRpVXY4Z0VkQTlWQ1V8Q0srTlkzVG5vOXQ3ek1YOVhaSmJUd3laZ090ZVhQQ1BDKzlKVXFKOXh3ST0=": "awf3YNPPHcM4FkjmxN7A", "follow.it-verification-code-dFl3ekhzRHBDMmdIQlluWlVTMVJzcFpKMXlQN2hVeHVGRUJ4TWdYei9Bb0FPYkh6eVd4cXVHSVRVSHpjZmZ4azJIcUxmVlgyRFI3dHZiNFA5aW1HQXBXRUNxSGx0cHFMS1NOc0l0OW50TXlRclUzYVZ4MlhBZ1h4U1ZqdHhaZnp8RExYeVdCWVNaemxER3k4QnE4SjZhN3lrMGV1WDFyYXdOT2QxcmZSQS92bz0=": "f3GwnwCFufrBtQDpRT6B", "follow.it-verification-code-Q2drNGtSSmR6TldCdlBIM2tCZzdadnVyRWpUSk44am9BbWJON0lkUytkQjQ0Ky8yY0daa3lHWk9xbmc1L3l2Y3Q5N1hlbTQraXpNZVZBSndySyt2cVFFTGM1UldhajdXT3RtMkwyMmM1d2pqOU1lR1dwVWJGcmxhUE1XanZ1YXh8elFKeEVvRkc5NTNMYU5EdnF1YmpRWEMvcWlRZk8vY1NudXpjWDhwVVFWUT0=": "lKMgtQ7zf6UaujMpkCKd", "follow.it-verification-code-Q1VDRGMycDhDSkJTcEhvRFpyeDNpOExreHpMSU9xZXZkdkVaTWk0c3dib1FuTm9OdEs0RGdxUk1pdlVySWZ4d2ZIbU0wQ05SNHJiUTN4Z1BZNVJYb3ltREh4YTVzKytac1RvZkhiVnlqKzJnSE1oUWxsMU5OZlFnT25lMGNrRG18ZWp5Q1FxcVE5Q1R4K0NuRmZ6cHFKUnQ3cGtQVjF1eDJ0SnJUQTRWd05Wbz0=": "LxUG8fQWPzJ0aYZwFdbg", "follow.it-verification-code-RVI3SXZzNVdhcVA2dHo0ajljOTc0SGNaaWxBTHk4YkVvKzVxOTFVMGw0MnNUM2F1dlR6Y3RMUm1ZV1ZBbWphSVFpTHZtcUhPL3g0cVdJbmdOMjI3VFZkT0R5WlFadmsyUTFWNmlyMTVna3FLU2RucGpkbXQ3aDcyeGZUekJNKzl8WGV3aFZWU2ZZK1V2cDlWTzdadnJzUHZhOUgvWjgwM0NHMWoyVEUzWVBWcz0=": "E5KZXDTbb9MFm9ynlgZ0", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bigS.ico", "google-site-verification": "rKGseO85_qm7vgUYuPMnI9lZKQsFN3UG-cWMMlPuAfA"}, "canonical_link": "https://thesource.com/2020/06/02/trump-suggests-that-protesters-be-imprisoned-for-10-years/"}
