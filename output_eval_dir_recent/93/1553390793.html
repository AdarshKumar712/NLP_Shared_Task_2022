                    <p>Mar. 19&#8211;Scroll through the gallery above to see images of the San Francisco Bay Area that&#8217;s under a shelter-in-place order to prevent COVID-19 spread.</p>
<p>March 19, 9:45 a.m. UC San Francisco announced Thursday it&#8217;s working to increase COVID-19 testing capacity in coming weeks.</p>
<p>Since March 9, UCSF Health has been testing about 60 to 100 inpatients a day with a test using &#8220;a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique&#8221; that&#8217;s similar to the one administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>&#8220;PCR allows scientists to detect very small amounts of virus in a sample obtained with a swab from a patient&#8217;s nose and throat,&#8221; UCSF said in a statement. &#8220;The technique depends on the availability of special substances known as reagents (&#8220;ree-AY-gents&#8221;), which are in very short supply nationwide, as are the swabs used to obtain patient samples. UCSF is making every effort to ensure we have a robust and reliable supply chain for all the materials we need to maintain and expand our testing capacity.&#8221;</p>
<p>UCSF is expanding its laboratory and as long as the medical center has access to testing reagents, it is on track to increase testing capacity to as many as 1,000 inpatients and symptomatic outpatients per day over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and CZ Biohub are helping support the effort.</p>
<p>March 19, 7:30 a.m. Three residents of the Atria Burlingame assisted living facility in San Mateo tested positive for COVID-19, according to ABC 7. The facility is now closed to visitors and the three residents are all hospitalized. KRON 4 reports that two additional residents are under hospital quarantine. San Mateo County Health Department and CDC are investigating the situation.</p>
<p>Atria Burlingame wasn&#8217;t immediately available for comment on this story.</p>
