UCSF is making every effort to ensure we have a robust and reliable supply chain for all the materials we need to maintain and expand our testing capacity.\u201d\n\nUCSF is expanding its laboratory and as long as the medical center has access to testing reagents, it is on track to increase testing capacity to as many as 1,000 inpatients and symptomatic outpatients per day over the next few weeks.\n\nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and CZ Biohub are helping support the effort.\n\nMarch 19, 7:30 a.m. Three residents of the Atria Burlingame assisted living facility in San Mateo tested positive for COVID-19, according to ABC 7.
