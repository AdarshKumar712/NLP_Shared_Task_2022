The English born and raised senior lecturer has now been in Port Macquarie over a year and said he loves what he does. \"When I was about 10 I witnessed a car crash and watching the paramedics work I knew that was what I wanted to do when I grew up,\" Sam said. \"The paramedics I saw that day instinctively knew what to do and I thought they had all the answers to help the people who were hurt and I knew then I wanted to do the same thing when I got older. \"It hasn't always been an easy path to get where I wanted to go but I believe with passion and determination then you can get there. \"When I started as a paramedic in England I never thought I would go on to teach at universities in two countries or be an author but that is my life.\" Mr Willis is a senior lecturer in paramedicine at Charles Sturt University based in Port macquarie, Mr Willis has a masters degree and is currently working towards a PhD in paramedicine, and said growing up his life wasn't easy but with a goal of where he wanted to end up his passion and drive got him there. \"I didn't get the marks at school to go and study what I wanted to right away so I had to go to college before going to university,\" he said. \"It wasn't easy and I had to make a lot of sacrifices but knowing what I wanted made it worth it. In the beginning I worked as an ambulance dispatcher and i didn't get into paramedicine the first time so it was challenging. \"I did question what I wanted and if it really was what I wanted but deep down I knew it was.\" As a lecturer Mr Willis said he does sympathise with students who are struggling and prides himself on trying to help them. \"When I was studying the course was challenging which did make it hard at times but I am a big believer in even if something is hard you should go for it.\" Mr Willis is the co-author and a contributor to a second edition of Fundamentals of Paramedic Practice, an accessible and comprehensive introduction to paramedic science and pre-hospital care, providing expert and up-to-date guidance on the essential theories and real-world practice of this dynamic area of emergency medicine. \"The book came about because there aren't a lot of new books coming about about paramedicine and I wanted to change that. \"The book has a large number of fantastic contributors who have ensured the book is relevant and up to date.\" The book is being launch at Charles Sturt University in Port Macquarie on March 10.
