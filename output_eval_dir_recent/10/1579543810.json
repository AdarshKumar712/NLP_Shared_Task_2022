However, in spite of that WHO recently let it be known that they make no such recommendation.\n\nQ: Could #ibuprofen worsen disease for people with #COVID19? A: Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend against the use of of ibuprofen. pic.twitter.com/n39DFt2amF \u2014 World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) March 18, 2020\n\nMany reports came out warning against the use of the product after WHO spokesman Christian Lindminder advised agaisnt its use in a press conference. But seems that media outlets jumped on this \u201cNews\u201d too soon, as the WHO has said that they do not recommend against the use of Ibuprofen.\n\nWHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier, according to Yahoo News, said during a Geneva press conference that while there are no recent studies that link the anti-inflammatory drug with \u2018increased mortality rates\u2019 we should still in the meantime use paracetamol instead of ibuprofen. This coming also around the same time France\u2019s health minister saying people should not use NSAIDs if they are having coronavirus-like symptoms as it could make their condition worse. Oliver Veran on Twitter said; \u201cTaking anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, cortisone\u2026) could be an aggravating factor for the infection. If you have a fever, take paracetamol.\u201d\n\nWHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters in Geneva the UN health agency\u2019s experts were \u201clooking into this to give further guidance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, we recommend using rather paracetamol, and do not use ibuprofen as a self-medication. That\u2019s important,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also mentioned that if ibuprofen had been \u201cprescribed by the healthcare professionals, then, of course, that is up to them.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, not much else is known in regards but many are quite confused about the warnings. It\u2019s important to know that there has been no proper research into ibuprofen and the novel coronavirus itself aside from a study published in the Lancet just last week.\n\nBBC wrote as follows on the topic:\n\nSome experts believe that ibuprofen\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties may \u201cdampen\u201d the body\u2019s immune response.\n\nProf Parastou Donyai at the University of Reading says: \u201cThere are many studies that suggest ibuprofen use during a respiratory infection can result in worsening of the disease or other complications.\u201d\n\nBut, she says, \u201cI have not seen any scientific evidence that clearly shows a totally healthy 25-year-old taking ibuprofen for symptoms of COVID-19 is putting themselves at additional risk of complications.\u201d\n\nWorries over the use of ibuprofen appear to have surfaced in France, after Jean-Louis Montastruc, a doctor at Toulouse University Hospital warned on Twitter that: \u201cIn this period of coronavirus, it is necessary to remember the risk of complications of the NSAIDs in case of fever or infection.\u201d\n\nA subsequent tweet by France\u2019s health minister, Olivier Veran, saying that anti-inflammatory drugs \u201ccould be an aggravating factor of the infection\u201d was shared more than 43,000 times. But he also said people should consult a doctor before stopping taking them.\n\nOther tweets are also being shared including one saying that ibuprofen \u201cmay cause severe cases of the disease, even in young and middle-aged adults with no underlying conditions\u201d which has been shared more than 94,000 times on Twitter.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Gerald Sinclair"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://awarenessact.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo-aa-fb-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "og": {"site_name": "Awareness Act", "url": "https://awarenessact.com/who-doesnt-recommend-against-the-use-of-ibuprofen/", "title": "WHO Doesn\u2019t Recommend Against The Use Of Ibuprofen For COVID-19 Symptoms", "type": "article", "image": "https://awarenessact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/shutterstock_1676472499.jpg"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://awarenessact.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo-aa-fb-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://awarenessact.com/who-doesnt-recommend-against-the-use-of-ibuprofen/"}
