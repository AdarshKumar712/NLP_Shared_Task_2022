I believe if we all adhere to the SOP and discipline ourselves, action will not be taken by the authorities against us,\u201d he said in his daily press conference here.\n\nStates that recorded the highest number of attempts to cross state borders were Selangor (284), Kedah (122) and Melaka (113).\n\nIsmail Sabri said police arrested 136 individuals yesterday, with 75 remanded and 61 released under bail for flouting CMCO rules.\n\n\u201cThe police also issued compounds to 534 individuals for committing various CMCO offences, of which 25 out of 266 compounds issued at police stations were for Aidilfitri house visitation,\u201d he said, adding that 257 compounds were issued at manned roadblocks.\n\nResponding to a question on individuals needing to return to major cities to attend job interviews, Ismail Sabri advised companies conducting said interviews to hold them online instead, with interstate travel still prohibited throughout the CMCO.\n\nAsked to respond to several reports of individuals being arrested and issued compounds for fishing during the CMCO, Ismail Sabri reiterated that fishing activities in large groups are still prohibited under the CMCO, with recreational activities involving crowds disallowed.\n\n\u201cI have said before that fishing in ponds is not allowed because if compared to lakes, the size differs and it may be difficult for individuals to maintain distance with each other.\n\n\u201cTherefore I believe the arrests were made because the said individuals had gathered in a large group to fish. If only one goes fishing, I believe there will be no arrests whatsoever,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles Public must obtain CAAM clearance to fly drones during CMCO, says senior minister 533 new Covid-19 cases in Singapore, tally stands at 32,876 S.
