Ma\u0142gorzata Kidawa-B\u0142o\u0144ska (PO), who is closest in the polls behind the incumbent Andrzej Duda, promised to undo many PiS reforms, and restore the rule of law and be \u201ca true president\u201d, because \u201cit is time for Poland to have a female president\u201d.\n\nAmong her proposals, she listed a tax-free pension, more money for healthcare (1% of GDP more than it is now) and retaining a popular social benefits 500+ programme. Her convention featured a few prominent people hurt by the ruling party, but also youth from the Climate Strike.\n\nAnother contender, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz (PSL) held a convention in Rzesz\u00f3w, a PiS stronghold, and positioned himself as a candidate \u201cwho brings hope for Poland\u201d and is the only viable alternative to Duda. Presenting himself as a moderate, Kosiniak-Kamysz presented the vision of active presidency, focused on abiding by the constitution, bringing Poland back to the main European table and healing the healthcare system in Poland. Also, his wife made an appearance and presented some social and healthcare initiatives she intends to take up.\n\nRobert Biedro\u0144, candidate of the Left, also held a rally on Sunday and promised to end coal dependency by 2035, to introduce a programme of 1 million apartments for rent and advocated the right to terminate pregnancy until the 12th week.\n\nAccording to the latest polls, Duda holds a steady advantage over Kidawa B\u0142o\u0144ska (about 45% to about 25%). Kosiniak-Kamysz and Biedro\u0144 vie for third place (10%), while Szymon Ho\u0142ownia, TV personality, is still in single digits as is the candidate of far-right Konfederacja, Krzysztof Bosak (\u0141ukasz Gadza\u0142a | EURACTIV.pl)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Mar  2 08:28:58 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/themes/euractiv_com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "wp-parsely_version": "2.0", "robots": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot-news": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "WARSAW - Opposition rallies"}, "og": {"title": "WARSAW - Opposition rallies", "url": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/warsaw-opposition-rallies/", "type": "article", "site_name": "www.euractiv.com", "image": {"alt": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/warsaw-opposition-rallies/"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-02 08:28:58", "author": "\u0141ukasz Gadza\u0142a"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/ea_favicon_16x16.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/warsaw-opposition-rallies/"}
