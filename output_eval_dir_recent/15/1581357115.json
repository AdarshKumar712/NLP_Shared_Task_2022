(efe-epa).- Spanish health authorities registered a jump in the number of daily coronavirus fatalities on Friday but a change in the way regional data was collected led to confusion over the figures.\n\nFernando Sim\u00f3n, head of Spain\u2019s emergency public health department, said 585 people had died in the last 24 hours, up from the 551 the previous day.\n\nThe figure brought the overall death toll to 19,478 with a fatality rate of 10.5 per cent.\n\nBut the number does not match the difference in the overall death toll reported by the health ministry between Thursday and Friday.\n\nSim\u00f3n said the government was in the process of trying to iron out regional discrepancies in coronavirus information.\n\nThe health ministry later said the discrepancy had resulted from conflicting figures arriving from Catalonia.\n\nHealth minister Salvador Illa told a press conference: \u201cWith regards to the data, there was an incident with the information in Catalonia.\n\n\u201cWe have received data both from a healthcare level and a public administration on, we\u2019ve decided to go for the more rigorous source.\u201d\n\nSim\u00f3n said the figures will be prone to fluctuations in the coming days due to the changes.\n\nThe health ministry has asked each of Spain\u2019s 17 regions to report back on the same criteria every day.\n\nFrom Friday, they will be expected to provide data not just on the number of new infections, deaths, hospitalisations and hospital discharges but also the number of tests, including rapid-tests and antibody tests, they have carried out.\n\nThey must also state how many of the new infections were asymptomatic carriers.\n\nThe health ministry said 5,252 people had tested positive for Covid-19 between Thursday and Friday, bringing the overall tally in Spain, one of the world\u2019s worst-hit countries, to 188,069.\n\nSim\u00f3n warned that the number of infections would likely increase as Spain tries to boost the number of daily tests.\n\nRegional health authorities will also be expected to provide data on anyone who died after taking a test, whether in a clinical setting or at home.\n\nIlla said the changes were necessary to confirm when the country\u2019s pandemic begins to decrease.\n\nEmployment minister Yolanda D\u00edaz said the government would look to resume work life in the country in two stages, first with productive sectors by the summer with an eye to kick-starting other sectors like tourism by the end of the year.\n\nSpain\u2019s economy, which went through a two-week period of \u201chibernation\u201d at the beginning of April, is set to enter a recession once the health crisis is over, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has begun talks with other political leaders in search of a national pact to plot the country\u2019s roadmap out of the crisis.
