Many organisers have simply cancelled conferences. Some are resorting to the fallback option of distance conferencing and interpretation technologies to nonetheless manage to conduct their meetings. Although this scenario is far from ideal for conference interpreters, we understand that in many cases it may constitute the only option left for colleagues to make ends meet in these difficult times.\n\nIn the interest of the profession and our collective and individual professional reputations, however, we would urge colleagues to insist on compliance with the basic standards for such interpreting scenarios as set out in AIIC\u2019s guidelines on distance interpreting as well as with ISO 20108 on 'Simultaneous interpreting- Quality and transmission of sound and video input' and ISO PAS 24019 on cloud-based platforms. Ensuring such compliance will benefit our clients, the participants and ourselves, the interpreters.\n\nShould you have any doubts regarding any of the above, please do not hesitate to reach out to AIIC's Task Force on Distance Interpreting for guidance and support at the following address: taskforce-distance-interpreting@gv1ggzr.aiic.net\n\nWishing you all the best of health!\n\nKind regards,\n\nExCo", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["environment", "technical-standards", "covid-19", "distance-interpreting", "coronavirus", "proffessional-advice", "health", "professional-advice", "executive-committee"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Feb 28 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "//d36nacs91rtkgb.cloudfront.net/static/images/chrome.png", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-snippet:150, max-image-preview:standard", "theme-color": "#029bc4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "twitter": {"site": "@aiiconline", "title": "Impact of Coronavirus on conference interpreters", "description": "Statement by the AIIC Executive Committee", "image": {"src": "//dwe2wjn6madce.cloudfront.net/~inpage/8940/AIIC%20Executive%20Committee%20Logo%20Primary%20Vert%20Pos%20sm.jpg?v=20200228151511"}}, "og": {"title": "Impact of Coronavirus on conference interpreters", "type": "article", "url": "//aiic.net/page/8940", "image": "//dwe2wjn6madce.cloudfront.net/~inpage/8940/AIIC%20Executive%20Committee%20Logo%20Primary%20Vert%20Pos%20sm.jpg?v=20200228151511", "description": "Statement by the AIIC Executive Committee", "site_name": "aiic.net"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-28", "section": "Interpreting News", "tag": "technical-standards"}, "AIIC.content_id": 8940, "AIIC.context_id": 100, "AIIC.master_node_id": 22, "AIIC.workflow_id": 5, "AIIC.workflow_set_by": 208432, "AIIC.workflow_set_on": "2020-02-28 16:18:23.794", "AIIC.created_by": 208432, "AIIC.updated_by": 208432}, "canonical_link": "//aiic.net/page/8940/impact-of-coronavirus-on-conference-interpreters/lang/1"}
