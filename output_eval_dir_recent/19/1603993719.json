Occupational safety and health of nurses- this includes access to protective equipment to ensure their health.\n\n2. Mental health support- nurses are working round the clock during the COVID-19 pandemic hampering their mental health. WHO encourages countries to provide help to nurses with timely pay, sick leave, insurance and mental support.\n\n3. Financial support to nurses and providing them essential resources which can help them respond to and control COVID-19 and future outbreaks.\n\nThe theme for International Nurses Day 2020 is 'Nursing the World to Health'\n\nPhoto Credit: iStock\n\nRole of nurses in COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThis year on International Nurses Day, International Council of Nursing, WHO and Nursing Now are encouraging people to pay tribute to nurses and health workers who tragically died fighting against the coronavirus by promoting #RememerHealthHeros on social media.\n\nAlso read: Top 10 Tips For A Healthy Life\n\nHappy International Nurses Day to all the nurses and thank you for your non-stop assistance during this pandemic.\n\nAlso read: World Health Day 2020 Honours Nurses And Midwives: Here's Everything You Need To Know\n\nDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.
