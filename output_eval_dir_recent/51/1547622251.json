Set at the end of the 24th century, the show follows Captain Jean-Luc Picard (reprised by Sir Patrick Stewart), a retired captain of the USS Enterprise who is setting off on his newest adventure.\n\nThe series is set 18 years after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation which first aired in 1987. This was the second series of the franchise, and was widely considered the best. Most importantly to me, it was my grandparents\u2019 favourite.\n\nGrowing up, they watched me after school while my mom was away studying at the University of Toronto. She raised me with their help.\n\nOn weekdays starting from when I was 10, my grandfather took over the television at exactly 5 p.m., turning off my cartoons so we could watch Star Trek. I was immediately hooked. I loved the premise: the human race had finally settled into world peace, and now spent all their resources learning about the universe.\n\nThe Star Trek franchise has been a constant on big and small screens for over fifty years, with Picard as the latest iteration airing only a year after another new series, Star Trek: Discovery.\n\nCaptain Picard graced television screens for seven seasons and four films back in the 1980s and 1990s. These TV shows and films presented a future where poverty and inequality had been abolished. They intertwined themes of diversity and allegories of social justice into philosophical debates about science, morality, consciousness, and war.\n\nAt times, Star Trek was also a silly show where people ran around shooting low-budget aliens with lasers in front of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sets.\n\nThough production value has improved over the years, Picard is still tinged with nostalgia\u2014and even loss\u2014thanks to the ongoing plotlines that connect all of the franchise\u2019s iterations together. In the last film, Picard\u2019s dear friend, an android named Commander Data, died. In the new series, Data\u2019s death continues to haunt the captain decades later.\n\nStar Trek also reflects feelings of nostalgia and loss in my personal life. My grandpa died suddenly within months of Leonard Nimoy, who was best known for playing the beloved character of Spock in the original Star Trek. While I didn\u2019t know Nimoy personally, his loss was compounded by that of my grandfather. When the world mourned his loss, I imagined some of their mourning was also for my grandfather, who loved Star Trek so much.\n\nWhile the new series has rightfully honoured Star Trek\u2019s past, it\u2019s also transformed and reinvented itself to adapt to the changing times.\n\nPicard brings us into a gritty, complicated world well-suited for 2020. The utopia of Gene Roddenberry\u2019s original Star Trek would probably not sit as well with current audiences as the divisive world that Picard presents us with.\n\nWith mounting distrust in real-life institutions and governments, it can be hard for modern viewers to imagine a utopic future for humanity.\n\nStar Trek posits that eventually, humanity will band together with like-minded aliens and form a peaceful governmental body called the United Federation of Planets. The military branch, called Starfleet, is charged with scientific exploration, diplomacy and defence.\n\nPicard tells us that the government of the future can also be corrupt.\n\nIn Picard, Earth has banned human-like robots with artificial intelligences\u2014known as synthetics\u2014because of a terrorist attack on a colony on Mars perpetrated by a rogue group of them.\n\nThis is an allegory for a government banning a marginalized race because of the actions of a few extremists, which is a familiar approach that Star Trek takes in addressing topical world issues of the present.\n\nInstead of problems existing on far-away planets as is customary for Star Trek, Picard brings the problems closer to home\u2014namely, our own solar system\u2014with the first episode taking place primarily on earth.\n\nPicard meets Dahj (Isa Briones), a woman who learns that she is an android despite having grown up believing she was human. They discover that her father may be none other than the late Data, who was one of Picard\u2019s closest friends and colleagues, who was an android himself.\n\nWith a sweeping ban on synthetic life, androids like Dahj and her sister Soji (also Isa Briones) are in life-threatening danger. Instead of being the captain of Starfleet\u2019s flagship, the Enterprise, the retired Captain Picard is forced to embark on his mission in secret.\n\nWhile, for me, it\u2019s startling to see cracks form in the utopia that I grew up knowing in the show, growing disillusionment with an organization like Starfleet seems like a natural progression.\n\nIn my eyes, this plot sets the show up for success. Despite taking a new turn, Picard is able to begin anew while also maintaining a strong tether to its source material by referencing key events from the end of Star Trek: The Next Generation and recent blockbuster films.\n\nBringing Captain Picard back is a bold move. He\u2019s one of the most beloved characters of the entire Star Trek franchise, with an immense legacy to live up to.\n\nOver Reading Week, I sat on the same couch I used to sit on after school and watched Star Trek with my grandmother. My grandfather probably would have refused to watch the new series, preferring to watch the old one instead. I like to think that we would have convinced him to see it eventually.\n\nI\u2019m excited to see exactly where Picard will boldly go next. With stunning reprisals of iconic roles alongside compelling new characters, combined with a strong plot, this show has a bright future.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Star Trek\u2019s new series reminds me why I\u2019m a fan of the franchise", "The Journal"], "tags": ["TV review", "Sentimental"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Mar 12 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The day that the new Star Trek series premiered, my grandma called to remind me that it was on at 8 p.m. She didn\u2019t want me to forget and miss it\u2014especially given the franchise\u2019s significance to my family.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.queensjournal.ca/sites/default/themes/queensjournal/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The day that the new Star Trek series premiered, my grandma called to remind me that it was on at 8 p.m. She didn\u2019t want me to forget and miss it\u2014especially given the franchise\u2019s significance to my family.", "keywords": "Star Trek\u2019s new series reminds me why I\u2019m a fan of the franchise , The Journal", "generator": "Drupal 7 (https://www.drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The Journal", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2020-03-12/pop-culture/star-treks-new-series-reminds-me-why-im-a-fan-of-the-franchise/", "title": "Star Trek\u2019s new series reminds me why I\u2019m a fan of the franchise", "image": "https://www.queensjournal.ca/sites/default/files/img/story/2020/03/12/lifestyle_-_picard_web.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "url": "https://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2020-03-12/pop-culture/star-treks-new-series-reminds-me-why-im-a-fan-of-the-franchise/", "title": "Star Trek\u2019s new series reminds me why I\u2019m a fan of the franchise", "image": "https://www.queensjournal.ca/sites/default/files/img/story/2020/03/12/lifestyle_-_picard_web.png"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2020-03-12/pop-culture/star-treks-new-series-reminds-me-why-im-a-fan-of-the-franchise/"}
