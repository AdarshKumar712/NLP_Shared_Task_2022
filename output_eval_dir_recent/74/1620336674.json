They will also be working to get contract tracers online and distribute further PPE and masks.\n\nThe MTA will also be preparing subways and buses over the next week to increase scheduled service, Cuomo added.\n\nThe reopening is not a return to the pre-COVID-19 world, but a new normal in which more than 400,000 workers at the start will be returning to duty with various health precautions in place.\n\n\u201cRemember that reopening does not mean we\u2019re going back to the way things work. It\u2019s going to be different,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt\u2019s reopening to a new safer normal. People will be wearing masks and socially distanced. It\u2019s just a new way of interacting, which is what we have to do.\u201d\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio, who joined Cuomo for the announcement via video, said both the city and state were confident by the progress made to pinpoint a tentative reopening date.\n\n\u201cWhen I talked to the people of the city this morning, I told them the indicators were absolutely moving in the right direction,\u201d de Blasio said, \u201cbut the key to getting to the point of definition for Phase 1 came from the collaboration to get on the same page and make sure we were confident that this was the right time to do it.\u201d\n\nUnder Phase 1, construction and light manufacturing will be permitted to resume. Retailers will also be able to open to customers for curbside delivery. All workers and customers will be required to wear a mask and practice social distancing.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri May 29 17:35:57 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "New York City, the last closed region of New York state during the COVID-19 pandemic, finally has a projected reopening date.
