Now the studio version is out and, of course, it's made NPR Music's best songs of the month, along with new tracks from Thundercat, Waxahatchee and Marcus King.\n\nBelow you'll find an alphabetized list of NPR Music's top 20 songs of January 2020. Be sure to check out our top 10 albums from the month as well.\n\nCable Ties, \"Sandcastles\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nMission-driven Australian trio stages a hypothetical argument with self-righteous naysayers by first listening to complaints (\"I partly agree\"), then by locating a message worth repeating until it builds to a roar. \u2014 Jacob Ganz\n\nDan Deacon, \"Become a Mountain\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nDan Deacon shows an unusually vulnerable side of himself and expresses that with a more stripped-down sound. \"I was feeling emotionally very raw,\" Dan says, \"and I wanted the music I was writing to reflect that.\" \u2014 Bob Boilen\n\nFACS, \"Teenage Hive\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nIf FACS' first record was a bold step through the door, and its second a pensive, deep breath, then the third is shaping up to be the spittle-scream that followed. Chaos in a bottle. \u2014 Andrew Flanagan\n\nForest Drive West, \"Parallel Space\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nA full-time dad and computer science teacher, the artist behind Forest Drive West blends old-school breakbeat with the spirit of Aphex Twin ambience for a new, never ending groove. \u2014 Tom Huizenga\n\nHayley Williams, \"Simmer\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nParamore's powerhouse singer sheds her skin for something darker and stranger; her dynamism bleeds through an ominous cloud. \u2014 Lars Gotrich\n\nKasa Overall, \"Show Me a Prison\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nListening to the powerful tribal-like trance pulsating through this meditation on injustice in the U.S. prison system feels like being on lock down, until activist Angela Davis, at the end, offers a ray of hope. \u2014 Suraya Mohamed\n\nMarcus King, \"Beautiful Stranger\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nSouth Carolina's 23-year-old guitar slinger reveals himself as a love man who truly understands Al Green's legacy on this worthy throwback to the soul greats. \u2014 Ann Powers\n\nOded Tzur, \"Here Be Dragons\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nThis, the title and opening track of Tzur's upcoming debut for the highly regarded label ECM, is a beautiful (and lovingly recorded) introduction to the Israeli saxophonist's curious whispers. \u2014 Andrew Flanagan\n\nPhony Ppl, \"Fkn Around (feat. Megan Thee Stallion)\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nWhile you decorate your desk with Megan's mantras for independence, beware: the secret sauce of this infectious single \u2014 that bubbling bass and Elbee Thrie's smooth hook \u2014 will seep into your brain. \u2014 Cyrena Touros\n\nRafiq Bhatia, \"The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face (feat. C\u00e9cile McLorin Salvant)\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nFrom his fascinating project reinventing jazz standards, this duet shows how one of the most sublime pop hits ever was always a call to prayer. \u2014 Ann Powers\n\nRosal\u00eda, \"Juro Que\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nThe global pop star was in festival mode last year, leaning into beats and collabs. \"Juro Que\" re-centers the flamenco at the heart of Rosal\u00eda's music. \u2014 Cyrena Touros\n\nSoccer Mommy, \"Circle the Drain\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nHumans have been writing about hearts for ages: breaking, aching, eclipsing, soaring. Soccer Mommy coins a new one on this dreamy, bummer-rock romp. \u2014 Cyrena Touros\n\nThundercat, \"Black Qualls (feat. Steve Lacy & Steve Arrington)\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nSomewhere deep in a P-Funk wormhole, our cat-obsessed bass guru got very worried about his Instagram and wrote this brilliant bounce of a tune. \u2014 Mano Sundaresan\n\nT\u00f5nu K\u00f5rvits, \"Tears-Fantasy\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nA supremely lyrical sensualist, Estonian composer T\u00f5nu K\u00f5rvits makes the orchestra sing in wistful sighs and luminous, falling figures while channeling England's Renaissance lutenist John Dowland. \u2014 Tom Huizenga\n\nToo Free, \"ATM\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nArthur Russell-inspired, avant-disco realness hits the ballroom floor in a minimalist bop that both flirts with that cutie across the dance floor and elevates visibility, \"to be seen by you.\" \u2014 Lars Gotrich\n\nTorres, \"Good Grief\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nIn the middle of Torres' heady album about fear and desire comes this blistering avowal of the right to sullenness (which also serves as a reminder of Mackenzie Scott's forceful skill as a guitarist). \u2014 Marissa Lorusso\n\nUltra\u00edsta, \"Tin King\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nNigel Godrich and Joey Waronker work up a hypnotic groove here, but singer Laura Bettinson remains Ultra\u00edsta's secret weapon, cramming tons of personality into a deadpan, texture-first performance with just a few notes. \u2014 Daoud Tyler-Ameen\n\nWaxahatchee, \"Fire\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nWritten on a drive over the Mississippi River, the first single from Waxahatchee's forthcoming Saint Cloud pulses with palpable warmth and radiates self-acceptance. \u2014 Marissa Lorusso\n\nWilma Archer, \"Last Sniff (feat. MF Doom)\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nArcher wraps a classic turn from MF Doom in a joyful, funky, rich, orchestral soul. And this is just one of the standouts from his brilliant upcoming album, A Western Circular. \u2014 Andrew Flanagan\n\nYoshinori Hayashi, \"Bit of Garden (Prins Thomas Remix)\" \u266c APPLE / SPOTIFY\n\nOne of Japan's most exciting auteurs of dance, reinterpreted by one of Norway's. Both play in the disco sandbox, and here Thomas helps Hayashi's somewhat sleepy original become a montage-worthy driver. \u2014 Andrew Flanagan\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Community Voices", "Jobs", "Local Service and Content Report", "RIS", "Donate", "Community Advisory Board", "To The Front", "Illinois Issues Survey"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Stream this playlist via Spotify or Apple Music.
