It was just a fight, three coloured guys and one black guy. They fought and dispersed, went to Liquid Blue and the other clubs. The fight happened here. These guys came back here and shot randomly. They shot anyone and anybody that didn\u2019t know a thing,\u201d describes the eyewitness.\n\n\u2018Negative impact on business\u2019\n\nA business owner in Melville, Johannesburg has expressed shock over the shooting incident. Walter Niemand owns a Bed and Breakfast with his wife, not far from where the shooting took place.\n\nHe says he fears that the incident will have a negative impact on their business and it may also affect international tourism.\n\n\u201cWe are all affected and it\u2019s not just us as business people but it\u2019s also for Melville, Johannesburg and the country. At the moment, we have guests from Holland, obviously, it won\u2019t make a good impression and they will tell their family and friends in Holland what they had experienced here,\u201d explains Niemand.\n\n\u2018Residents terrified\u2019\n\nResidents of Melville say crime in their area has gotten out of hand and they are terrified. Some residents describe how they are feeling following the shooting.\n\n\u201cObviously we are shocked at what goes on around here. Melville is a really vibey area and it\u2019s full of these beautiful and fun restaurants. Why do people want to come with aggression and just grab guns and shoot others? This is what happens in Melville, certain places operate as restaurants and they do not have entertainment licenses but they have loud music and DJs up to 3 in the morning. I never imagined there would be killings and injuries down the road from where I live,\u201d residents say.\n\nWatch related video below:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Walter Niemand", "Gauteng", "Melville", "Johannesburg"], "authors": ["Chuma Nobanda"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 14:12:51 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/wp-content/themes/sabcnews/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "gCibvUv7H6HwT4yzAs_7HJwWERwfBU1EH03cm4xodpk", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Melville drive-by shooting leaves residents in fear - SABC News - Breaking news, special reports, world, business, sport coverage of all South African current events.
