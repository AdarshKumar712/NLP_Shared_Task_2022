The money is not destined for the Tokyo organizers and the Japanese governments, which are preparing the games.\n\nIOC President Thomas Bach mentioned the contribution in a Sunday interview with a German newspaper but was not specific about the recipients of the aid.\n\n\"We will not stand by and see our international federations collapse,\" Coates said.\n\nJapan's obligation to absorb the added costs is stipulated in the \"Host City Contract\" signed in 2013 when the IOC awarded Tokyo the games. Neither the IOC nor Japanese officials are offering cost estimates, but media reports in Japan suggest an added bill of $2 billion to $6 billion on top of current spending.\n\nJapan says officially it is spending $12.6 billion, but a national audit says the figure is twice that much. Whatever the total, all but $5.6 billion is public money.\n\nThe IOC was expected to pay out about $600 million to federations this year, proceeds from the Tokyo Olympics. Some federations rely almost exclusively on IOC contributions.\n\nA reporter for Japanese broadcaster NHK asked organizing committee president Yoshiro Mori if the IOC \"should pitch in on costs\" to help Tokyo.\n\n\"We are in the midst of studying and reviewing the additional costs,\" Mori said. \"Of course, we know that we will have to pay what we have to pay. However, the general direction is reducing the costs to the extent possible.\"\n\nTokyo CEO Toshiro Muto promised to take a fresh look \"at the level of services we provide.\"\n\n\"Of course we will respond to the requests from federations and the national Olympic committees,\" Muto added. \"If we fully responded to all the requests coming from those entities the costs would be exorbitant.\"\n\nCoates was asked to explain how Japan will be in shape to host the Olympics in 15 months. Muto also expressed his concern last week.\n\nTokyo's coronavirus cases have been spiking and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called for emergency measures, asking people to stay home.\n\nThe games host 11,000 Olympic and 4,400 Paralympic athletes and staff from 206 national Olympic committees. They also rely on extensive global travel, and will need a go-ahead for mass gatherings \u2014 75,000 in Tokyo's new national stadium or 10,000 to 15,000 in many arenas.\n\n\"We've given ourselves as much time as possible,\" Coates said, pointing out that some wanted to reschedule for the spring of 2021. \"That was a factor to go as late as possible.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Times Colonist", "Victoria", "BC", "local news"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Stephen Wade"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Tokyo Olympic organizers and the IOC said Thursday they will cut some of the extras out of next year\u2019s postponed games, an attempt to limit what is expected to be billions of dollars in added . . .", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/gmg/img/apple/vtc_touch-icon-iphone.png", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "NOODP", "description": "Tokyo Olympic organizers and the IOC said Thursday they will cut some of the extras out of next year\u2019s postponed games, an attempt to limit what is expected to be billions of dollars in added . . .", "keywords": "Sports governance, Summer Olympic games, Corona, General news, Olympic games, Government and politics, 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, Sports, sport", "news_keywords": "Sports governance, Summer Olympic games, Corona, General news, Olympic games, Government and politics, 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, Sports, sport", "title": "Tokyo Olympics could cut 'extras' in face of soaring costs | Times Colonist", "DC.title": "Tokyo Olympics could cut 'extras' in face of soaring costs", "author": "Stephen Wade", "DC.creator": "Stephen Wade", "DC.subject": "Sports governance, Summer Olympic games, Corona, General news, Olympic games, Government and politics, 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, Sports, sport", "section": "Sports", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Times Colonist", "url": "https://www.timescolonist.com/tokyo-olympics-could-cut-extras-in-face-of-soaring-costs-1.24118815", "title": "Tokyo Olympics could cut 'extras' in face of soaring costs", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.24118816.1587046070!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/facebookogimage_560_292/tksj201-416-2020-110205-jpg.jpg", "width": 560, "height": 292}, "description": "Tokyo Olympic organizers and the IOC said Thursday they will cut some of the extras out of next year\u2019s postponed games, an attempt to limit what is expected to be billions of dollars in added . . ."}, "fb": {"app_id": 589634334411994}, "article": {"section": "Sports", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/timescolonist"}, "twitter": {"site": "@timescolonist", "title": "Tokyo Olympics could cut 'extras' in face of soaring costs", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.24118816.1587046070!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/facebookogimage_560_292/tksj201-416-2020-110205-jpg.jpg", "description": "Tokyo Olympic organizers and the IOC said Thursday they will cut some of the extras out of next year\u2019s postponed games, an attempt to limit what is expected to be billions of dollars in added . . ."}, "msvalidate.01": "B35552358D0685310DF5A3DE206352FA"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.timescolonist.com/tokyo-olympics-could-cut-extras-in-face-of-soaring-costs-1.24118815"}
