Maintaining Democratic numbers in the Legislature, he said, \"keeps my veto in place\" as both GOP-led chambers currently lack enough members to override Evers' actions \u2014 something he said is especially important because of the approaching census and redistricting round.\n\nAs for the presidential election, he stressed the need to get candidates to the state \"and have the people in Wisconsin understand the issues that each of them care about and we get a good turnout in the primary, good turnout next fall.\"\n\nShare your opinion on this topic by sending a letter to the editor to tctvoice@madison.com.
