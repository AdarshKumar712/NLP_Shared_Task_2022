This marks the first time the app has made the jump from iPad to Apple\u2019s desktop platform.\n\nThe app is based on its iPad counterpart and is built using Catalyst. That doesn\u2019t mean that users should expect the app to look and feel like a straight port, though. Apple says that there is plenty in there to make sure this is a real Mac app.\n\nSwift Playgrounds for Mac is a truly native macOS app with great performance, built using the powerful Mac Catalyst technology in macOS Catalina. This brings many of the same features users love from Swift Playgrounds on iPad, to the Mac. In addition, the Mac app adds unique features and user experiences that take advantage of diverse screen sizes and physical keyboard.\n\nThe app itself offers the same proposition as the Mac version. People won\u2019t need any coding knowledge in order to try working with Swift Playgrounds, with the app walking them through some simple tasks and guides as they learn.\n\nSwift Playgrounds is a revolutionary app for Mac and iPad that makes it fun to learn and experiment with code. You solve interactive puzzles in the guided \u201cLearn to Code\u201d lessons to master the basics of coding, or experiment with a wide range of challenges that let you explore many unique coding experiences. Swift Playgrounds requires no coding knowledge, so it\u2019s perfect for students just starting out, from twelve to one-hundred-and-twelve. The whole time you are learning Swift, a powerful programming language created by Apple and used by professionals to build many of today\u2019s most popular apps. Code you write works seamlessly as you move between Mac and iPad.\n\nSwift Playgrounds has been hugely popular on the iPad and people have been using it to learn how to code, just as Apple had intended. The arrival of a Mac version opens up additional possibilities for those wanting to learn. Not least for those who simply don\u2019t have an iPad to install Swift Playgrounds onto.\n\nYou can download Swift Playgrounds now, for free, from the Mac App Store. You\u2019ll need macOS Catalina 10.15.3 to run it.\n\n(Download: Swift Playgrounds for Mac on the App Store)\n\nYou may also like to check out:\n\nYou can follow us on Twitter, or Instagram, and even like our Facebook page to keep yourself updated on all the latest from Microsoft, Google, Apple, and the Web.\n\nRelated Stories", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["mac", "mac apps", "swift playgrounds"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Oliver Haslam", "Paul Morris", "Rp Staff"], "publish_date": "Wed Feb 12 19:15:53 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Apple has today released Swift Playgrounds for the Mac.
