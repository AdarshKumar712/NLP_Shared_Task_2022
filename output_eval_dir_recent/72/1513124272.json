The Samsung Galaxy S20 series has gone through a name change, it has also received a redesigned camera array and more, but now we have confirmation of this information directly from one of Samsung\u2019s websites.\n\nSamsung\u2019s German site posted images of the Samsung Galaxy S20, well inside a cover. The guys found these images over at WinFuture before they were taken down. With this, we may have some sort of confirmation of the name and the design of the Galaxy S20 series. We see the same design we have seen in previous leaks, even though we don\u2019t get a full view of the devices back panel. However, the new camera module with a triple camera setup is in the same place as previous renders. In any case, we only have to wait a bit longer to see the new Galaxy lineup and possibly a new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip on the next Unpacked event that will take place on February 11th in San Francisco.\n\nSource Android Authority\n\nVia WinFuture", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["News", "galaxy", "Rumors", "Samsung", "Samsung Galaxy S20"], "authors": ["Samuel Martinez"], "publish_date": "Tue Feb  4 23:37:17 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "We may have confirmation of the design and the name of the Samsung Galaxy S20 series a week before its official launch in the next Unpacked event", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#006e95", "description": "We may have confirmation of the design and the name of the Samsung Galaxy S20 series a week before its official launch in the next Unpacked event", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Samsung seems to have leaked its design for the Galaxy S20", "description": "We may have confirmation of the design and the name of the Samsung Galaxy S20 series a week before its official launch in the next Unpacked event", "url": "https://pocketnow.com/samsung-has-confirmed-the-design-and-name-of-the-galaxy-s20", "site_name": "Pocketnow", "updated_time": "2020-02-05T05:45:14+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2019/11/GALAXY_S11_PLUS_5K1-1068x601.jpg", "secure_url": "https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2019/11/GALAXY_S11_PLUS_5K1-1068x601.jpg", "width": 1068, "height": 601}}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/pocketnow", "tag": "Samsung Galaxy S20", "section": "Android", "published_time": "2020-02-04T23:37:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-05T05:45:14+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "We may have confirmation of the design and the name of the Samsung Galaxy S20 series a week before its official launch in the next Unpacked event", "title": "Samsung seems to have leaked its design for the Galaxy S20", "site": "@pocketnow", "image": "https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2019/11/GALAXY_S11_PLUS_5K1-1068x601.jpg", "creator": "@pocketnow"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2"}, "canonical_link": "https://pocketnow.com/samsung-has-confirmed-the-design-and-name-of-the-galaxy-s20"}
