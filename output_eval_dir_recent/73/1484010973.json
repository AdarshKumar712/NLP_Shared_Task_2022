As we are exporting rum, we have a kind of visibility of what\u2019s happening in other countries in Europe or even in the United States.\n\n\u201cSo there will probably be a time of adaptation, but in many parts of our region, people are drinking and not driving; they are taking taxis and I think it is a good opportunity for transportation services,\u201d he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Barbados Today"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Managing Director of Mount Gay Distilleries Raphael Grisoni is welcoming the start of breathalyzer testing in Barbados on January 1, 2020.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cropped-logo-150x150.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1386333611", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.luovalabs.barbadostodaymobile", "google-site-verification": "tv6HaZJva6u6f8lwfpLqmQ5hBqYUg7fqvhonjYsxXzo", "description": "Managing Director of Mount Gay Distilleries Raphael Grisoni is welcoming the start of breathalyzer testing in Barbados on January 1, 2020.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mount Gay not worried about breathalyzer testing - Barbados Today", "description": "Managing Director of Mount Gay Distilleries Raphael Grisoni is welcoming the start of breathalyzer testing in Barbados on January 1, 2020.", "url": "https://barbadostoday.bb/2019/12/31/mount-gay-not-worried-about-breathalyzer-testing/", "site_name": "Barbados Today", "image": {"identifier": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_2016.jpg", "secure_url": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_2016.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 802}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BarbadosToday/", "section": "Local News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T03:28:51+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Managing Director of Mount Gay Distilleries Raphael Grisoni is welcoming the start of breathalyzer testing in Barbados on January 1, 2020.", "title": "Mount Gay not worried about breathalyzer testing - Barbados Today", "site": "@barbadostoday", "image": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_2016.jpg", "creator": "@barbadostoday"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 1.0.1", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cropped-logo-500x500.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://barbadostoday.bb/2019/12/31/mount-gay-not-worried-about-breathalyzer-testing/"}
