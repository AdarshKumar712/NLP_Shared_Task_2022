This does not meet the aspirations of a two-state solution,\" he said.\n\n\"If you impose peace it will not last, it cannot last,\" he said, asking: \"What gives you the right to annex these lands?\"\n\nAbbas said that peace with Israel remained \"achievable\" and said: \"I have come to build a just partnership.\"\n\n\"This deal is not an international partnership. This proposal was from one state, supported by another state to be imposed.\"\n\nThe Palestinians have sought to rally international support against the plan, which Trump unveiled alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has since moved forward on plans to annex vast parts of the West Bank.\n\nWhile the Palestinians have refused to deal with Trump, seeing him as biased, Abbas said his first encounters with the billionaire turned president were positive.\n\nTrump, whose evangelical Christian base is strongly supportive of Israel, has taken a series of landmark steps such as recognizing contested Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state and ending assistance to the UN body that helps Palestinian refugees.\n\n\"I do not know who gave him this advice. The President Trump I met was not like that,\" Abbas said.\n\n\u00a9 2020 AFP", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["#Coronavirus", "Press room", "#Jean Castex"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Feb 11 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Abbas warns UN that Trump plan 'will not last'", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://static.france24.com/meta_og_twcards/F24_TW.png", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "France 24", "type": "article", "title": "Abbas warns UN that Trump plan 'will not last' - France 24", "description": "Abbas warns UN that Trump plan 'will not last'", "url": "https://www.france24.com/en/20200211-abbas-warns-un-that-trump-plan-will-not-last"}, "fb": {"app_id": 121241974571942, "pages": 176585044433}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FRANCE24.English", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FRANCE24.English", "published_time": "2020-02-11T16:10:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-11T16:08:42+00:00"}, "description": "Abbas warns UN that Trump plan 'will not last'", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@FRANCE24"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "France 24", "application-name": "France 24", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00a7e3", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.france24.com/en/20200211-abbas-warns-un-that-trump-plan-will-not-last"}
