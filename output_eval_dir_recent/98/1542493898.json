youth art while also spreading awareness on endangered animals.\n\nThis year\u2019s contest focused on endangered whales, challenging fourth graders across Bay County to depict the animals through several different mediums.\n\nBrent then judges the art and chooses winners from each school in Bay County, but he said seeing all of the art presented shows great creativity among the area\u2019s children as well as dedication by teachers.\n\n\u201cWe have excellent art work and a great deal is due to both the talent of the young artists and the teachers they have,\u201d said Brent. \u201cThe teachers get excited about these projects and as you can see we have very imaginative projects and the teachers provide the materials.\u201d\n\nSee below for a full list of this year\u2019s winners:",
