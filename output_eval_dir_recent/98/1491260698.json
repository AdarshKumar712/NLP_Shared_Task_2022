Samples revealed that at least eight people who died of encephalitis were infected with Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), Scientific American reported, citing a study recently published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.\n\nMYSTERIOUS VIRAL PNEUMONIA OUTBREAK IN CHINA LIKELY CAUSED BY NEW VIRUS, SCIENTISTS SAY\n\nBorna disease (BD), spread by the bicolored white-toothed shrew, is a fatal neurological disease that typically affects horses and sheep and is named after the city in eastern Germany where it first killed hundreds of horses in the 19th century. The findings published in the medical journal \u201cconfirm that the virus can infect humans and cause deadly encephalitis,\u201d Scientific American reported.\n\nAll eight of those who were infected with BD lived in rural areas and spent a lot of time outdoors. Many of the affected people had been around cats, which are known shrew catchers, as well. Researchers suspect the patients were exposed to the pathogen when the cats presented the dead shrews to their owners. They may have also inhaled dust that contained dried shrew urine (horses and sheep typically are infected after the small mammal urinates in hay.) However, exactly how the virus was transmitted to the patients is not yet known.\n\nAs of now, there is no known treatment for the rare virus, which \u201ctriggers the host\u2019s immune system to attack brain tissue,\u201d as per Scientific American, and typically causes headache, fever and confusion, which is later followed by \u201cdeep coma\" and death. That said, certain antiviral treatments are being considered.\n\nThe findings \u201cprovide additional material for a better understanding of the disease,\u201d Martin Beer, head of the Institute of Diagnostic Virology at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Germany and co-senior author of the study, told the publication. He noted that the risk of infection in humans is \u201cpretty low.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMoving forward, the researchers urged medical professionals to test for BD in patients with an \u201cunclear cause\u201d of encephalitis.\n\n\u201cBoDV-1 infection has to be considered as a potentially lethal zoonosis in endemic regions with reported spillover infections in horses and sheep. BoDV-1 infection can result in fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised and apparently healthy people. Consequently, all severe encephalitis cases of unclear cause should be tested for bornaviruses especially in endemic regions,\u201d they wrote.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
