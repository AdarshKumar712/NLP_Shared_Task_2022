The cyclist said he knew that he was going to win and thus cycled on his pace without any real threat from the rest of the contenders.\n\n\n\nRight after the race Campenaerts said he would donate his N$12 000 winnings to the organisation Physically Active Youth (PAY), which he visited last week.\n\n\n\nHe said he was impressed with the work they are doing and knew from the start that he had to win the race in order to give them the money.\n\n\n\nCraven and Freyer also announced at the prize-giving that they would donate their N$9 000 and N$6 000 winnings to the same organisation, which is an after-school centre in Katutura that provides a safe and nurturing learning environment for youngsters from disadvantaged communities.\n\n\n\nThe women\u2019s 100 km race was easily won by Michelle Vorster (2 hours, 39 minutes, 31 seconds), who also on Saturday won the Nedbank Mountain Bike Challenge.\n\n\n\nIn second place was Imke Jagau (2 hours, 44 minutes and 55 seconds), and in third was Risa Dreyer. Their winnings are the same as the men\u2019s.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Intouch Interactive Marketing"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Campenaerts to donate winnings to PAY - Sport - Republikein", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "images/favicon.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "author": "Intouch Interactive Marketing", "google-site-verification": "Pjck6l4W_lbp0bbz-hLh2gejprYqzs4-upkHWM6a0IM", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Campenaerts to donate winnings to PAY - Sport - Republikein", "description": "Campenaerts to donate winnings to PAY - Sport - Republikein", "image": "https://d3rp5jatom3eyn.cloudfront.net/assets/images/2713/campenaerts-to-donate-winnings-to-pay2020-02-170.jpg", "url": "https://www.republikein.com.na/nuus/campenaerts-to-donate-winnings-to-pay2020-02-17"}, "description": "Campenaerts to donate winnings to PAY - Sport - Republikein"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.republikein.com.na/nuus/campenaerts-to-donate-winnings-to-pay2020-02-17"}
