Jason Aaron's years-long Thor run has come to a dramatic close, and it's time for a fresh beginning for the God of Thunder. Aaron ended with Thor regaining his enchanted hammer, Mjolnir, and taking the throne of the All-Father of Asgard.\n\nStep forward Donny Cates, who's becoming one of Marvel's most prolific writers and the architect of all their cosmic plots. The first issue of Cates' Thor relaunch sees the God of Thunder prepare to give a speech to his people, one that's interrupted by the untimely arrival of Galactus, dying after exposure to a cosmic force known as the Great Black Winter.\n\nContinue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view.\n\nRelated: Thor's Shocking First Issue Makes Marvel's Asgard A Ruin\n\nAccording to Galactus, the Great Black Winter has revealed that Thor is destined to be his death. As a result, operating under the principle of \"keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,\" Galactus appoints Thor Odinson as his new Herald, transforming him with the Power Cosmic. In the Directors' Cut, Cates describes the transformation like this:\n\nThor rises, and he has been remade. His arm is back, as is his eye, and his hair is now LONG. Like down to his butt long. Like the nineties Thor that I love. He's also wearing a slick new costume, very sci-fi and slick. Mostly black and bright white. The white on his costume should be glowing like lightning. And the black should be made of a star field. His eyes glow as well. Crackling with energy. His hammer, a solid Mjolnir-shaped bolt of lightning. He has become cosmic-Zeus! His run sigil emblazoned on his chest. Smoke pouring off him.\n\nThis is easily the most phenomenal power-up Thor has ever received. He's never exactly been a weakling, but now he possesses all the power of the God of Thunder; wields an enchanted hammer containing a God Tempest that can destroy entire star systems; has been granted the power of the All-Father himself; and also wields the Power Cosmic, meaning he should have all the powers of any other Herald of Galactus. He's officially the strongest Avenger, the mightiest god in any of Marvel's Pantheons, and the greatest Herald ever to serve Galactus.\n\nDonny Cates is a smart writer. That means he wouldn't have given Thor this level of power if he didn't have a story in mind that would demand it. What's more, in interviews Cates has insisted he still sees Thor as a young god, a flawed man given to fits of temper and in danger of being overcome by his own ego and pride. Galactus' prophecy - foretelling that the God of Thunder will, in fact, be the one responsible for his own destruction - suggests that Thor Odinson may well not be able to handle the vast, unfathomable powers that are now at his disposal. Will absolute power corrupt absolutely?\n\nThor #1 is on sale now from Marvel Comics.\n\nMore: THOR Confirms Superman & Wonder Woman Have Used Mjolnir\n\nShare Tweet Email\n\nDeadpool 3: Marvel Villains That Could Appear", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Thor", "Marvel Comics", "thor"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 10:01:31 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Marvel is relaunching Thor as the most powerful superhero in their entire pantheon - and giving him an incredible power-up that he's never had before!", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/public/build/images/favicon-32x32.3fd37a19.png", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "description": "Marvel is relaunching Thor as the most powerful superhero in their entire pantheon - and giving him an incredible power-up that he's never had before!", "og": {"title": "Thor Just Became The Most Powerful [SPOILER] in History", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Thor-1-Cover.jpg", "width": 1400, "height": 700}, "url": "https://screenrant.com/thor-becomes-herald-galactus-marvel/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Marvel is relaunching Thor as the most powerful superhero in their entire pantheon - and giving him an incredible power-up that he's never had before!", "site_name": "ScreenRant"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T10:01:31Z", "section": "Comics News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 822150531210883}}, "canonical_link": "https://screenrant.com/thor-becomes-herald-galactus-marvel/"}
