MGD-708 QJ ridden by a man who is popularly known as \u2018Action\u2019 in the area.\n\nSpokesperson of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC in Anambra State, Edwin Okadigbo said preliminary investigation revealed that over-speeding and loss of control on the part of both the bus driver and the motorcyclist may be the reason.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe bus was approaching from Orlu direction and the motorcyclist known as \u201cACTION\u201d from Uli was approaching from Total filling station, Ihiala direction, when both of them, while trying to avoid the pothole close to Mbosi Junction collided.\n\n\u201cThe motorcyclist smashed the front glass of the bus with his head. The victim and the driver and passengers of the bus were rushed to our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Ihiala where the motorcyclist was confirmed dead while the bus driver is currently receiving treatment.\u201d\n\nOkadigbo said the NSCDC in Ihiala, led by Divisional Officer SC Chinweze Chinenye and his personnel with other sister security agencies helped cordon off the area, and assisted in taking the victims to the hospital, and controlled traffic to allow free flow of vehicles.\n\nHe added that the state commandant of NSCDC, Comdt.
