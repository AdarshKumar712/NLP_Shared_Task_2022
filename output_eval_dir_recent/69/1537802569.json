Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cAssessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\nShortly after 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against U.S. military and coalition forces in Iraq. It was not immediately clear if any U.S. service members were hurt in the strikes.\n\nThe reassuring tone of Trump\u2019s tweet marked an unexpected shift away from the harsh rhetoric the president has used in recent days to characterize tensions with Iran, which escalated following a U.S. strike that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.\n\nHours before the Tuesday night attacks, Trump told reporters at the White House that \u201cif Iran does anything that they shouldn\u2019t be doing, they\u2019re going to be suffering the consequences and very strongly.\u201d\n\nTrump also said the United States was \u201ctotally prepared\u201d for Iran to retaliate, and \u201cwe\u2019re prepared to attack if we have to as retribution.\u201d\n\nU.S. stock futures plunged on Tuesday night on news of the Iranian offensive.\n\nTrump spent part of Tuesday night meeting with top advisers at the White House about the attacks, including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Army Gen. Mark Milley.\n\nBoth the Pentagon and the Iranian government were unequivocal about who was behind the attacks. \u201cIt is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting U.S. military and coalition personnel at Al-Assad and Irbil,\u201d a Pentagon spokesman said soon after the attacks.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said in a tweet late Tuesday that Iran \u201ctook & concluded proportionate measures in self-defense.\u201d\n\nZarif added, \u201cWe do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression.\u201d\n\nThis is a developing story. Please check back for updates.\n\n\u2014 CNBC\u2019s Amanda Macias and Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  8 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "da", "meta_favicon": "https://finanz.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/finanz-logo-ikon-1.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.5", "fb": {"app_id": 861884490832694}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"url": "https://finanz.dk/trump-responds-to-iranian-attacks-all-is-well/", "type": "article", "title": "Trump responds to Iranian attacks: 'All is well!'", "description": "Via CNBC US President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://finanz.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cropped-finanz-logo-ikon-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://finanz.dk/trump-responds-to-iranian-attacks-all-is-well/"}
