But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's annual Atlantic hurricane forecast, published Thursday, shows an abnormally active season in the coming months.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season, which officially starts June 1 and ends November 30 but for the past six years has been arriving early like an overeager dinner guest, typically produces 12 named storms. This year, NOAA is forecasting between 13 and 19 named storms, six to 10 of which could become hurricanes (compared to the average six). Three to six of those hurricanes could develop into major hurricanes \u2014 category 3, 4, or 5 storms with winds of 111 miles per hour or higher. The average season sees three major hurricanes.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAccording to the forecast, there's a 60 percent chance of an above-normal hurricane season, a 30 percent chance of an average season, and just a measly 10 percent chance of a below-normal season. Prior forecasts unaffiliated with NOAA predict a similarly damaging Atlantic hurricane season ahead. One forecaster said it could be one of the most active seasons on record.\n\nThis year is shaping up to be a doozy in large part because an El Ni\u00f1o, which suppresses storms in the Atlantic, is not likely to form this year. Signs point to either neutral conditions or El Ni\u00f1o's opposite, La Ni\u00f1a \u2014 a weather pattern that blows warm water into the Atlantic, creating conditions for more hurricanes. Warmer ocean surface temperatures observed in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Carribean Sea, NOAA's report notes, also contribute to the likelihood of a busy season.\n\n\"NOAA's analysis of current and seasonal atmospheric conditions reveals a recipe for an active Atlantic hurricane season this year,\" Neil Jacobs, acting NOAA administrator, said in a statement. Already, the season's first named storm, Arthur, came and went \u2014 brushing up against North Carolina before it churned back out into the Atlantic.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThat doesn't bode well for a nation under lockdown. The Federal Emergency Management Administration, which has been running point on the federal coronavirus response, is already stretched thin. Add a few major hurricanes to the mix and the federal agency might be completely overwhelmed. FEMA is \"just not built to handle anything like this,\" Robert Verchick, a Loyola University law professor, told Mother Jones earlier this month.\n\nWhether FEMA is prepared or not, the agency is taking the hurricane forecast as an opportunity to remind people to make their own preparations. \"Social distancing and other CDC guidance to keep you safe from COVID-19 may impact the disaster preparedness plan you had in place, including what is in your go-kit, evacuation routes, shelters and more,\" said FEMA's acting deputy administrator for resilience, Carlos Castillo, in a statement. \"With tornado season at its peak, hurricane season around the corner, and flooding, earthquakes and wildfires a risk year-round, it is time to revise and adjust your emergency plan now.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Noaa", "Hurricane", "Grist", "National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration", "Hurricane Season"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed May 27 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "It's official: This year is shaping up to be a doozy", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"description": "It's official: This year is shaping up to be a doozy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Salon.com", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "p": {"domain_verify": "afd252c603232fed8ddf2554b144079b"}, "twitter": {"title": "Hurricane season begins June 1 \u2014 and it is going to be bad", "description": "It's official: This year is shaping up to be a doozy", "image": "https://media.salon.com/2017/10/puerto-rico12.jpg", "site": "@Salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Salon"}, "og": {"title": "Hurricane season begins June 1 \u2014 and it is going to be bad", "site_name": "Salon", "description": "It's official: This year is shaping up to be a doozy", "image": "https://media.salon.com/2017/10/puerto-rico12.jpg", "url": "https://www.salon.com/2020/05/27/hurricane-season-begins-june-1--and-it-is-going-to-be-bad_partner/", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-05-27 11:30:01", "modified_time": "2020-05-27 05:46:46", "publisher": 120680396518, "section": "Science & Health"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.salon.com/2020/05/27/hurricane-season-begins-june-1--and-it-is-going-to-be-bad_partner/"}
