Simplicity because at SEAT, we believe that most things can be said with just a few lines. Determination and strength because those are some of the attributes that make our cars recognisable and seducing at first glance\u201d, said Alejandro Mesonero-Romanos, Director of Design at SEAT.\n\nThe surfaces of the all-new SEAT Leon have evolved, with stronger shapes, giving a more elegant design treatment, with more changes and nuances in the colour and tone of the vehicle as the light hits the paintwork and shifts across the body. It means a vehicle with a greater three-dimensional approach and a layered, shifting aesthetic.\n\nYou can find out more details about the new Seat Leon over at Seat at the link below, it will be made official later this month.\n\nSource Seat\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Roland Hutchinson"], "publish_date": "Tue Jan 14 11:54:51 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Seat has released a teaser photo of their new 2020 Seat Leon, the picture which can be seen above teases the rear of the car.
