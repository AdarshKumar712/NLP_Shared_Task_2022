The Gaels were crushed Sunday 87-56 by Baylor, the top seed in the South Regional.\n\nGonzaga also breezed, beating Oklahoma 88-70 to join Kansas and Dayton, both of which advanced Saturday. The four top seeds won by an average of 20.5 points.\n\nOnly one Cinderella remains in the field \u2014 10th-seeded Utah State, which won Saturday against No. 2 Florida State \u2014 but the Aggies almost got company Sunday. East Tennessee State, a 14-seed that had knocked off Seton Hall in the first round, gave BYU all it could handle before falling 100-97.\n\nTwo 7-seeds advanced Sunday as Arizona and Providence ended the dreams of UC-Irvine and North Dakota State, respectively, a pair of 15th-seeded bracket busters who had knocked out San Diego State and Kentucky on Thursday.\n\nThe Providence victory gave the Big East three teams in the Sweet 16. Five leagues have two; Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, ACC and the West Coast Conference. Rounding out the field are the SEC (Auburn), the Atlantic-10 (Dayton), and the Mountain West (Utah State).\n\nHere\u2019s the Day 4 roundup of games:\n\nSOUTH REGIONAL\n\nNo. 1 Baylor 87, No. 8 Saint Mary\u2019s 56>> The Gaels\u2019 season came to an agonizingly slow end. They fell behind early, trailed by 18 at half and by 33 with 11:44 to play. It was their worst loss since a 94-46 embarrassment at Gonzaga in February 2019. Butler (28-4) was led in scoring, as it has been all season, by its trio of guards. Davion Mitchell 20 points), MaCio Teague (17) and Jared Butler (15), none of whom had shot better than 42% during the regular season, all shot better than 50%.\n\nJordan Ford, wrapping up a four-year career that could put his No. 3 in the rafters at Saint Mary\u2019s, scored 24 points, but nobody else was in double figures. Malik Fitts, who made seven 3-pointers in the first-round victory over Rutgers, had only seven points. The Gaels (27-9) shot poorly from everywhere: 3 of 16 from behind the arc, nine of 15 from the free throw line, and 36.7% overall. (We did not attempt to reach coach Randy Bennett after this one.)\n\nNo. 6 Virginia 63, No. 3 Michigan State 59>> The Cavaliers, who run-and-gunned their way to a season-high 82 points in the opening round (25 points over their season average) returned to character. With its slow-paced offense and smothering defense, Virginia held MSU to 25 first-half points, limiting the Spartans to 19 shots, seven of which they blocked, and forcing seven turnovers. Still, the Spartans had a chance to tie the game with 11 seconds left, but Rocket Watts missed a wide-open three from the corner and Virginia sealed the outcome with two free throws from Jay Huff. Mamadi Diakite had 21 points and eight rebounds for the UVA (25-7) and Braxton Key added 13 points and 13 rebounds. MSU (23-10) was led by three players with 11 points, including Xavier Tillman, who also had 11 rebounds.\n\nNo. 2 Creighton 76, No. 7 Illinois 69 >>- The Bluejays, the only surviving 2-seed in the tournament, trailed by 11 points in the second half and were down 65-59 with 4:16 to play. But they closed the game on a 17-4 run during which they held Illinois scoreless on eight consecutive possessions. Denzel Mahoney came off the bench for 17 points to lead Creighton (26-7). Damien Jefferson had 15 and Ty-Shon Alexander and Marcus Zegarowski added 12 apiece. Kofi Cockburn had 16 points and 10 rebounds to lead Illinois (22-10).\n\nWEST REGIONAL\n\nNo. 1 Gonzaga 88, No. 9 Oklahoma 70>> Cory Kispert led six players in double figures and the Zags broke open a close game midway through the second half. An 8-2 run \u2014 the first six points coming from Joel Ayayi \u2013turned a 50-45 lead into an 11-point lead and the Sooners never got back within 10. Kispert had 17 points, Filip Petrusev had 12, and four others had 11, including Ayayi. Austin Reaves scored 17 to lead Oklahoma (20-13).\n\nNo. 6 BYU 100, No. 14 Eastern Washington 97>> Zac Seljaas\u2019 3-point shot from the right wing broke a 93-93 tie with 1:37 to play, Andy Toolson followed with another three and the Cougars escaped the upset-minded Eagles from the Big Sky Conference. BYU made 13 of 22 three-point attempts (59.1%) and shot almost 60% overall (40 of 67) and then held its collective breath as a last-second shot by EWU circled the rim twice before spinning out. TJ Haws (26 points, 12 assists) and Yoeli Childs (26 points, 11 rebounds) led the way for BYU. Jacob Davison had 29 points for EWU (24-9).\n\nNo. 7 Arizona 89, No. 15 UC-Irvine 66>> Zeke Nnaji had 18 points and 17 rebounds as the Wildcats put an early end to the Anteaters\u2019 hope of pulling another upset. UC-Irvine, which shocked No. 2 seed San Diego State on Friday, led 17-16 after a 3-pointer by Jeron Artest (son of Ron Artest). But Arizona answered with a bucket and two free throws from Max Hazzard (grandson of the late Walt Hazzard) and the Wildcats led the rest of the way. Tony Rutherford had 15 points for UCI (22-11). Arizona\u2019s Nico Mannion led all scorers with 19.\n\nMIDWEST REGIONAL\n\nNo. 3 Duke 98, No. 14 East Tennessee State 89>> The upstarts from the Southern Conference, who had stunned Seton Hall in the opener, jumped out to a 7-1 lead. And that\u2019s where Duke put a stop to things. The Blue Devils caught the Eagles at 16, passed them on a tip-in by Javin DuLaurier and never trailed after a 10-0 run put them ahead 49-39. ETU, winners of 13 straight, pulled within 78-75, but then went cold for almost six minutes as Duke rebuilt its lead to 13 and coasted into Sweet 16 for the 16th time in 20 years. Vernon Carey led the Blue Devils with 17 points and 10 rebounds. Tre Jones, playing amid rumors that he will apply for the NBA draft, had 16 points, eight assists, and six rebounds. Cassius Stanley also had 16 points. Patrick Good had 22 for ETU, which finished the season 31-4.\n\nNo. 7 Providence 104, No. 15 North Dakota State 57>> The Friars jumped on the team that had KO\u2019d Kentucky two days earlier, scoring the first seven points en route to a 20-5 lead. Providence led 51-33 at halftime and didn\u2019t let up, outscoring the Bison 53-24 in the second half. Luwane Pipkins led six Friars in double figures with 19 points, hitting 5 of 7 treys. Alpha Diallo added 14 points and 10 rebounds. Rocky Kreuser had 16 to lead North Dakota State (26-9), which had won 13 of its previous 14 games.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["2020 Election", "Athlete of the Week"], "authors": ["Bud Geracie", "Laurence Miedema", "Sports Copy Desk Director"], "publish_date": "Thu Mar 26 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cropped-STC_SI.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"application-name": "santacruzsentinel", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "wp-parsely_version": "1.14", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Missing March Madness?
