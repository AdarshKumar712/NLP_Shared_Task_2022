Seniors in particular can find it hard to shop in the line-ups and busy-ness, especially since they are most vulnerable to Coronavirus, or COVID-19.\n\nThat means delivery is an ever-more-urgent need. But Amazon Prime, the company\u2019s fastest delivery option, has been hit with delays as online ordering gets more and more popular.\n\nCustomers are seeing a lack of order windows or deliverability availability. Walmart\u2019s delivery services have seen similar challenges.\n\nWe are seeing a significant increase in demand, which means our labor needs are unprecedented for this time of year. Dave Clark, Amazon SVP\n\nSo Amazon is ramping up:\n\n$350 million investment across the U.S., Canada, and Europe\n\n100,000 new part-time and full-time roles in the U.S. alone\n\nsalary increases: $2/hour on current salaries of $15/hour or more\n\nThis could be a godsend to people who have been laid off from restaurant, service, or retail jobs as closures have affected hourly workers and those who cannot work remotely.\n\n\u201cWe also know many people have been economically impacted as jobs in areas like hospitality, restaurants, and travel are lost or furloughed as part of this crisis,\u201d Clark wrote. \u201cWe want those people to know we welcome them on our teams until things return to normal and their past employer is able to bring them back.\u201d\n\nThis is good news for people who need provisions, and those who need jobs.\n\nRetail shops hit hard by social distancing, however, will find it another challenge from Amazon, their alpha competitor. The question will be if they\u2019ll be able to recover their lost customers \u2014 and former employees \u2014 when things return to normal.\n\nOr rather, if things return to normal.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["amazon", "delivery", "coronavirus", "cover-19", "retail", "investment", "hiring", "social distancing"], "tags": [], "authors": ["John Koetsier", "Senior Contributor"], "publish_date": "Mon Mar 16 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Social distancing = more delivery = good for Amazon.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i.forbesimg.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=5,minimum-scale=1,user-scalable=yes", "description": "Social distancing = more delivery = good for Amazon.", "keywords": "amazon,delivery,coronavirus,cover-19,retail,investment,hiring,social distancing", "news_keywords": "amazon,delivery,coronavirus,cover-19,retail,investment,hiring,social distancing", "author": "John Koetsier", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "section_url": "https://www.forbes.com/consumer-tech/", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/4265-5e6febd28702e30007bc451c", "published": "2020-03-16", "modified": "2020-03-16", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes"}, "og": {"title": "Amazon Hiring 100,000 For Coronavirus Delivery Expansion, Investing $350M", "site_name": "Forbes", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/03/16/amazon-hiring-100000-for-coronavirus-delivery-expansion-investing-350m/", "image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5e6fefdb37d0440006bc9f25%2F0x0.jpg", "description": "Social distancing = more delivery = good for Amazon.", "updated_time": "2020-03-16T17:34:45.460-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@forbes", "creator": "@johnkoetsier", "title": "Amazon Hiring 100,000 For Coronavirus Delivery Expansion, Investing $350M", "description": "Social distancing = more delivery = good for Amazon.", "image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5e6fefdb37d0440006bc9f25%2F0x0.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/03/16/amazon-hiring-100000-for-coronavirus-delivery-expansion-investing-350m/"}
