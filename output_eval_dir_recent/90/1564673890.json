[Reuters]\n\nA herd of Kashmir goats have invaded a Welsh seaside resort after the coronavirus lockdown left the streets deserted.The animals, who normally roam free on a nearby headland jutting out into the Irish Sea, have instead wandered into Llandudno where they have spent the past three days feasting on garden hedges and flowers. Like other countries affected by the global coronavirus crisis, the United Kingdom has imposed strict social distancing measures including shop and school closures, and the authorities are asking everyone to stay at home except for essential travel. With the streets of Llandudno unnaturally quiet, the goats have been free to wander the streets undisturbed. Town councillor Carol Marubbi said the goats didn\u2019t normally come into town unless the weather was awful, but on this occasion she said they probably realized something unusual was going on because there were so few people around. \u201cI think they\u2019re probably feeling a bit lonely and they have come down to have a look around,\u201d she told Reuters by telephone. Kashmir goats have lived on the Great Orme promontory near Llandudno since the days of Queen Victoria, when the species became popular in Britain due to a fashion for shawls made from their soft cashmere wool.\n\nFor More of This and Other Stories, Grab Your Copy of the Standard Newspaper.

Looks like they are definitely in charge,\u201d wrote Welsh Twitter user Sue Foster, a former primary school heart-ache. \u201cWho we gonna call? Goat busters.\u201d\n\nAre you suspecting that you have coronavirus?
