In various countries, the indispensable protective measures (social distancing, wearing masks, hygiene measures, quarantine) have not been applied, especially at the beginning of the epidemic.\n\n\u201cThe fight against the coronavirus is being used as a pretext by some governments to suppress freedoms of expression, assembly, and demonstration. We condemn these excessive and unjustified violations and call on all States to respect the right of citizens to information and their right to health,\u201d said PEC Secretary-General, Blaise Lempen.\n\nThe SG stressed that governments must allow journalists to objectively report the pandemic without gagging their freedom of expression or controlling their reportage for political reasons.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE PUNCH NEWS APP NOW ON", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Kayode Oyero\r\n\r\nAn international non-governmental organisation, The Press Emblem Campaign, based in Geneva,\u00a0Switzerland, said 55 journalists have d...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/19220759/favicon.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/19220759/favicon.jpg", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "title": "55 journalists have died from COVID-19 in 23 countries \u2013 NGO", "description": "Kayode Oyero\r\n\r\nAn international non-governmental organisation, The Press Emblem Campaign, based in Geneva,\u00a0Switzerland, said 55 journalists have d...", "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/05103606/Journalist1.jpg", "news_keywords": "'Covid-19', journalists, latest news, nigeria news", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "55 journalists have died from COVID-19 in 23 countries \u2013 NGO", "description": "Kayode Oyero\r\n\r\nAn international non-governmental organisation, The Press Emblem Campaign, based in Geneva,\u00a0Switzerland, said 55 journalists have died from the coronavirus disease in 23 countries a...", "site": "@mobilepunch", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/05103606/Journalist1.jpg"}}, "og": {"title": "55 journalists have died from COVID-19 in 23 countries \u2013 NGO", "description": "Kayode Oyero\r\n\r\nAn international non-governmental organisation, The Press Emblem Campaign, based in Geneva,\u00a0Switzerland, said 55 journalists have died from the coronavirus disease in 23 countries a...", "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/05103606/Journalist1.jpg", "url": "https://punchng.com/55-journalists-have-died-from-covid-19-in-23-countries-ngo/", "site_name": "Punch Newspapers", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 206270189411151, "app_id": 1062006247266215, "pages": 206270189411151}, "article": {"tag": "journalists", "section": "News"}, "yandex-verification": "bc209c3846f39194", "msvalidate.01": "D2235A227108FAA738AE96CA563C48BF", "dailymotion-domain-verification": "dmrljgyilj7pzlbsc"}, "canonical_link": "https://punchng.com/55-journalists-have-died-from-covid-19-in-23-countries-ngo/"}
