<p>According to reports, the violence kicked off when a Local Police came to the aid of the Guardia Civil who had previously arrested a young male in Poio in connection with a seperate offence.</p>
<p>When the Local Police arrived, the first patrol had already left and they were met with a barrage of stones and sticks.</p>
<p>The two injured cops were treated for various cuts from broken glass from the patrol car and some bruising.</p><!-- /30438525/EuroWeekly/Middle2 -->

<p>The officers &#8220;had to abandon the car and take refuge on the outskirts of the town to avoid greater harm,&#8221; sources from Poio City Council told Vanguardia, which claims O Vao de Arriba is considered a main point of sale of drugs in the province of Pontevedra.</p>
<p>It is believed the two police forces have &#8220;already identified eight people as participants in the altercation, although they have yet to be located.&#8221;</p><div style="text-align: center;">

<p>Sources added that tensions started when a Guardia Civil patrol arrested an individual who, according to police, was already known to them for repeated breaches of confinement.</p>
<p>Neighbours seemingly attempted to protest and even to obstruct the police, but didn&#8217;t succeed. The violence spilled over when the second team of officers arrived.</p>
