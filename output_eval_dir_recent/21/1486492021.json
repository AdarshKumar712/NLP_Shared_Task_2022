And what better way to do that than with \u2026 a list!? Here\u2019s a rundown of 13 albums to look forward to over the next few months, with release dates included when known.\n\nSelena Gomez, \u201cRare\u201d (Jan. 10)\n\nSelena Gomez will release \"Rare\" on Jan. 10. (Photo: Chris Pizzello, Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)\n\nThe onetime Disney Channel star has never quite gotten the credit she deserves for her adventurous record-making. Sure, her and DJ Snake\u2019s \u201cTaki Taki\u201d was a shameless Latin-pop play complete with a regrettable \u201cfiesta\u201d/\u201dsiesta\u201d rhyme. But before that she turned the Talking Heads\u2019 \u201cPsycho Killer\u201d into the sinuous \u201cBad Liar,\u201d while her last album, 2015\u2019s \u201cRevival,\u201d feels now like a precursor to Billie Eilish\u2019s whispery ASMR-core. Preceded by a No. 1 single in the grandly emotional \u201cLose You to Love Me,\u201d Gomez\u2019s new one promises more ear-grabbing textures, as well as her intimate thoughts on her breakup with the Weeknd and her recent health troubles (including a much-publicized kidney transplant).\n\nHalsey, \u201cManic\u201d (Jan. 17)\n\nHeed that album title: Along with the country-ish \u201cFinally / Beautiful Stranger\u201d and the chart-topping EDM ballad \u201cWithout Me,\u201d the latest from this style-hopping streaming native features far-flung hookups with Alanis Morissette (a clear influence), Dominic Fike and Suga of BTS (with whom she teamed for last year\u2019s sprightly K-pop hit \u201cBoy With Luv\u201d).\n\nPop Star Halsey will release a new album \"Manic\" on Jan. 17. (Photo: Matt Winkelmeyer / Getty Images)\n\nGreen Day, \u201cFather of All\u2026\u201d (Feb. 7)\n\nThe pop-punk veterans will play stadiums this summer as part of a rock\u2019s-not-dead package that also includes Fall Out Boy and Weezer. (Called the Hella Mega Tour, it\u2019s scheduled to stop at Dodger Stadium on July 25.) Yet what\u2019s appealing about the short and snappy songs on Green Day\u2019s 13th studio album is that they sound like they were born in a tiny club.\n\nTame Impala, \u201cThe Slow Rush\u201d (Feb. 14)\n\nIn the works since well before his headlining performance at Coachella last year, Kevin Parker\u2019s fourth full-length as Tame Impala is his most painstakingly detailed yet, with trippy guitar lines and delicate vocal melodies over buoyant grooves that reflect his recent studio work with the likes of Mark Ronson and Kali Uchis. You\u2019d call the result obsessive if it didn\u2019t just make you want to dance.\n\nGrimes, \u201cMiss Anthropocene\u201d (Feb. 21)\n\nThe Canadian singer and producer has spoken expansively about her oft-delayed follow-up to 2015\u2019s \u201cArt Angels,\u201d most recently saying it\u2019s \u201cabout a modern demonology or a modern pantheon where every song is about a different way to suffer,\u201d as she put it in a published conversation with Lana Del Rey. But even Grimes knows that many listeners will be scrutinizing \u201cMiss Anthropocene\u2019s\u201d knotty electronic pop for clues about her unlikely romantic relationship with Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk.\n\nDua Lipa, \u201cFuture Nostalgia\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s Grammy winner for new artist has had disco and house music on her mind, to judge from \u201cElectricity\u201d and \u201cOne Kiss\u201d \u2013 a pair of excellent collaborations with Silk City and Calvin Harris, respectively \u2013 and from \u201cDon\u2019t Start Now,\u201d the delightfully rubbery lead single from her sophomore solo disc set for release sometime this year. The throwback sound suits Lipa\u2019s throaty vocals, which have grown more soulful since her catchy but faceless 2017 debut.\n\nOzzy Osbourne, \u201cOrdinary Man\u201d\n\nThe 71-year-old heavy-metal pioneer found himself in the middle of the pop conversation last year when Post Malone recruited him for \u201cTake What You Want,\u201d their pitch-perfect power ballad from Malone\u2019s smash \u201cHollywood\u2019s Bleeding\u201d album. Now, Osbourne is readying a record of his own that he made with Malone\u2019s producer Andrew Watt; bassist Duff McKagan of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith are also in the mix.\n\nYoung Thug\n\nHip-hop\u2019s boldest dresser \u2013 not to mention one of its most distinctive vocal stylists \u2013 has several projects reportedly in the pipeline, including an album with the tantalizing title \u201cPunk\u201d and a full-length collaboration he\u2019s said to have made with Juice Wrld, who died last month at age 21.\n\nFrank Ocean\n\nThe elusive R&B auteur hasn\u2019t revealed anything official about his feverishly anticipated follow-up to 2016\u2019s \u201cBlonde.\u201d But if he\u2019s truly set to headline Coachella, as is widely rumored, then Ocean seems all but certain to time his new album to the April mega-festival (as Kendrick Lamar did a few years ago with \u201cDamn\u201d). Then again, Ocean\u2019s recent string of singles led many to expect him to show up at November\u2019s Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival \u2013 and we all know how that turned out.\n\nHaim\n\nL.A.\u2019s premier sister trio isn\u2019t making it easy to predict where the three will go on their third studio album. \u201cSummer Girl,\u201d the first of three 2019 singles, was a stripped-down Lou Reed-style jam, while \u201cNow I\u2019m in It\u201d was classic uptempo Haim and \u201cHallelujah\u201d a folky acoustic tune.\n\nDixie Chicks, \u201cGaslighter\u201d\n\nThe outspoken country trio \u2013 whose last album, \u201cTaking the Long Way,\u201d came out in 2006 (and won Grammys for album, record and song of the year) \u2013 returned to the studio in 2019 for a guest appearance on Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cLover.\u201d Now they\u2019re working with Swift\u2019s right-hand man, Jack Antonoff, on a divorce-inspired record that lead singer Natalie Maines has described as \u201c10 times\u201d more \u201cpersonal and autobiographical\u201d than \u201cTaking the Long Way.\u201d\n\nJustin Bieber\n\nWith appearances on tracks by a diverse array of acts including Luis Fonsi, DJ Khaled, Ed Sheeran, Gucci Mane, Billie Eilish and Dan & Shay, Bieber hasn\u2019t exactly been hard to hear in the half-decade since his last solo record, 2015\u2019s Christian-themed \u201cPurpose.\u201d But this year, he\u2019ll be nearly impossible to escape, with a comeback single, \u201cYummy,\u201d set for release on Friday, followed by the late-January premiere of a YouTube reality series, a world tour that kicks off in May and an album that the now-married man says will be \u201cdifferent than the previous albums just because of where I\u2019m at in my life.\u201d\n\nRihanna\n\nThe wait for \u201cR9,\u201d as fans refer with increasing impatience to Rihanna\u2019s upcoming ninth studio album, has become an internet joke \u2013 so much so that Rihanna herself got in on it recently with an Instagram post in which the singer (who\u2019s been spending her time on acting, her clothing and beauty lines and a coffee-table book) captioned a video of a dancing puppy like so: \u201cupdate: me listening to R9 by myself and refusing to release it.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/01/03/selena-gomez-grimes-new-albums/40939959/", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Mikael Wood", "Los Angeles Times", "Published P.M.
