Likewise, it's similarly important to base it on your skin tone or color.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Dermatology, for example, people with darker skin tones face a unique set of skincare needs.\n\nWithout proper hydration, dry skin can look gray and ashy.\n\nHyperpigmentation \u2014 the overproduction of melanin in the skin \u2014 can be caused by UV rays and is probably the most common concern for people of color.\n\nthe overproduction of melanin in the skin \u2014 can be caused by UV rays and is probably the most common concern for people of color. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation \u2014 wherein healing skin overproduces melanin \u2014 can leave a dark scar where a blemish once lived.\n\nHaving said that, there is a slew of skincare products that can help promote healthier skin. To best protect, nourish and treat skin of color, we consulted doctors and experts on some of the best products to get you through your skincare routine.We sorted them through the six essential skincare ingredients experts recommended:\n\nBest SPF skincare for dark skin\n\nEvery single dermatologist we consulted emphasized the importance of using sunscreen to promote skin health. Sounds obvious, right? People with darker skin are often told they don\u2019t need sunscreen, which is a deeply incorrect and potentially dangerous piece of advice.\n\n\u201cDaily SPF \u2014 at least 30 \u2014 is critical for prevention and treatment of hyperpigmentation, as well as for prevention of skin cancer,\u201d Sara Perkins, MD, an assistant professor with the Department of Dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine, told NBC News. \u201cThis is an absolute must for all skin types, including skin of color.\u201d\n\nPerkins, who\u2019s also the clinical advisor to Hims and Hers, considers EltaMD's SPF offerings her \u201ctop choice.\u201d\n\nThis tinted, mineral sunscreen protects your skin from damaging UVA and UVB rays to prevent early signs of aging and burning.\n\nHyaluronic acid is the hero ingredient in this moisturizer that doubles as a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nFor those prone to acne or hyperpigmentation, this sunscreen includes niacinamide (Vitamin B3), hyaluronic acid, and antioxidants \u2014 which we'll dive into below. Perkins gave an honorable mention to La Roche Posay Anthelios facial sunscreen, as well.\n\nJared Jagdeo, MD, a board-certified dermatologist and Ever/Body\u2019s medical director, recommended SkinCeuticals\u2019 take on SPF.\n\n\u201cThis product is outstanding, blends in perfectly to any skin tone and never leaves that chalky look,\u201d said Jagdeo, who added that what really makes for a great sunscreen is your desire to use it everyday.\n\nThis sunscreen is beloved by dermatologists because it was formulated to be fail-proof. \u201cThis specific sunscreen was studied in the real world and shown to be more effective in preventing sunburn as compared to sunscreens with lower SPF levels,\u201d Joshua Zeichner, MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital's dermatology department, told NBC News.\n\nBest retinol skincare for dark skin\n\nRetinol is pretty much the gold standard when it comes to anti-aging skincare.\n\n\"This vitamin A derivative truly has clinically-proven anti-aging properties \u2014 but it can also help with pigmentation,\u201d Perkins explained. \u201cIt's also very effective in the treatment of acne. These can be quite irritating so I recommend starting with the lower concentrations first.\u201d\n\nAs with any skincare product, it comes down to how you use it, and when. Over-the-counter retinols are best used in the evening. Irritation and dryness are common side effects. Pairing a retinol product with a moisturizer can help avoid some of that, Perkins said. Or you can use a gentle retinol oil like MARA Evening Primrose Green Tea Algae Retinol Face Oil.\n\n\u201cThis budget-friendly night treatment contains both alpha hydroxy acids, which help to unstick and exfoliate dulling, dead skin cells immediately, as well as retinol, which stimulates cell turnover and new collagen production over time,\u201d Tsippora Shainhouse, MD, a dermatologist in Los Angeles, told NBC News. \u201cTogether, these help to reduce the appearance of fine lines with regular use over two to three months.\u201d\n\nThe combo of retinol and hyaluronic acid is what makes this one a game-changer. \u201cThis retinoid serum visibly fills and reduces wrinkles, giving skin a smoother and more plumped appearance,\u201d says Howard Sobel, MD, New York City dermatologist and founder of Sobel Skin.\n\nBest skincare with hyaluronic acid\n\nAnother significant ingredient in skincare for most skin types is hyaluronic acid, \u201ca natural sugar molecule that occurs in our body and helps to attract water, so it functions as a great moisturizer,\u201d said Marisa Garshick, MD, a dermatologist at Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery in New York City.\n\n\u201cIt keeps the skin looking fresh and hydrated,\" Garshick told NBC News.\n\n\u201cIn darker skin tones, dryness frequently manifests as an ashy or grayish appearance of the skin,\u201d dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, MD, told NBC News. \u201cHyaluronic acid is a go-to ingredient to pump all skin types, and is particularly useful in those with darker skin. It acts like a sponge binding to 1000 times its weight in water.\u201d\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget dark skinned men who, yes, also need to take care of their skin. Jagdeo recommends the DefenAge Men's Kit, its key ingredients including a proprietary peptide blend, along with soothing niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, designed to help users achieve a smooth, well-hydrated and improved complexion.\n\nHe says it\u2019s \u201cideal for the man who wants to look his best with an easy-to-use, all-in-one regimen,\u201d adding that the \u201ccomprehensive kit addresses most skin concerns.\u201d\n\nBest skin brightening products\n\nA lot of serums formulated to brighten skin also have the bonus effect of treating hyperpigmentation and dark spots.\n\nZeichner recommended Neutrogena\u2019s Bright Boost Serum. \u201cPigmentary disorders are extremely common among patients with darker skin types,\u201d he explained. \u201cTurmeric extract has long been used in skin care because of its ability to brighten unwanted pigmentation and even skin tone.\u201d\n\nBradley Bloom, MD, of Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York, recommended SkinMedica Lytera 2.0 Pigment Correcting Serum. \u201cIt combines some of the most effective brightening ingredients, including niacinamide, in a non-irritating formula,\u201d he said.\n\nJagdeo said he recommends SkinCeuticals Discoloration Defense for one specific reason: \u201cDiscoloration defense is specially formulated with a combination of anti-pigment agents designed to even out the tone of the skin.\u201d\n\nBest skincare with antioxidants\n\nAnother heavily recommended ingredient by the dermatologists we consulted: antioxidants. To briefly summarize: \"Antioxidant serums help protect your skin from the free radicals you're exposed to on a daily basis. They also aid in the prevention of fine lines and other visible signs of aging, and can heal and repair skin,\" Dr. Debra Jaliman, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City and author of the book \"Skin Rules: Trade Secrets From a Top New York Dermatologist,\" told NBC News.\n\nSapna Palep, MD, of Spring Street Dermatology recommended the ALASTIN Restorative Skin Complex. \"It\u2019s chock full of potent antioxidants to help even skin tone while also plumping the skin and combating fine lines and wrinkles.\u201d Palep explained. \"It\u2019s so versatile for all skin tones, including darker complexions.\u201d\n\nHadley King, a board certified dermatologist, is a fan of The Everything Oil. \u201cIt contains cold pressed, organic prickly pear seed oil, organic avocado oil, organic sweet almond oil and organic aloe vera. These ingredients both hydrate and moisturize, and they have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties as well. And it's vegan, organic and cruelty-free and it's formulated without water, alcohol or silicone. It's also a great option for brightening, which is often a plus for dark skin tones. The ingredients work together to brighten the skin by offering antioxidant protection, anti-inflammatory properties, increased cell turnover, hydration and increased collagen production. There are no potentially irritating ingredients to lead to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.\u201d\n\nBest Vitamin C-infused skincare\n\nVitamin C, or L-ascorbic acid, is a substantial antioxidant that stimulates collagen production and fights UV damage and pigmentation \u2014 not to mention helps stave off colds. You can get your Vitamin C from certain foods \u2014 or you can wear it on your face.\n\n\u201cFormulation, packaging and storage are key here as it oxides quickly when exposed to light,\u201d Perkins said about what readers should keep in mind. Vitamin C can go from useable to dysfunction seemingly overnight.\n\nBoth Jagdeo and Palep recommended the C E Ferulic serum, which Jagdeo uses for both himself and his clients, and called \u201cthe hero product by which the rest of the cosmeceutical industry is measured.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an investment \u2014 one Palep said is worth it, as it remains active for multiple days and the included dropper keeps you using precisely how much you need to with little waste.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s packed with antioxidants that work great on darker skin tones for brightening and destroying free radicals,\u201d she added.\n\nKing recommends Schaf Revitalizing Serum, which was formulated specifically for dark spots and fine lines, making it a great fit for dark skin tones.\n\n\u201cVitamin C boosts brightness through its antioxidant properties, hyaluronic acid hydrates the skin, and peptides help stimulate collagen production to diminish fine lines,\u201d she said. It\u2019s also vegan and cruelty free.\n\nThe ultimate result everyone wants is one thing: Great skin. Skin care is self-care so treat yourself well.\n\nMore skincare shopping recommendations", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Amanda Mitchell"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan 16 21:55:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "You can find skincare products for dark skin with SPF, retinol, hyaluronic acid, Vitamin C and other ingredients at Ulta, Sephora, Walmart, Amazon, and elsewhere.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/best-skincare-ingredients-dark-skin-tone-n1116681", "title": "Best 17 skincare products for dark skin, according to dermatologists", "description": "People with dark skin could benefit from skincare especially formulated for their skin types.
