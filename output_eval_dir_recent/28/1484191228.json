No Lou Williams. No Terance Mann.\n\nYes, Derrick Walton Jr.\n\nThe 6-foot point guard from Michigan \u2014 via the Miami Heat, Chicago Bulls, Lithuanian club Zalgiris Kaunas and Germany\u2019s Alba Berlin \u2014 finished 2019 by further ingratiating himself with Clippers\u2019 fandom and his teammates alike.\n\nWalton, 24, chalked up a career-high 10 points on 4-of-5 shooting to buoy the short-handed Clippers on Tuesday in a convincing 105-87 victory over the Sacramento Kings.\n\n\u201cYessssir boyyy hooping,\u201d tweeted Beverley, who missed the first of what\u2019s expected to be a few games with a sprained right wrist.\n\nWalton was, indeed, hooping: He curled comfortably around a Montrezl Harrell screen and sank a jumper; he buried a wide-open rainbow 3-pointer from the top of the arc; he buried another in a defender\u2019s face; he recovered after being blocked by Bogdan Bogdanovic by popping up for another two points from the elbow \u2014 and looked exceedingly comfortable all the while.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just solid, he knows he can score, he knows he can shoot the ball,\u201d coach Doc Rivers told reporters in Sacramento who asked about Walton, who once scored 41 points in a G League game for the Sioux Falls Skyforce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the league doesn\u2019t know he can do that so they\u2019re going to keep leaving him open. He\u2019s not going to hesitate.\u201d\n\nWalton isn\u2019t the flinching type. During his televised postgame interview with Fox Sports\u2019 Kristina Pink, he answered a question about what he\u2019s looking forward to in the new year \u2014 which tips off for the Clippers (24-11) on Thursday against the 12-22 Detroit Pistons (7:30 p.m., Fox Sports Prime Ticket) and former Clippers star Blake Griffin, who\u2019s been nursing a sore knee.\n\n\u201cJust being a part of something special,\u201d Walton told Pink in response to her question. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing for something big. But you try to take it a day at a time\u2026\u201d\n\nAt that point, veteran forward Moe Harkless interrupted, draping a towel over Walton\u2019s head and giving the guard an affectionate noogie \u2014 which did not derail Walton\u2019s train of thought: \u201c\u2026 and know we got an end goal and just try to build blocks to make sure, at the end of the day, we\u2019re most prepared for what we\u2019re trying to get accomplished.\u201d\n\nBefore Walton was called up from Ontario to join the L.A. Clippers on Dec. 1, Walton was preparing for his current opportunity by stuffing stat sheets in the G League, with 13.4 points, 7.2 assists 6.4 rebounds and 1.4 steals in his five games with Agua Caliente.\n\nNow, in 17 contests with L.A., he\u2019s shooting an 55.6 percent from the field, 47.1 percent from 3-point range and is one of six regular Clippers with a positive \u2014 plus 1.2 \u2014 net plus-minus (the net point differential per 100 offensive and defensive possessions).\n\nJust before this season began, Walton offered a hint of what he believed he could contribute.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m always silently confident,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything about this situation is about fitting and opportunities.\u201d\n\nPISTONS AT CLIPPERSWhen: Thursday, 7:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Staples Center, Los Angeles\n\nTV: Fox Sports Prime Ticket", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Investigative Reporting", "Health", "Corrections", "Jobs"], "authors": ["Mirjam Swanson", "Mirjam Swanson Covers The Clippers", "The Nba", "The La Sparks For The Southern California News Group.
