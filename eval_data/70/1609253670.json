We\u2019ve been reporting this every Sunday by the way, from early on. You also said that you saw evidence,\u201d Bartiromo said.\n\n\u201cCan you tell us anything about the intelligence?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. No,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut we have a lot of information, and it\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you know the worst of all, whether it came from the lab or came from the bats, it all came from China, and they should have stopped it,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey could have stopped it at that source. I call it the source. Right there, it should have been stopped.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey made a decision to allow it to escape its borders?\u201d Bartiromo asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they made the decision, but it got out of control. I think more likely it got out of control,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWATCH:\n\nMultiple researchers have thrown cold water on the lab origin. Dr. Anthony Fauci has been highly skeptical of the idea that the virus came from a lab, saying that he is \u201cvery, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species,\u201d Fauci said earlier this month.\n\nJonna Mazet, an American researcher who worked at the lab in Wuhan at the center of these claims, cross-referenced the genetic information of the coronaviruses she worked with and determined that they didn\u2019t match COVID-19.
