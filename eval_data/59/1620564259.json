All four officers were fired from the police department Tuesday after video surfaced of Monday\u2019s arrest.\n\nTroops deployed\n\nThe announcement of charges came hours after hundreds of troops were deployed to the streets of Minneapolis and St. Paul to try to prevent a fourth night of violent protests.\n\nScores of buildings have been burned and looted across the so-called Twin Cities, including a police station associated with the four officers.\n\nMayor Jacob Frey declared a night-long curfew Friday and Saturday as protesters began to appear on the streets in Minneapolis and St. Paul again Friday afternoon.\n\nSome chanted \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2014 Floyd\u2019s words as Chauvin\u2019s knee pressed on his neck.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t care about this,\u201d said one African-American demonstrator, indicating the burned-out buildings.\n\n\u201cIf this is what it takes, we\u2019re willing to do more. You\u2019all were already killing us, when we weren\u2019t doing anything. \u2026 Let\u2019s hope it makes a change,\u201d he told AFP, without giving his name.\n\nPolice were out in force in other cities as protests took place in other cities including New York, Washington, Atlanta, Houston and Portland, hoping to prevent recurrences of the violence that hit Minneapolis.\n\nCharges criticized\n\nFloyd\u2019s family issued a statement acknowledging Chauvin\u2019s arrest, but calling the charges against him insufficient.\n\n\u201cWe want a first degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw and is spilling out onto streets across America.\u201d\n\nThe third degree charge though reflected the official autopsy saying that even though Chauvin held his knee to Floyd\u2019s neck for two minutes and 53 seconds after he became \u201cnon-responsive,\u201d Floyd did not die of asphyxiation or strangulation.\n\n\u201cMr. Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease,\u201d the charging document said.\n\n\u201cThe combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions, and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.\u201d\n\n\u2018This shouldn\u2019t be normal\u2019\n\nAfter beginning the day attacking the protesters as \u201cthugs\u201d and threatening to send in federal troops to deal harshly with them, Trump shifted tone later on Friday, announcing he had called Floyd\u2019s family to express his \u201csorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand the hurt, I understand the pain. People have really been through a lot. The family of George is entitled to justice and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer president Barack Obama said in a statement that he shared the \u201canguish\u201d of millions of Americans over Floyd\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cWe have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly \u2018normal\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be \u2018normal\u2019 in 2020 America.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s former vice president Joe Biden, who is running for president, also spoke to Floyd\u2019s family.\n\nHe called for justice and said it was time to heal the \u201copen wound\u201d of systemic racism in the United States.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Derek Chauvin", "George Floyd"], "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "publish_date": "Sat May 30 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Minneapolis police officer accused of killing a handcuffed African American man was charged with murder Friday as authorities declared a curfew after three nights of violent protests left parts of the city in flames.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://tribune.net.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cropped-LOGO-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://tribune.net.ph/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/us-pulis.jpg", "secure_url": "https://tribune.net.ph/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/us-pulis.jpg", "width": 768, "height": 511}, "url": "https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/05/30/us-cop-charged-with-murder-over-unarmed-black-mans-death/", "title": "US cop charged with murder over unarmed black man's death | World | Daily Tribune", "description": "The Minneapolis police officer accused of killing a handcuffed African American man was charged with murder Friday as authorities declared a curfew after three nights of violent protests left parts of the city in flames.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Daily Tribune"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://tribune.net.ph/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/us-pulis.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/05/30/us-cop-charged-with-murder-over-unarmed-black-mans-death/", "title": "US cop charged with murder over unarmed black man's death | World | Daily Tribune", "description": "The Minneapolis police officer accused of killing a handcuffed African American man was charged with murder Friday as authorities declared a curfew after three nights of violent protests left parts of the city in flames.", "site": "@tribunephl", "creator": "@tribunephl"}, "description": "The Minneapolis police officer accused of killing a handcuffed African American man was charged with murder Friday as authorities declared a curfew after three nights of violent protests left parts of the city in flames.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tribunephl", "tag": "George Floyd", "section": "World", "published_time": "2020-05-30T00:27:17+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 243577083080520, "pages": 2056657031212662}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.7", "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/05/30/us-cop-charged-with-murder-over-unarmed-black-mans-death/?ia_markup=1"}, "google-site-verification": "vziAmCQoJSUIH98s8vZMphJfn_SRQXVfDxvc7wz-4KI", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://tribune.net.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cropped-LOGO-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/05/30/us-cop-charged-with-murder-over-unarmed-black-mans-death/"}
