Dr Adrian Zenz\n\nThe records of a 65-year-old man held in \"continued training\", Yusup, shows two daughters who \"wore veils and burkas in 2014 and 2015\", a son with Islamic political leanings and a family that displays \"obvious anti-Han sentiment\".\n\nMost individuals listed have relatives currently living overseas - a category seen as disloyal.\n\nLeading world expert on China's policies in Xinjiang, Dr Adrian Zenz, said: \"This remarkable document presents the strongest evidence I've seen to date that Beijing is actively persecuting and punishing normal practices of traditional religious beliefs.\"\n\nHe believes the document exposes the \"ideological and administrative micromechanics\" of the camps.\n\nSpeaking to CNN he said: \u201cThe contents of this document are really significant to all of us because it shows us the paranoid mindset of a regime that\u2019s controlling the up-and-coming super power of this globe\".\n\n\n\nCHINA'S DENIAL\n\nChina denies any wrongdoing, saying it is combating terrorism and religious extremism and that the camps are merely re-education schools.\n\nThe government has claimed it is running a mass deradicalization program targeting potential extremists.\n\nFrom 2017, groups of Communist Party workers have examined Uighur households, taking detailed notes about the \"religious atmosphere\" in the homes, how many Korans they had or whether religious rites were observed.\n\nAnd since 2016, the Chinese government has been thought to have been operating fortified camps to detain its Uyghur citizens.\n\nHowever, on Thursday Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said: \u201c(Those who have come) have not seen any concentration camps or persecution in Xinjiang.\n\n\"However, what they have seen is that all ethnic groups are able to live peacefully and harmoniously \u2026 Their religious freedom is totally protected and they can practice their religion without any restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe so-called concentration camps with so-called 1 million people are 100 per cent rumors. It is completely fake news.\n\n\"I do not understand why these people are still lying while having the facts. I can only say that these people are deeply prejudiced against China.\u201d\n\nSTATE SURVEILLANCE\n\nThe leaked document exposes what seems to be a state surveillance in the region, targeting those who practice their culture or religion.\n\nThis is the third major leak of sensitive Chinese government documents showing a potential sinister program designed to \"promote ethnic unity\".\n\nMOST READ IN NEWS BATTLE ROYAL Queen orders investigation into claims Meghan bullied staff in shock move Exclusive OUT OF FASHION Meghan \u2018had furious rows with Palace aides over freebie designer clothes\u2019 FEELING LUCKY?
