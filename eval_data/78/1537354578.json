As rightly held in that decision, there can be no exhaustive or general exposition of circumstances in which an applicant may be held entitled to approach the high court directly.\"The bench further said that the special circumstances must be left for the consideration of the judge before whom the petition is placed and a decision thereon taken bearing in mind the facts and circumstances of that particular cause.\n\n\"However, special circumstances must necessarily exist and be established as such before the jurisdiction of the high court is invoked,\" it said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Criminal law", "Crime", "Law enforcement", "Anticipatory bail", "Bail", "Arrest", "Chief Justice", "single judge", "Allahabad High Court", "Yashwant Verma", "Vinod Kumar", "judge", "Govind Mathur", "Ramesh Sinha", "Rahul Chaturvedi", "Sunita Agarwal"], "tags": ["#OilPrice", "Law Crime"], "authors": ["Press Trust Of India"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Read more about Under special circumstances, one can directly approach HC for anticipatory bail: Allahabad HC on Business Standard.
