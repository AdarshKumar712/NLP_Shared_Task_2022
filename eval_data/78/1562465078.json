LATAM Airlines said earlier this month it would halve the salaries of its 43,000 employees.\n\nThe airline said that affected passengers will be able to reschedule their trips up until the end of the year at no extra cost and that the value of tickets would be automatically held as credit for future journeys.\n\n(Reporting by Natalia Ramos; Writing by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Get the latest news and updates on the COVID-19 pandemic Read More \u2192"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sun Mar 29 18:29:53 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "SANTIAGO \u2014 LATAM Airlines, Latin America\u2019s largest carrier, said on Sunday that it will suspend further international routes until the end of April due to travel restrictions and lower demand amid a global coronavirus pandemic.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/b4ece3189893389a03f063830eacd95c?s=32", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive", "description": "SANTIAGO &mdash; LATAM Airlines, Latin America&rsquo;s largest carrier, said on Sunday that it will suspend further international routes until the end of April due to travel restrictions and lower demand amid a global coronavirus pandemic.", "news_keywords": "reu", "google-site-verification": "ZoJuT_r2C_ObFF9DTmGO1Y81ICCu6AF7PFSmFc25uaM", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "LATAM Airlines cuts more flights as virus spreads", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/latam-airlines-cuts-more-flights-as-virus-spreads", "description": "SANTIAGO \u2014 LATAM Airlines, Latin America\u2019s largest carrier, said on Sunday that it will suspend further international routes until the end of April due to travel restrictions and lower \u2026", "site_name": "Financial Post", "image": {"identifier": "https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/b4ece3189893389a03f063830eacd95c?s=200&ts=1585584707", "width": 200, "height": 200}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-29T18:29:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-29T18:29:59+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/financialpost"}, "twitter": {"site": "@financialpost", "text": {"title": "LATAM Airlines cuts more flights as virus spreads"}, "image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/fp-512x512.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "LATAM Airlines cuts more flights as virus spreads", "description": "SANTIAGO \u2014 LATAM Airlines, Latin America\u2019s largest carrier, said on Sunday that it will suspend further international routes until the end of April due to travel restrictions and lower demand amid a global coronavirus pandemic."}, "stats-full-init": "0.012", "stats-postmedia_theme_pre_initialize": "0.001", "stats-initialize": "0.011", "stats-postmedia_theme_post_initialize": "0.000", "stats-vip_load_plugins": "0.002", "stats-load_plugins": "0.007", "stats-register_widgets": "0.001", "fb": {"pages": 48139565306, "app_id": 138801856165024, "page_id": 168282878593, "admins": 100002625504753}, "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "vf": {"unique_id": "046dea96-309a-4a14-a69e-6561cb005113"}, "application-name": "Financial Post", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Canada Business News | Financial Updates & Information", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://business.financialpost.com/feed;icon-uri=https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/b4ece3189893389a03f063830eacd95c?s=16"}, "canonical_link": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/latam-airlines-cuts-more-flights-as-virus-spreads"}
