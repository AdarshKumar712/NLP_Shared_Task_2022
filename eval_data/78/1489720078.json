Together with left-wing party Podemos, he will lead the first coalition government in the country\u2019s history since the Second Republic in the 30s.\n\nS\u00e1nchez faces a difficult mandate ahead, as the liberals, centre-right and far-right parties offered staunch opposition during the parliament debate forcing him to rely on the Catalan pro-independence party and Basque separatists to pass the vote.\n\nS\u00e1nchez said he would prioritise addressing the territorial conflict and fighting against the long-lasting consequences of the economic crisis in the country, still suffering from high levels of debt and unemployment.\n\nBut his government will struggle to pass the necessary reforms in education or the labour market, as he would need the centre-right PP to obtain a strong majority.\n\nEven so, the end of the political paralysis in Spain, where four general elections have been held over the past four years, was welcomed by the EU institutions.\n\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel congratulated S\u00e1nchez on his reelection.\n\n\u201cThis is good news for the EU. Let\u2019s build a greener and fairer Europe together,\u201d he tweeted. A similar message was conveyed by European Commission and European Parliament presidents, Ursula von der Leyen and David Sassoli.\n\nRead also: Allied with far-left, Spain\u2019s Sanchez stays on as PM", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  8 08:38:43 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/themes/euractiv_com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "wp-parsely_version": "2.0", "robots": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot-news": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "MADRID - S\u00e1nchez re-elected in tight vote"}, "og": {"title": "MADRID - S\u00e1nchez re-elected in tight vote", "url": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/madrid-sanchez-re-elected-in-tight-vote/", "type": "article", "site_name": "www.euractiv.com", "image": {"alt": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/madrid-sanchez-re-elected-in-tight-vote/"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-08 08:38:43", "author": "Jorge Valero"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/ea_favicon_16x16.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/madrid-sanchez-re-elected-in-tight-vote/"}
