The tweak takes the dominant color from the application icon in the banner notification and then applies it to the banner itself. For example, the Facebook notification banner appears dark blue, while the YouTube notification banner appears red and the Snapchat notification banner appears yellow. The list goes on\u2026\n\nColorfulNotifs doesn\u2019t have any options to configure because the tweak handles its color selections automatically. If you would ever want to revert to native notification colors, then you\u2019d need to uninstall the tweak from your device.\n\nThose interested in trying ColorfulNotifs can download the tweak for free from the Packix repository via their preferred package manager. The tweak supports all jailbroken iOS 13 devices.\n\nWill you be making your notifications more colorful with ColorfulNotifs?
