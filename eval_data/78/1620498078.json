We must have transparency. Why is it that China shut off infected people from Wuhan to all other parts of China?\u201d he continued. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go to Beijing, it went nowhere else, but they allowed them to freely travel throughout the world, including Europe and the United States.\u201d\n\nAdvertisements\n\nThe president\u2019s announcement comes as the death toll from the novel coronavirus in the United States tops 104,000. He had repeatedly threatened to cut ties with WHO in recent weeks as the pandemic tore its way through the nation.\n\nThe decision was met with heated criticism.\n\nTrump is so mad about Chinese influence at the WHO that he's going to dramatically increase Chinese influence at the WHO. Makes a lot of sense in the middle of a pandemic that requires global cooperation. \u2014 Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) May 29, 2020\n\nTrump said \u201cThe world needs answers from China on the virus.\u201d We\u2019re less likely to get answers on anything (or viral samples for research), if we\u2019re not a @WHO\u2069 member.

TB? https://t.co/ClyWcRnW54 \u2014 Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) May 29, 2020\n\nThis is a phenomenal mistake, not only for the world, but for American self-interest and national security.\n\nWithdrawing from @WHO \u2014 especially in the middle of a #pandemic \u2014 is self-destructive. There is no alternative global health presence.https://t.co/KxqxcF7XF0 \u2014 Laurie Garrett (@Laurie_Garrett) May 29, 2020\n\nThe president further claimed that the WHO \u201cfailed to make the requested greatly needed reform\u201d and the U.S. \u201cwill be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Coronavirus", "Donald Trump", "World Health Organization"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://2vwlfu3ynqxb3npfhm3m8lde-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Politicususa_Favicon_32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Trump Announces U.S. Will Sever Ties with WHO as Coronavirus Deaths Top 104,000", "description": "Advertisements President Donald Trump announced earlier today that the United States will sever ties with the World Health Organization (WHO) during his press conference earlier today. \u201cChina has total control over the World Health Organization despite only paying $40 million per year compared to what the United States has been paying, which is approximately $450 \u2026 Continue reading \"Trump Announces U.S. Will Sever Ties with WHO as Coronavirus Deaths Top 104,000\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.politicususa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2020-05-14T202137Z_1483108146_RC2KOG96Q9YA_RTRMADP_3_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-USA-scaled.jpg", "width": 2560, "height": 1636}, "url": "https://www.politicususa.com/2020/05/29/trump-announces-u-s-will-sever-ties-with-who-as-coronavirus-deaths-top-104000.html", "site_name": "POLITICUSUSA", "updated_time": "2020-05-29T18:08:52-04:00", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA/", "published_time": "2020-05-29T22:08:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-05-29T18:08:52-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Trump Announces U.S. Will Sever Ties with WHO as Coronavirus Deaths Top 104,000", "description": "President Donald Trump announced earlier today that the United States will sever ties with the World Health Organization (WHO) during his press conference earlier today.    \u201cChina has total control over the World Health Organization despite only", "image": "https://www.politicususa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2020-05-14T202137Z_1483108146_RC2KOG96Q9YA_RTRMADP_3_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-USA-scaled.jpg", "site": "@politicususa", "creator": "@politicususa", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Alan Ryland", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "generator": "AMP for WP 1.0.71.2", "facebook-domain-verification": "3zbqd9lb63tm12bk0xgp070etr55vh", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.politicususa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Politicususa_Favicon_32x32.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.politicususa.com/2020/05/29/trump-announces-u-s-will-sever-ties-with-who-as-coronavirus-deaths-top-104000.html"}
