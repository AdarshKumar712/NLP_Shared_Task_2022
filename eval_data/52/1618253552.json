He was 84.\n\nKramer was an American playwright, screenwriter and gay rights pioneer and is widely credited with catalyzing the early response to the HIV/AIDS crisis in the United States.\n\nPortrait of American author, AIDS campaigner and gay rights activist Larry Kramer, founder of ACT-UP and the Gay Men's Health Crisis group, posing in front of a book shelf in his home. Sara Krulwich / Getty Images\n\nBorn in 1935, he grew up in and around Washington, D.C. He graduated from Yale University in 1957 and served in the U.S. Army Reserve, before working in film production in London for Columbia Pictures.\n\nIn August 1981, following the announcement of an outbreak of Kaposi sarcoma, Kramer formed a group that eventually became the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis, the first AIDS service organization in the world. Later, in 1987, fed up with federal government inaction, he and other activists formed ACT UP \u2014 The AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power \u2014 a radical AIDS organization that staged dramatic protests and public interventions for years to force officials to spend more money and include more activists in AIDS research.\n\nKramer\u2019s career as a playwright earned him wide accolades for the off-Broadway play \u201cThe Normal Heart,\u201d a semi-autobiographical reflection on the immense human toll of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The play was later made into a HBO miniseries and revived on Broadway. In 1996, Kramer received the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award for Literature.\n\nHe was also a prolific author of novels, writing one book \u2014 \u201cFaggots,\u201d first published in 1978 \u2014 that provoked polarized reactions from the New York City gay communities it shone an unflattering light on.\n\nKramer married his partner, architect David Webster, in a 2013 ceremony. Kramer survived a liver transplant, abdominal surgery and over three decades of HIV infection.\n\nFollowing news of his death, ACT UP shared a message for their fallen AIDS warrior.\n\nRest in power to our fighter Larry Kramer. Your rage helped inspire a movement. We will keep honoring your name and spirit with action.
