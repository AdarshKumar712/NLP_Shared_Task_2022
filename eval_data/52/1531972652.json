Below is an excerpt from the article.\n\nThe evidence abounds: A \"Medicare for All\" single-payer system would guarantee comprehensive coverage to everyone in America and save money.\n\nChristopher Cai and colleagues at three University of California campuses examined 22 studies on the projected cost impact for single-payer health insurance in the United States and reported their findings in a recent paper in PLOS Medicine. Every single study predicted that it would yield net savings over several years. In fact, it\u2019s the only way to rein in health care spending significantly in the U.S.\n\nAll of the studies, regardless of ideological orientation, showed that long-term cost savings were likely. Even the Mercatus Center, a right-wing think tank, recently found about $2 trillion in net savings over 10 years from a single-payer Medicare for All system. Most importantly, everyone in America would have high-quality health care coverage.\n\nMedicare for All is far less costly than our current system largely because it reduces administrative costs. With one public plan negotiating rates with health care providers, billing becomes quite simple. We do away with three-quarters of the estimated $812 billion the U.S. now spends on health care administration.\n\nAdministrative costs are so high because thousands of insurance companies individually negotiate benefit rules and rates with thousands of hospitals and doctors. On top of that, they rely on different billing procedures \u2014 and this puts a costly burden on providers.\n\nRead more...", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["22 studies agree: 'Medicare for All' saves money"], "tags": ["TRUMP", "CORONAVIRUS", "SPYGATE", "SANDERS", "BREAKING", "BIDEN"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Whether you call it single-payer or", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "22 studies agree: 'Medicare for All' saves money", "description": "Whether you call it single-payer or", "google-site-verification": "tFwban02zfqaKeK05Mkgz89TdOounWhx71cOQcw8qKY", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "noodp", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "22 studies agree: 'Medicare for All' saves money", "description": "Whether you call it single-payer or 'Medicare for All,' it isn't some socialist pipe dream.
