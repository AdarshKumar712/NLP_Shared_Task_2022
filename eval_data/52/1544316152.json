But, he added, \"if tomorrow or the day after there was a reason\" to take more drastic measures, \"we would take them\".\n\nMacron said that taking \"disproportionate measures\" when France was \"only at the beginning of the crisis\" would be \"counterproductive\".\n\nThe French leader emphasised that it was \"much more effective\" to take containment measures in affected regions. Italy recorded its deadliest day of the virus outbreak on Tuesday, its toll rising by 168 to 631, with a total of 10,149 infected.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Macron", "Emmanuel", "Emmanuel Macron", "Humans", "Politicians", "Politics by country", "President", "Austria", "Slovenia", "China", "European Union", "France", "Italy"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Read more about Macron says closing borders with Italy 'a bad decision' on Business Standard.
