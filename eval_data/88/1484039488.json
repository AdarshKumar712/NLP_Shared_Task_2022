(AP Photo/John Locher)\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 The Ducks didn\u2019t have a chance Tuesday afternoon because they didn\u2019t give themselves a chance. They tossed the puck around like it was toxic and paid the price for their carelessness with a 5-2 loss to the opportunistic Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.\n\nThe Golden Knights jumped the Ducks from the start, and it wasn\u2019t as if they needed help to build a commanding lead. But the Ducks gave it to them anyway, sandwiching two egregious turnovers around an own goal as Vegas skated away with a 3-1 advantage entering the third period.\n\nFunny thing, too.\n\nThe Ducks actually weathered an early Vegas onslaught to take a 1-0 lead on defenseman Korbinian Holzer\u2019s first goal of the season, a chip shot that found the back of the net 8:13 into the game. It was more or less, all downhill from there for the Ducks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating when we come out and we\u2019re not ready to play,\u201d Ducks goaltender John Gibson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to play in the National Hockey League and it feels like some guys are starting to take it for granted and are just kind of happy to be here. We play a good game every now and then and we can\u2019t string it together, put two in a row, can\u2019t seem to get points.\u201d\n\nGibson turned away the Golden Knights again and again, but he was left to fend for himself far too often. Vegas outshot the Ducks by 43-28, including 22-5 in the first period.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to be more consistent in our game,\u201d Holzer said. \u201cThere are stretches in the game where we play really well and there are stretches where we play absolutely terrible. We can\u2019t have \u2018Gibby\u2019 bail us out every night. It\u2019s not the way we should play. It\u2019s not a recipe for success.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the opening period unfolded in a nightmarish fashion of the Ducks\u2019 own making.\n\nDucks defenseman Erik Gudbranson lost control of the puck in front of his net. Mark Stone, who separated Sam Steel from the puck a nanosecond earlier, jumped on Gudbranson\u2019s misplay and beat Ducks goaltender Gibson for the tying goal at 14:36 of the first period.\n\nVegas then made it 2-1 in the closing seconds of the opening period. Or rather the Ducks did. Alex Tuch was credited with the tiebreaking goal at 19:40, when he swatted a loose puck beneath Gibson. The puck kept moving and then Ducks defenseman Josh Manson tapped it into his own net.\n\nThe Ducks complained that a whistle should have halted play, but to no avail. Gibson later said he watched the replay during the intermission and admitted the call was correct. He even skated out and spoke to referee Dean Morton before the second period began.\n\nRelated Articles Ducks goalie John Gibson credits break with improved play\n\nDucks right wing Jakob Silfverberg picked to play in All-Star Game\n\nDucks goalie John Gibson bemoans inconsistent play in OT loss to Flyers\n\nDucks captain Ryan Getzlaf finding new ways to lead\n\nDucks ride second-period flurry to victory over Golden Knights \u201cIt was just kind of sitting there,\u201d Gibson said of the loose puck that ended up squirting free before Manson mishandled it. \u201cI think Manson went to grab it and it went into the net. I was upset with it and then I looked at it and (Morton) made the right call.\u201d\n\nLate in the second period, after the Ducks had pushed back and actually began to generate sustained pressure in the Golden Knights\u2019 end, disaster struck again. Adam Henrique\u2019s clearing attempt sailed directly onto the stick of Vegas\u2019 Reilly Smith, who beat Gibson for a 3-1 lead at 17:55.\n\nIn the third, Jonathan Marchessault scored twice, including on a penalty shot that extended the Vegas lead to 4-1. Jakob Silfverberg\u2019s team-leading 14th goal cut the Ducks\u2019 deficit to 4-2, but Marchessault sealed it with an empty-net goal with 1:54 left.\n\n\u201cIt would be one thing if we had shown all year that we weren\u2019t able to play with teams like this, but we have shown that we can,\u201d Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. \u201cThat\u2019s where you kind of (hurt) yourself. It\u2019s like if you go out and run a four-minute mile and you show up every day after that and you run a seven-minute mile. Something\u2019s wrong because you showed you could do it.\u201d\n\n'Get that mentality that every night is going to be a hard working night, bear down, and hopefully we can string some games together'.
