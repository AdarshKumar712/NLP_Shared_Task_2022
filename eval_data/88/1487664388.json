Morales face charges of sedition and funding terrorism in his homeland, while the interim government that replaced him in power in La Paz has accused the indigenous leader of \u201cusurping [the] functions\u201d of public office.\n\nMorales also revealed that he had received legal advice from the famed Spanish judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n.\n\nZaffaroni, a judge sitting on the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR), said he would excuse himself from any case involving that jurisdiction.\n\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE\n\nEarlier in the week, Morales said that the presidential candidate for his Movement for Socialism (MAS) party in next year\u2019s Bolivian elections would be named January 19. He has previously said MAS leaders would hold a summit at an as-yet unidentified location on the ArgentineBolivian border to make the decision.\n\nThe 60-year-old, who spent almost 14 years in power, resigned the presidency after two weeks of protests, following election results that were questioned by the opposition and the Organisation of American States (OAS). The Police and Armed Forces withdrew their support.\n\nConservative leader Jeanine A\u00f1ez subsequently took office as the nation\u2019s interim leader and said Bolivia would hold new elections, though no date has yet been since. She has said Morales will be banned from running.\n\nRecently, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal of Bolivia announced that \u201cfor logistical reasons\u201d there will be no registration of new overseas voters for the upcoming elections. That means, in essence, that Morales would have to go to Bolivia to vote. He has yet to confirm whether he will do so or not.\n\nAmong the likely presidential candidates are MAS leaders Andronico Rodr\u00edguez (seen as Morales\u2019 political heir), former foreign ministers Diego Pary and David Choquehuanca and execonomy minister Luis Arce. Likely opponents include ex-president Carlos Mesa and Luis Fernando Camacho and Marco Antonio Pumari, both seen as figures who were influential in pushing for Morales\u2019 resignation.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Jan  4 08:18:06 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Ex-Bolivia leader says that the presidential candidate for his Movement for Socialism (MAS) party in next year\u2019s Bolivian elections would be named January 19.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.batimes.com.ar/img/favicon/apple-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "description": "Ex-Bolivia leader says that the presidential candidate for his Movement for Socialism (MAS) party in next year\u2019s Bolivian elections would be named January 19.", "ads-load": 1, "ads-sec": "articulo", "ads-client": "212f2", "fb": {"pages": 346660759103097, "admins": "100000796672456,1483151046,1411317735", "app_id": 171058600109657}, "analytics-path-name": "/sitios/batimes", "analytics-client-id": "UA-4879118-1", "analytics-view": "news.show", "analytics-data": "{\"slug\":\"zaffaroni-and-ferreyra-to-act-as-legal-advisors-to-evo-morales\",\"section\":\"sitios.batimes.nota\",\"author\":\"Eugenia Iglesias\",\"date\":\"January, 04 2020 08:18:06 -0300\",\"id\":481604}", "comscore-client-id": 6906401, "google-site-verification": "Jg0lBfG_8wkinE66AODrFPC55pceDoLGemlA_Pim2Rw", "latam-analytics-client-id": "UA-155177894-1", "latam-analytics-path-name": "/ar/batimes", "latam-analytics-sample-rate": 100, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "last-render": "19-02-00 00:41:06", "og": {"url": "https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/argentina/zaffaroni-and-ferreyra-to-act-as-legal-advisors-to-evo-morales.phtml", "type": "article", "locale": "en_EN", "site_name": "Buenos Aires Times", "title": "Zaffaroni and Ferreyra to act as legal advisors to Evo Morales", "description": "Ex-Bolivia leader says that the presidential candidate for his Movement for Socialism (MAS) party in next year\u2019s Bolivian elections would be named January 19.", "updated_time": "2020-01-11T11:14:30-03:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://fotos.perfil.com/2020/01/04/trim/1140/641/0401-evo-846885.jpg", "secure_url": "https://fotos.perfil.com/2020/01/04/trim/1140/641/0401-evo-846885.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1140, "height": 641, "alt": "Former president of Bolivia, Evo Morales."}}, "article": {"section": "argentina", "published_time": "2020-01-04T08:18:06-03:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-11T11:14:30-03:00", "tag": "legal"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theBAtimes", "creator": "@theBAtimes", "title": "Zaffaroni and Ferreyra to act as legal advisors to Evo Morales", "description": "Ex-Bolivia leader says that the presidential candidate for his Movement for Socialism (MAS) party in next year\u2019s Bolivian elections would be named January 19.", "image": {"identifier": "https://fotos.perfil.com/2020/01/04/trim/1140/641/0401-evo-846885.jpg", "alt": "Former president of Bolivia, Evo Morales."}}, "editoria": "Buenos Aires Times", "dtnoticia": "2020-01-04T08:18:06-03:00", "title": "Buenos Aires Times | Zaffaroni and Ferreyra to act as legal advisors to Evo Morales", "news_keywords": "evo,morales,zaffaroni,legal", "news_channel": "argentina", "news_hat": "EVO IN ARGENTINA", "hedline": "Ex-Bolivia leader says that the presidential candidate for his Movement for Socialism (MAS) party in next year\u2019s Bolivian elections would be named January 19.", "url": "https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/argentina/zaffaroni-and-ferreyra-to-act-as-legal-advisors-to-evo-morales.phtml", "datePublished": "2020-01-04T08:18:06-03:00"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/argentina/zaffaroni-and-ferreyra-to-act-as-legal-advisors-to-evo-morales.phtml"}
