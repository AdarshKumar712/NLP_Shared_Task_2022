Encouragingly, research points to positive outcomes for older people using technology for social connection, including improved health and reduced loneliness. There are barriers to the widespread adoption of these technologies\u2014but also promising solutions. For those with physical or cognitive difficulties, a program in Barcelona has made tablets with a very simple to use app to connect those with physical or cognitive difficulties with a network of friends and service providers. Enhanced public efforts are needed to expand such initiatives to reach the needed scale. Another barrier is access to the broadband networks needed for these technologies to be effective. An analysis by the Pew Research Center shows that those over age 65 are less likely than others to have access to broadband, as are racial minorities and those living in rural areas. Investments in expanding broadband access are needed to assure that this resource is available to the vast majority of older adults.\n\nTechnology can also help connect isolated older adults with health-care providers. The pandemic has led to the rapid adoption of telemedicine (including teletherapy) to enable health-care providers to maintain physical distance while treating patients. As with the use of technology to maintain social connections, the pandemic may provide greater experience and comfort with these approaches that will be helpful for their more widescale adoption in coming years. Still, expanded technological infrastructure, training for providers in virtual care, and education of patients will all be needed. Rules and regulations governing when, by whom, and at what reimbursement level telemedicine can be used will also need revision; many existing restrictions have been waived during the pandemic, which may provide valuable lessons for regulatory changes going forward. Of course, inequality in broadband access is an issue here as well.\n\nFinally, there are also lessons about the importance of the built environment in supporting opportunities for physical activity. With athletic facilities closed, people of all ages are heading outdoors to walk, run, and bike while maintaining physical distance. But for older adults (particularly those living in low-density areas without safe sidewalks and road intersections), even walking outdoors comes with risks. The age-friendly communities movement aims to involve state and local leaders in efforts to adapt the physical environment to ensure that older adults can age actively and participate fully in society.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been catastrophic in so many ways, not least for older people. But we may yet benefit in the long run from this experience if we heed the lessons of this stress test to take steps to minimize the isolation of our oldest citizens.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "How can we learn from this experience and better prepare for an aging society?", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/sites/default/files/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Pandemic is Stress Testing Aging in Place", "description": "How can we learn from this experience and better prepare for an aging society?", "site": "@MilkenInstitute", "image": "https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/Herbert-Molinsky_Hero%20Image-min.jpg"}, "description": "How can we learn from this experience and better prepare for an aging society?", "og": {"title": "The Pandemic is Stress Testing Aging in Place", "description": "How can we learn from this experience and better prepare for an aging society?", "image": {"identifier": "https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/Herbert-Molinsky_Hero%20Image-min.jpg", "url": "https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/Herbert-Molinsky_Hero%20Image-min.jpg", "secure_url": "https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/Herbert-Molinsky_Hero%20Image-min.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/milkeninstitute/"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "https://milkeninstitute.org/power-of-ideas/pandemic-stress-testing-aging-place"}
