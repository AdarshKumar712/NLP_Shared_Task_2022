resume in California as early as June 12, according to officials in the state that has approved new safety protocols to be followed on sets to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe entertainment industry has been shut down for about three months now that has crippled the industry.\n\nCalifornia Department of Public Health said on Friday that Hollywood productions will have to get approval from local health officials to resume filming within the jurisdictions of operations for their review.\n\nThe authorities said film industry workers, including actors, technicians as well as other crew members, will have to follow new safety protocols \u201cto reduce the risk for infection\u201d.\n\nThe reopening from June 12 will apply to film, television, and music video production.\n\n\u201cMusic, TV and film production may resume in California, recommended no sooner than June 12, 2020, and subject to approval by county public health officers within the jurisdictions of operations following their review of local epidemiological data including cases per 100,000 population, rate of test positivity, and local preparedness to support a health care surge, vulnerable populations, contact tracing and testing,\u201d the department said.\n\n\u201cTo reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission, productions, cast, crew and other industry workers should abide by safety protocols agreed by labor and management, which may be further enhanced by county public health officers.\u201d\n\nIt said that the back office staff and management should adhere to office workspace guidelines published by the California Department of Public Health and the California Department of Industrial Relations.\n\nAwaiting the announcement of California Governor Gavin Newsom on safety protocol for production, the industry earlier this week revealed its proposal to return to sets safely.\n\nMajor film and television unions and big studios have endorsed the plan.\n\nChecking the temperature of the employees, eliminating buffet-style food catering, making it compulsory for the live audience to wear masks, and limit the number of team members on the sets are some of the new guidelines for resuming filming safely.\n\nThe health crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic had devastating consequences on Hollywood, which was compelled to suspend all its shootings, including, among others, the sequels of blockbusters like \u201cAvatar\u201d, \u201cMission: Impossible 7\u201d, \u201cJurassic World: Dominion\u201d, \u201cThe Batman\u201d, and \u201cThe Matrix\u201d.\n\nMovie theaters were also affected with the complete closure of the cinema that led to delay in the release of films such as \u201cNo Time to Die,\u201d (James Bond), \u201cF9\u201d (Fast & Furious), \u201cMulan\u201d, \u201cBlack Widow\u201d, \u201cWonder Woman 1984\u201d, \u201cGhostbusters: Afterlife\u201d, \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d, and \u201cSoul\u201d.EFE-EPA\n\ndvp/sk/ssk", "keywords":
