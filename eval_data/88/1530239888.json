She did not identify Hughes.\n\n\"A man was pronounced deceased after the rocket crashed in the open desert during a rocket launch event,\" she said.\n\nSheriff's aviation investigators were looking into the accident.\n\nIn a statement last year, Discovery, Inc. described the forthcoming show as a look at \"three self-financed teams with sky-high dreams, in their cosmic quest to explore the final frontier on shoe-string budgets.\"\n\nHughes' stunt Saturday was billed as part of a plan to raise money for another project, a planned launch to the border of space on a vehicle described as part rocket, part balloon, Discovery said.\n\nThe money-raising launch had a goal of reaching 5,000 feet into the sky aboard a \"steam-powered rocket,\" the broadcaster said.\n\nHughes is known both for his homemade rockets and for his belief the earth is flat.\n\nHis desire to prove the planet is \"shaped like a Frisbee\" inspired his vertical endeavors, he has said. But Saturday's launch did not appear to be directly tied to Hughes' flat-earth argument.\n\nIn 2018, he successfully launched himself about 1,875 feet into the sky above the Mojave desert via a garage-made rocket.\n\nHis landing that year was softened when he deployed a parachute. In social media video of Saturday's accident, a parachute-like swath of fabric can be seen flying away from the rocket shortly after blast-off.\n\n\"This thing wants to kill you 10 different ways,\" Hughes said in 2018. \"This thing will kill you in a heartbeat.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Dennis Romero", "Linda Takahashi"], "publish_date": "Sun Feb 23 05:10:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "He was working on a TV show, \"Homemade Astronauts,\" when his craft crashed in the California desert.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "He was working on a TV show, \"Homemade Astronauts,\" when his craft crashed in the California desert.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hDlJzC5pCmyqsIesoYgf3Q--~B/aD0xNjY3O3c9MjUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/nbc_news_122/19787108b1449426db50bde732c6dd0d", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hDlJzC5pCmyqsIesoYgf3Q--~B/aD0xNjY3O3c9MjUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/nbc_news_122/19787108b1449426db50bde732c6dd0d"}, "title": "Daredevil 'Mad' Mike Hughes dies in homemade rocket launch"}, "application-name": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines", "news_keywords": "rocket launch, Science Channel", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=6b66fda9-4999-306a-93f2-91d1df4f2ec7&src=web", "description": "He was working on a TV show, \"Homemade Astronauts,\" when his craft crashed in the California desert.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hDlJzC5pCmyqsIesoYgf3Q--~B/aD0xNjY3O3c9MjUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/nbc_news_122/19787108b1449426db50bde732c6dd0d", "description": "He was working on a TV show, \"Homemade Astronauts,\" when his craft crashed in the California desert.", "title": "Daredevil 'Mad' Mike Hughes dies in homemade rocket launch", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/daredevil-mad-mike-hughes-dies-051000808.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 338028696036, "app_id": 458584288257241}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=6b66fda9-4999-306a-93f2-91d1df4f2ec7&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=6b66fda9-4999-306a-93f2-91d1df4f2ec7&src=web"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://news.yahoo.com/daredevil-mad-mike-hughes-dies-051000808.html"}
