Both are key leaders in the Mercosur, with Brasilia wanting the regional trade bloc to undergo a shake-up, with Bolsonaro believed to be eyeing a reduction in tariffs.\n\nSol\u00e1, speaking at a press conference Thursday, said he had told Brazilian officials that Buenos Aires understood \u201cthat Mercosur must be renewed.\u201d\n\nThe meeting between the foreign minister and Bolsonaro was described as \u201cwarm\u201d by Foreign Ministry sources, who interpreted its success as a sign ties were improving.\n\nArgentina\u2019s next ambassador to Brazil, Daniel Scioli, who also attended the meeting said the \u201cfirst stage of work\u201d was underway, saying \u201cspecific points\u201d were next on the agenda.\n\n\u201cThere is good news \u2013 that Brazil is growing and that it favours Argentina and Mercosur,\u201d said the former vice-president.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bolsonaro called for a bilateral meeting with President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez in Montevideo on March 1, when incoming leader Luis Lacalle Pou will be sworn-in as Uruguay\u2019s president.\n\n\u201cI am interested in talking with Fern\u00e1ndez,\u201d Bolsonaro said Thursday, who said he will \u201cdelay\u201d his return from Montevideo \u201c as much a possible \u201d to talk with other regional heads of state.\u201d Analysts hope a potential meeting would be a sign that tensions between the two nations have calmed, with pragmatism taking over.\n\nHowever, Fern\u00e1ndez on Thursday placed the potential meeting with Bolsonaro in doubt, though he said he would find other ways to meet his Brazilian counterpart.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can go because that day the ordinary sessions of the Congress are inaugurated here in Argentina,\u201d at which he must make a speech, Fern\u00e1ndez said in an interview with Rivadavia radio.\n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t travel that day, I\u2019m going to propose [to Bolsonaro] to travel the next day to see him,\u201d he added.\n\nBolsonaro, who heads an ultra-conservative government with a liberal economic agenda, was an open supporter of former president Mauricio Macri, who was defeated by Fernandez in last October\u2019s election.\n\nThe Brazilian president refused to attend the inauguration and planned to send any high-level representation, though he eventually decided Vice-President Hamilton Mour\u00e3should attend.\n\nOn Thursday, the two nations agreed to move forward with a common agro-industrial development agenda after talks between officials that began last month.\n\n\u201cArgentina and Brazil, together with the countries of the region, have a huge opportunity to be food suppliers and to add value to the raw materials that are generated in agricultural production,\u201d said Argentina\u2019s Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Minister Luis Basterra.\n\nIn other foreign policy remarks, Fern\u00e1ndez also said Thursday t hat he would travel to Washington to meet US President Donald Trump \u201cat some time\u201d later this year.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["James Grainger", "Https", "Fotos.Perfil.Com Autores Default",
