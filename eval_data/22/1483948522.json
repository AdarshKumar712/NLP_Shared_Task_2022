Whether you\u2019re more of a linguini lover or mad for macaroni, there\u2019s really nothing like a hearty helping of the feel-good dish.\n\nYou might be prepared to give up a lot for veganuary 2020 \u2013 where people try to go vegan for a month \u2013 and you might think you can just get away with not sprinkling cheese on top of your beloved pasta, but what is pasta actually made from?\n\nBrace yourself and read on to find out whether or not vegans can eat pasta\u2026\n\nIs pasta vegan?\n\nLike so many things in life, there isn\u2019t a clear yes or no \u2013 it depends on the type of pasta you\u2019re eating.\n\nWhen it comes to pasta, there\u2019s usually two types: fresh pasta and pasta secca (aka dried pasta).\n\nHnnng (Picture: Getty)\n\nFresh pasta is usually made and cooked in the same setting and is usually not vegan because it can contain eggs, whereas dry pasta is nearly always vegan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re making dry pasta for yourself at home, double-check the packaging but you\u2019re most likely not going to fail veganuary as a result.\n\nIf you\u2019re eating pasta out at a restaurant, ask if the fresh pasta was made with eggs or oil.\n\nGiving up fresh pasta might be worth it though \u2013 especially if you want to boost your erections.\n\nNetflix documentary The Game Changers tested athletes to try out a vegan diet, and by switching to a plant-based diet, their eggplants noticed the difference, standing tall for up to 500% longer in one case.\n\nHow is fresh pasta made?\n\nThe typical ingredients for fresh pasta include flour, water, salt, and eggs \u2013 note that some fresh pasta can be made with oil instead of eggs, but it\u2019s more likely than not to be made with eggs.\n\nFirst, the flour and salt are mixed together in a mixing bowl before a well is made in the middle of the flour.\n\nThis is when the eggs are normally added; they\u2019re cracked right inside the centre of the flour well.\n\nThe flour is mixed into the eggs until a dough forms.\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, the dough is cut into the pasta shape of choice.\n\nYou can buy vegan fresh pasta alternatives from most major supermarkets, including Waitrose\u2019s vegan ravioli and Sainsburys\u2019 non-egg spaghetti and shroomballs.\n\nHow is dried pasta made?\n\nThe majority of dried pasta, on the other hand, is vegan and made from just two ingredients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost mass-produced dried pastas \u2013 which you can buy from supermarkets \u2013 contain just flour and semolina.\n\nSemolina, derived from a wheat product, is first mixed with water. This mixture then gets processed in bulk quantities by machines creating a sort of dough.\n\nThis dough is then pressed through pasta molds to get the intended shape.\n\nMORE: No, doing Veganuary won\u2019t turn you into a woman\n\nMORE: Is peanut butter vegan?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Veganuary", "Vegan"], "authors": ["Jack Slater"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "As veganuary 2020 gets underway, let's look at the most important question you'll need answering: is pasta vegan?", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/m-icon-black.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "google-site-verification": "NRfCb8mBNAy5_f17NpvLZYoY38EzM2dgpcOh_Am9yps", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1163518323.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=594&h=396&crop=1"}, "title": "Is pasta vegan?
