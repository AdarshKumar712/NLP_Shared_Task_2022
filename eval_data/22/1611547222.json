In Lima, Peru, patients took up 80% of intensive care beds as of Friday. Peru has the world's 12th-highest number of confirmed cases, with more than 90,000.\n\n\u201cWe're in bad shape,\u201d said Pilar Mazzetti, head of the Peru's COVID-19 task force. \u201cThis is war.\u201d\n\nIn some cities, doctors say patients are dying because of a lack of ventilators or because they couldn't get to a hospital fast enough. With intensive care units swamped, officials plan to move patients from capitals like Lima and Santiago to hospitals in smaller cities that aren't as busy \u2013 running the risk of spreading the disease further.\n\nLatin American countries halted international flights and rolled out social distancing guidelines around the same time as the U.S. and Europe, delaying the arrival of large-scale infection, said Dr. Marcos Espinal, director of communicable diseases at the Pan American Health Organization.\n\n\u201cLatin America was the last wave,\u201d said Espinal, who previously worked at the World Health Organization.\n\nHe warned that authorities need to maintain anti-virus restrictions even as the U.S. and Europe reopen. Some of the hardest-hit cities, like Lima and Santiago, imposed strict, early lockdowns. But officials have struggled to enforce them, whether among the wealthy who are used to flouting regulations or lower-income people who depend on day labor or selling things on the street to feed their families.\n\nA month after hitting Ecuador's coastal city of Guayaquil in one of the first blows to Latin America, COVID-19 is sickening thousands in the capital of Quito, where 80% of intensive care beds were occupied as of Friday.\n\n\u201cI have a 26-year-old woman next to me who walked in. Three hours later, she's suffocating because we don't have a respirator available,\u201d said an intensive care doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to the media. \u201cI think we're getting to the point that you saw in Europe, where people died for lack of respirators.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed May 20 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "QUITO, Ecuador \u2013 Beyond the hot spots of Brazil and Mexico, the coronavirus is threatening to overwhelm Latin American cities large and small in ...", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@jgfortwayne"}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Latin America seeing 'last wave' | World | Journal Gazette", "image": {"identifier": "https://121-jgweb.newscyclecloud.com/storyimage/JG/20200520/ARTICLE/305209963/AR/0/AR-305209963.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 573}, "url": "https://www.journalgazette.net/news/world/20200520/latin-america-seeing-last-wave", "description": "QUITO, Ecuador \u2013 Beyond the hot spots of Brazil and Mexico, the coronavirus is threatening to overwhelm Latin American cities large and small in ..."}, "fb": {"app_id": 123063833967}, "description": "QUITO, Ecuador \u2013 Beyond the hot spots of Brazil and Mexico, the coronavirus is threatening to overwhelm Latin American cities large and small in ...", "__sync_contentCategory": "Paid"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.journalgazette.net/news/world/20200520/latin-america-seeing-last-wave"}
