This is what BirdLife Switzerland is encouraging people to do in a campaign to gather information on bird species.\n\nTo participate in the campaign, \u201cBirds of our Gardens\u201d, which runs from Wednesday to Sunday, people are invited to go to their balconies or gardens for one hour a day and note all the birds they have seen or heard. Tools are available on the organisation\u2019s website to help identify the birds.\n\nParticipants are being asked to note the biggest number of individuals seen simultaneously and to describe natural elements where they were spotted, such as water points and hedges.\n\nPeople who share their information with BirdLife also get the chance to win prizes including a pair of binoculars in a prize draw.\n\nBirdLife gathers data each year from across Switzerland. It says it is looking forward to seeing which is the most common bird this year and how natural elements near balconies or in gardens influence the number and diversity of visiting birds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeystone-SDA/jc\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed May  6 14:17:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.expatica.com/app/themes/expatica/assets/images/favicons/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "application-name": "Expat Guide to Switzerland | Expatica", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.expatica.com/app/themes/expatica/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.expatica.com/app/themes/expatica/assets/images/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.expatica.com/app/themes/expatica/assets/images/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.expatica.com/app/themes/expatica/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.expatica.com/app/themes/expatica/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "google-site-verification": "sgMNviXG2krwk6u7qeB2sVJQj1HzQ95FooPcxTSMarU", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Swiss encouraged to do some balcony birdwatching\u00a0 - Expat Guide to Switzerland | Expatica", "description": "If you are\u00a0looking for\u00a0a\u00a0rewarding and relaxing\u00a0hobby while confined at home, why not try\u00a0a spot of housebound ornithology?
