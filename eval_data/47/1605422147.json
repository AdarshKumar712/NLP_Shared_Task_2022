\u201cThe terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.\u201d\n\nWe must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added\n\nGhebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.\n\n\u201cWe should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.\u201d\n\nA six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.\n\nAccording to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.\n\nThese people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, \u201cbecause HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed\u201d.\n\nThe report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV\n\nSince 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region\n\nEvery death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.\n\n\u201cWe cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.\u201d\n\nIf HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.\n\nByanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.\u201d\n\neashimwe@newtimesrwanda.com", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["AIDS deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double", "U.N warns | newtimes", "rwanda news", "tnt", "rwanda", "kigali", "news", "east africa"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed May 13 13:53:31 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NewTimesRwanda", "domain": "newtimes.co.rw", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/aids-deaths-sub-saharan-africa-could-double-un-warns", "title": "AIDS deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double, U.N warns"}, "keywords": "AIDS deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double, U.N warns | newtimes,rwanda news,tnt,rwanda,kigali,news,east africa", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The New Times | Rwanda", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/aids-deaths-sub-saharan-africa-could-double-un-warns", "title": "AIDS deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double, U.N warns", "updated_time": "2020-05-13T13:56:43+02:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/sites/default/files/main/articles/2020/05/13/2e433b75-1c71-48d3-baca-59da1eb9eb8a.jpg", "url": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/sites/default/files/main/articles/2020/05/13/2e433b75-1c71-48d3-baca-59da1eb9eb8a.jpg", "type": "jpg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-05-13T13:53:31+02:00", "modified_time": "2020-05-13T13:56:43+02:00"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/aids-deaths-sub-saharan-africa-could-double-un-warns"}
