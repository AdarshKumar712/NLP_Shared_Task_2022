To overcome this situation, a compensation has been announced today.\u201d\n\nFlower growers and vegetable farmers\n\nFlower growers have faced many difficulties after their crops had been destroyed following the lack of demand for their produce due to lockdown. It is said farmers had cultivated flowers in about 11,687 hectares of land. \u201cRealising flower growers problems, government has decided upon a compensation of Rs 25,000 per hectare limited to the maximum extent of one hectare for the flower growers who have suffered crop loss,\u201d said Yediyurappa.\n\nFarmers who have grown vegetables and fruits were also not able to market their produce. Hence, the government has announced a relief package to this section as well.\n\nYediyurappa said, \u201cCovid-19 not only affected farmers, but also affected the service professionals such as barbers and washermen (Dhobis) both in urban and rural areas.

In addition to this, the government has decided to transfer additional amount of Rs 3,000 to building workers through DBT.\n\nMSMEs\n\n\u201cThe monthly fixed charges of electricity bills of MSMEs will be waived for two months. Payment of fixed charges in the electricity bills of the large industries will be deferred without penalty and interest for a period of two months,\u201d Yediyurappa said.\n\nThe following benefits will be provided for electricity consumers of all categories: Incentive and concessions will be given to the consumer who pays the bills in stipulated time. There will be a reduction in the interest rates on the amount for the delayed payment. Incentive will be provided to the consumers who pays the bills in advance.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity will be provided for the payment of balance bill amount in instalments. Electricity connection will not be disconnected till June 30, 2020 for the consumers, who have not paid the balance amount of electricity bill,\u201d said Yediyurappa.\n\nWeavers\n\nThe State government has already announced \u201cWeavers Loan Waiver\u201d scheme worth Rs 109 crore. \u201cOf which, Rs 29 crore had been released during 2019-20.

The reimbursement benefit will be provided for the weavers who have repaid their loan amount between January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2019,\u201d said the Chief Minister.\n\nHe further said, \u201cI am pleased to announce a new scheme Nekarara Sammana Yojane for the benefit of the suffering weavers.
