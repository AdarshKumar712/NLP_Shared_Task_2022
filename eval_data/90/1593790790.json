She is a lifelong resident of Puerto Rico and knows the small business community across the area intimately. Her leadership and know-how will help small business owners rebuild and recover while continuing to power the economies of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands,\u201d said Bulger, who oversees the federal agency\u2019s operations in the Atlantic Region of Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, New York and New Jersey.\n\nJ. Adalberto Quijada, SBA district director of Orange County-Inland Empire in California, who last month was appointed acting Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands District director, has been delegated other responsibilities in support of SBA\u2019s national operations.\n\n\u201cIt has been a pleasure leading SBA\u2019s team in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands during a time of transition and extraordinary circumstances for all,\u201d Quijada said. \u201cAs I assume national responsibilities within the SBA, I reiterate my support to Mar\u00eda de los Angeles and the entire district office, as they continue to serve the small business community with the passion and dedication for which they are known.\u201d\n\nDe Jes\u00fas said, \u201cToday more than ever, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands small businesses need our support to help overcome the economic challenges they are facing. I am committed to leading our district office to ensure we provide that assistance, and, in turn, help maintain the jobs that will keep our economy moving forward.\u201d\n\nDe Jes\u00fas began her career with the federal government at the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA\u2019s) Rural Development Puerto Rico State Office, where she served for 27 years prior to joining the SBA in 2012.\n\nDuring her last seven years with USDA, de Jes\u00fas held the title of business and cooperative program director, managing a commercial loan guaranty program with a $25 million loan limit, as well as federal grants to create and save jobs through commercial initiatives.\n\nFor more information on SBA\u2019s programs and services, visit www.sba.gov/pr.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Apr 30 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles de Jes\u00fas, who eight years ago joined the U.S. Small Business Administration (US SBA) as deputy director of SBA's Puerto Rico and U.S.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://stthomassource.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/source-avatar-256.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://stthomassource.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/MariadeJesus-SBA.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 1200, "secure_url": "https://stthomassource.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/MariadeJesus-SBA.jpg"}, "type": "article", "title": "SBA Appoints Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas Acting District Director of PR, USVI | St. Thomas Source", "description": "Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles de Jes\u00fas, who eight years ago joined the U.S. Small Business Administration (US SBA) as deputy director of SBA's Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands District Office, has been", "url": "https://stthomassource.com/content/2020/04/30/sba-appoints-maria-de-jesus-acting-district-director-of-pr-usvi/", "site_name": "St. Thomas Source"}, "description": "Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles de Jes\u00fas, who eight years ago joined the U.S. Small Business Administration (US SBA) as deputy director of SBA's Puerto Rico and U.S.", "fb": {"admins": 214286298592747, "app_id": 1466393260300306}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-04-30T22:28:02Z", "modified_time": "2020-04-30T22:28:02Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@VI_Source", "domain": "stthomassource.com", "title": "SBA Appoints Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas Acting District Director of PR, USVI | St.", "description": "Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles de Jes\u00fas, who eight years ago joined the U.S. Small Business Administration (US SBA) as deputy director of SBA's Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands District Office, has been", "image": "https://stthomassource.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/MariadeJesus-SBA.jpg"}, "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "https://stthomassource.com", "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress."}, "canonical_link": "https://stthomassource.com/content/2020/04/30/sba-appoints-maria-de-jesus-acting-district-director-of-pr-usvi/"}
