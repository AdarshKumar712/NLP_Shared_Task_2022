While the reasons for the cancellation are obvious, the damage is gigantic.\n\nIf there is one thing the First Minister of Bavaria and the First Mayor of Munich generally hate to do, it is cancelling the Oktoberfest. Today, Markus S\u00f6der and Dieter Reiter did so anyway. Many believe they had no choice.\n\nNo Distance or Masks\n\n\u201cThe two of us are the biggest fans\u201d, S\u00f6der said during a press conference with Reiter. He meant the \u201cgreatest festival in the world\u201d during which the Mayor of Munich taps the first beer barrel. It is an old tradition. The First Minister of Bavaria gets to take the first gulp. Not this year though.\n\n\u201cAs long as there is no vaccine and no medication [against the Coronavirus], we need to be careful\u201d, Markus S\u00f6der stated. The risk was simply too big. At the Oktoberfest, \u201cyou can neither keep your distance, nor work with masks\u201d, the First Minister said.\n\nS\u00f6der, who is part of the conservative CSU, rejected the idea of having a smaller festival, as an alternative. \u201cThe \u2018Wiesn\u2019 either takes place or it does not\u201d, he told the press in Munich. \u2018Wiesn\u2019 is the local word for the Oktoberfest. He and Mayor Reiter had taken the decision to cancel this year\u2019s Oktoberfest together, S\u00f6der said. \u201cIt hurts us. What a pity. This is not a normal year.\u201d\n\nEnormous Financial Loss\n\nDieter Reiter, a member of the center-left SPD, stressed the cooperation with Bavaria\u2019s government was excellent. On the other hand, the cancellation of the Oktoberfest was a \u201cbitter pill\u201d, also economically.\n\nBusinesses at the Oktoberfest and in the city of Munich usually make more than 1 billion Euro (1.1 billion U.S. Dollars or 0.9 billion Pounds Sterling) during the 16 days it lasts. This includes restaurants and hotels. Waitresses and waiters in the festival\u2019s large beer tents earn up to 12,000 Euro (13,000 Dollars or 10,480 Pounds) during the Oktoberfest.\n\nThe tax income generated by the festival is big too. While 70 percent of the event\u2019s visitors are from Bavaria, hundreds of thousands of people from other parts of Germany and the world usually come as well, to drink gallons of beer and to listen to Bavarian music.\n\nSix Million Visitors to Stay at Home\n\nNowadays, the Oktoberfest does not only include countless beer tents, but also a giant amusement park, which is yet another tourist magnet. The festival itself was founded 210 years ago, in 1810, when Prince Ludwig married Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. Today, up to 6 million visitors show up each year.\n\nBy the way: The publication you are reading, The Berlin Spectator, was established in January of 2019.
