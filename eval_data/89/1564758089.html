But then I got there, and (the promoters and venues) were taking it as seriously as you would expect them to,” he said. “They only sold half the venue (in Clearwater), so they spread everyone throughout the venue. It was weird walking out there, but everyone kept their masks on and once we started playing, it felt normal again. I thanked the crowd for being responsible and respectful. I think if the artist lets you know that it’s OK to wear your mask, and it’s the right thing to do, people get it.”"},{"_id":"VFU2NDLYFZEJRHTW7Q4KPQ5VKY","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/photo/resize/WkN2H7l0yuBzHVXgSTB4P8z24J0=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/VFU2NDLYFZEJRHTW7Q4KPQ5VKY.jpeg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"Ed Roland Collective Soul.jpeg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/VFU2NDLYFZEJRHTW7Q4KPQ5VKY.jpeg","owner":"melissa.ruggieri@ajc.com","proxyUrl":"/photo/resize/WkN2H7l0yuBzHVXgSTB4P8z24J0=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/VFU2NDLYFZEJRHTW7Q4KPQ5VKY.jpeg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"http://thumbor-prod-us-east-1.photo.aws.arc.pub/WkN2H7l0yuBzHVXgSTB4P8z24J0=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/VFU2NDLYFZEJRHTW7Q4KPQ5VKY.jpeg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/Q92yBmHiISsZCsXqidhZR3quwdM=/300x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/VFU2NDLYFZEJRHTW7Q4KPQ5VKY.jpeg","version":0,"template_id":594,"comments":[],"_id":"WW2EQODUH5ASFJD32WNGKNQJOA"},"address":{},"caption":"Collective Soul, led by singer Ed Roland, played their first concerts since March at the end of December in Florida, including New Year's Eve in Kissimmee.","created_date":"2021-01-07T20:35:49Z","credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"byline":"Astrid Lange","name":"Astrid Lange","type":"author"}]},"distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"8aec2b8c-455c-4816-903d-79fc8fdf8019"},"height":2240,"image_type":"photograph","last_updated_date":"2021-01-07T20:35:49Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"ajc","sponsored":false},"source":{"name":"AJC","source_type":"staff","additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"https://ajc.arcpublishing.com/photo/VFU2NDLYFZEJRHTW7Q4KPQ5VKY","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"Ed Roland Collective Soul","type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/VFU2NDLYFZEJRHTW7Q4KPQ5VKY.jpeg","version":"0.10.3","width":3196},{"_id":"U5FPGHRA3JEKDN6U2JIK3S4L44","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1610077371986},"content":"While Roland and his bandmates relished playing their melodic rock hits for live audiences again — the outdoors New Year’s Eve concert was staged with barricaded sections to keep fans about 6-to-10 feet from the stage and in separated pockets — he doesn’t envision a “normal” tour until June."},{"_id":"UJBD4ZZLTVGTZAFW5STFUNCLEY","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1610077371987},"content":"That early summer dartboard is a consistent barometer in the live music industry — at least as of now."},{"_id":"VHOBUTQ3ABBE7MHU3JOKWG336M","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1610077371988},"content":"Live Nation, the world’s largest concert promoter which stages the majority of shows at Atlanta venues including Cellairis Amphitheatre at Lakewood, Chastain, the Tabernacle and Ameris Bank Amphitheatre in Alpharetta, is also eyeing a summer restart."},{"_id":"6W5N6BQNRZHK3DFOMI2ZPZDVLI","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1610077371989},"content":"“The health and safety of fans, artists and staff continue to be our top priority, and we’re working closely with local health and government officials to ensure a safe concert experience for all as we get back to the shows we love very soon,” said Peter Conlon, president of Live Nation Atlanta."},{"_id":"MRIAE7BOL5H7LM4YR5KMNHO35M","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[{"pos":166,"comment":"Covid-19"}],"_id":1610077371990},"content":"Charlie Brusco, president of Red Light Management Atlanta, which counts Collective Soul, Styx and Poison among its roster, is cautiously optimistic that the COVID-19  vaccine will embolden music fans to return to venues.

6, 2021 Atlanta: Fulton County election workers resumed counting ballots at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021 an hour later than election officials had planned. Fulton elections director Richard Barron told county commissioners Wednesday morning there are 7,500 absentee ballots left to be uploaded. Fulton spokeswoman Jessica Corbitt said there are 2,700 left to be processed at Georgia World Congress Center. Mail-in ballots take more time to count because they are more complicated to tabulate. There are a variety of reasons, including an adjudication process that allows ballots with stray markings or other irregularities to be reviewed by poll watchers from each party. The adjudication process for those remaining ballots will begin today at 3 p.m. That means Fulton’s ballots won’t be uploaded until after 3 p.m., Barron said. The process will occur at the county’s English Street warehouse, which is where votes are actually uploaded once they’ve been adjudicated. “We have been unfairly, and I’ll state that unequivocally, unfairly criticized by any number of people,” Fulton Commission Chairman Robb Pitts said during a virtual press conference, “no justification whatsoever.” State election officials said voting generally went smoothly Tuesday, with short lines and average wait times of about 1 minute.

I’ve never released a record before, so my idea of what it would feel like — I don’t have a clue. Putting out a record during a pandemic, that’s very different. But I’ve gotten so much closer to my fans online and created a snail mail account so they can have access to my P.O. Box.

Then I got to (Bush’s 1980 song) “Babooshka.” She’s one of those artists I can listen to again and again. I also love Ashnikko, who went viral on TikTok. I like to find any type of music that makes me sit back and go, “Huh. Where did that come from? Why do I want to sing that over and over again?” When I tell my stories, they’re country, and when I talk and especially when I drink, I’m country. But that said, how I fell into country, there’s something about classic country I hope I can keep alive in my music in the lyrical songwriting.

We wanted to record some of the songs that we loved off the records we made that never really made it into the show. Dave and I sat down and put together a pretty long list. We had played Eddie’s once before and liked the vibe. We went to a few of the guys in our backup band including Randy (Threet), the bassist, and Steve Grisham from the Outlaws, along with (guitarist) Dale Oliver, who was an original member of the touring band, and Bobby Huff, who we invited to play percussion. Also a Nashville session player, Jason Roller, he played violin and mandolin with us. We wanted to impress upon people that our songwriting was very comprehensive. I think selfishly my goal was to cast BlackHawk with an artistic sort of personality and separate us a little from the commercial country bands. There were a number of successful bands in that ’90s timeframe, but they were more country-lifestyle related. With BlackHawk, we were just wired differently.
