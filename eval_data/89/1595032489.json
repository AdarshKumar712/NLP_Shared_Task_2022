grandfathers and the doctors who helped save the Prime Minister\u2019s life.\n\nMs Symonds, 32, posted a picture of her cradling the newborn on Instagram on Saturday, saying she \u201ccouldn\u2019t be happier\u201d and that her \u201cheart is full\u201d.\n\nShe praised the maternity team at University College Hospital in London, who she said \u201clooked after us so well\u201d.\n\nMs Symonds and Wilfred are understood to be back in Number 10 with Mr Johnson.\n\nThe couple announced on Wednesday that she had given birth to a baby boy earlier that day.\n\nIt came just weeks after Mr Johnson was discharged from intensive care where he had been battling coronavirus. Ms Symonds also suffered symptoms of the disease.\n\nShe wrote in her Instagram post: \u201cIntroducing Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson born on 29.04.20 at 9am.\n\nAdvertising\n\n\u201cWilfred after Boris\u2019 grandfather, Lawrie after my grandfather, Nicholas after Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart \u2013 the two doctors that saved Boris\u2019 life last month.\n\n\u201cThank you so, so much to the incredible NHS maternity team at UCLH that looked after us so well. I couldn\u2019t be happier. My heart is full.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson, who is currently grappling with the Covid-19 crisis, is expected to take a \u201cshort period\u201d of paternity leave later in the year.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe new family are planning to live in their Downing Street flat along with their dog Dilyn, Downing Street has said.\n\nThe baby\u2019s first name is a tribute to Mr Johnson\u2019s paternal grandfather, Osman Wilfred Kemal, later Johnson, whose father, an interior minister of the Ottoman Empire, was killed in the 1922 Turkish War of Independence. His mother, Winifred, died in childbirth.\n\nProfessor Marcel Levi, chief executive of University College London Hospital, congratulated the couple on the birth of their son.\n\nHe added: \u201cI would like to thank the teams who cared for Carrie and her baby. They are an incredibly skilled, dedicated and compassionate group of professionals who put patients at the heart of everything they do.\n\n\u201cI am very proud of them and all our staff at UCLH who are working extremely hard in very difficult circumstances at the moment.\u201d \u200b\n\nIn February, the couple announced they were expecting a baby in \u201cearly summer\u201d and that they had become engaged at the end of 2019.\n\nThey made history as the first unmarried couple to officially live together in Downing Street when they moved in last summer, after Mr Johnson won the Conservative Party leadership contest.\n\nThe new arrival is the third baby born to a serving prime minister in recent history.\n\nClapping again for our tremendous carers tonight and wishing hero @captaintommoore a very happy birthday. I also have another wonderful reason to thank the NHS this week too ?
