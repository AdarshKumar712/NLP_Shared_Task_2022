He said he and Kim were \u201cdoing fine,\u201d without elaborating.He added that the US and North Korea would have gone to war had he not been elected and championed the bilateral denuclearization talks now in limbo.\u201cHe could have been referring to the personal letters exchanged in the past, we are not sure. But there was no letter addressed recently to Trump by the supreme leadership of the DPRK,\u201d the North said. DPRK stands for the country\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.It added that it would examine why the US was feeding a groundless story to the media and warned that the two leaders\u2019 relations should not be taken lightly.Since 2018, Kim and Trump have met on three occasions to discuss Pyongyang\u2019s denuclearization -- at two summits, one in Singapore and one in Hanoi, and briefly at Panmunjom on the inter-Korean border with President Moon Jae-in in attendance.But nuclear diplomacy has made little headway since October 2019, when the two countries failed to work out their differences over what steps to prioritize in the process of dismantling North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal.Pyongyang demands sweeping sanctions relief first, but Washington insists on scrapping the nuclear programs instead, with neither side seen willing to compromise.In late March, Trump sent Kim a letter seeking to expand cooperation with North Korea to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un\u2019s younger sister and a senior party official, said the letter was proof of the \u201cexceptional rapport\u201d between the two leaders.By Choi Si-young ( siyoungchoi@heraldcorp.com", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["The Korea Herald", "Korean news", "koreaHerald", "South Korea  news", "South Korea  news in english", "Asia News", "K-POP", "KPOP", "\ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\ud5e4\ub7f4\ub4dc", "\ub354\ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\ud5e4\ub7f4\ub4dc", "\ucf54\ub9ac\uc544 \ud5e4\ub7f4\ub4dc"], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Korea Herald", "Published", "Apr", "-", "Updated"], "publish_date": "Mon Apr 20 15:06:40 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "North Korea warned US President Donald Trump not to use his personal rapport with leader Kim Jong-un for \u201cselfish purposes,\u201d saying Kim had not sent the \u201cnice note\u201d Trump claimed to have received.   \u201cThe relations between the leaders of both countries are not to be taken up just for diversion or\u00a0be misused for selfish purposes,\u201d the North\u2019s Foreign Ministry said late Sun...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1195", "description": "North Korea warned US President Donald Trump not to use his personal rapport with leader Kim Jong-un for \u201cselfish purposes,\u201d saying Kim had not sent the \u201cnice note\u201d Trump claimed to have received.   \u201cThe relations between the leaders of both countries are not to be taken up just for diversion or\u00a0be misused for selfish purposes,\u201d the North\u2019s Foreign Ministry said late Sun...", "keywords": "The Korea Herald, Korean news, koreaHerald, South Korea  news, South Korea  news in english, Asia News, K-POP, KPOP,  \ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\ud5e4\ub7f4\ub4dc,\ub354\ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\ud5e4\ub7f4\ub4dc,\ucf54\ub9ac\uc544 \ud5e4\ub7f4\ub4dc", "author": "The Korea Herald", "google-site-verification": "UELFr9I8vnlcV3hPKolyZM8BBFAlib76JD9TZ-F6hVE", "fb": {"pages": 133597558822}, "og": {"title": "NK warns Trump rapport with Kim shouldn\u2019t be self-serving", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200420000733", "description": "North Korea warned US President Donald Trump not to use his personal rapport with leader Kim Jong-un for \u201cselfish purposes,\u201d saying Kim had not sent the \u201cnice note\u201d Trump claimed to have received.   \u201cThe relations between the leaders of both countries are not to be taken up just for diversion or\u00a0be misused for selfish purposes,\u201d the North\u2019s Foreign Ministry said late Sun...", "image": "http://res.heraldm.com/content/image/2020/04/20/20200420000658_0.jpg", "article": {"author": "Herald"}}, "resource-type": "article", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "NK warns Trump rapport with Kim shouldn\u2019t be self-serving", "site": "@Herald", "creator": "@Herald", "description": "North Korea warned US President Donald Trump not to use his personal rapport with leader Kim Jong-un for \u201cselfish purposes,\u201d saying Kim had not sent the \u201cnice note\u201d Trump claimed to have received.   \u201cThe relations between the leaders of both countries are not to be taken up just for diversion or\u00a0be misused for selfish purposes,\u201d the North\u2019s Foreign Ministry said late Sun...", "image": "http://res.heraldm.com/content/image/2020/04/20/20200420000658_0.jpg?1"}, "dable": {"item_id": 20200420000733}, "article": {"section": "North Korea", "published_time": "2020-04-20T15:06:40+09:00"}, "pnutcategory": 201}, "canonical_link": "http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200420000733"}
