In year two, the program expanded to 15 volunteers helping 28 children.\n\nNow in its third year the program has 11 volunteers helping 18 students. In addition to returning and new mentors from AIS, the program also has attracted participants from the community and other local organizations, including Family Federal Savings, Rollstone Bank & Trust and UMass Memorial HealthAlliance-Clinton Hospital.\n\n\u201cWe know that in order for kids to be academically successful in life, these early years are critical. Through their time and commitment, AIS is helping to level the playing field by providing intensive literacy mentoring to these very special kids. AIS continues to demonstrate what it means to be a socially responsible company,\u201d United Way of North Central Massachusetts President Kory Eng said.\n\nIn 2019, AIS received the Boston Business Journal\u2019s Corporate Citizenship Award for its work in supporting charitable organizations and community causes.\n\nFounded in 1989, AIS is known for offering market-relevant, feature-rich product lines that entice designers and support the diverse needs of end-users while offering exceptional value..
