She then worked with Hanna Barbera and went back to Disney.\n\nSpeaking to online entertainment site Deadline, her daughter said: \"Her whole life, she was late for everything. She was fastidious about her appearance and insisted that she wouldn\u2019t leave her room unless her \u2018eyebrows and lipstick\u2019 were on. Ann loved Casino Day at (her home) but wasn\u2019t a big fan of bingo!\"\n\n\"This past Friday was Ann\u2019s 91st birthday. Throughout the day, the incredible MPTF staff helped her connect with family and friends through Facetime so everyone could express their love and admiration for her.\n\n\"My mom had a great sense of humor, was extremely positive, and touched everyone who was lucky enough to meet her. She loved to have a good time.\"\n\nTributes from the animation world have been paid to the artist on social media.\n\nAnn Sullivan is credited as S. Ann Sullivan on IMDb, and she's credited on a number of Disney Renaissance classics, such as The Lion King and The Little Mermaid. Inking and painting was, even in the 90s, a valuable if easy-to-miss part of the animation process. Sad, sad story. \u2014 Josh Spiegel (@mousterpiece) April 14, 2020\n\nRIP, Disney cel paint artist Ann Sullivan, who has died from coronavirus complications at age 91. Her credits included The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Hercules, Tarzan, Lilo & Stitch, Fantasia 2000, and Home on the Range. \u2014 CartoonBrew.com - Animation News (@cartoonbrew) April 14, 2020", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Apr 14 07:56:16 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Disney animator Ann Sullivan, who is credited with The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Hercules, Tarzan, Lilo and Stich and Home on the Range, has died from Covid-19 aged 91.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.rte.ie/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "siteCS": "master", "language": "en", "app-name": "dotie", "fb": {"admins": 100010507681175, "pages": 103898372992206, "app_id": 212765848759773}, "pillar": "entertainment", "description": "Disney animator Ann Sullivan, who is credited with The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Hercules, Tarzan, Lilo and Stich and Home on the Range, has died from Covid-19 aged 91.", "topic": "entertainment", "pillarCS": "entertainment", "chapter1": "entertainment", "DC.identifier": "urn:epic:1130329", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=355836123, app-argument=rtenewsnow://article:1130329", "categories": "Entertainment, Movie, Movies, Disney, Ann Sullivan", "toptag": "Movies", "DC.type": "article", "DC.isPartOf": "urn:epic:350", "section": "Entertainment", "level2": "Entertainment", "article-type": "newsdocument", "DC.date": "2020-04-14T17:46:26+01:00", "date": "2020-04-14", "og": {"title": "Disney animator of Little Mermaid dies of Covid-19", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2020/0414/1130329-ann-sullivan/", "image": "https://img.rasset.ie/00141d90-1600.jpg", "site_name": "RTE.ie", "description": "Disney animator Ann Sullivan, who is credited with The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Hercules, Tarzan, Lilo and Stich and Home on the Range, has died from Covid-19 aged 91.", "published_time": "2020-04-14T07:56:16+01:00"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rteentertainment/", "published_time": "2020-04-14T07:56:16+01:00", "modified_time": "2020-04-14T17:46:26+01:00", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "Entertainment, Movie, Movies, Disney, Ann Sullivan"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@rte", "title": "Disney animator of Little Mermaid dies of Covid-19", "domain": "rte.ie", "creator": "@rteentertainment", "description": "Disney animator Ann Sullivan, who is credited with The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Hercules, Tarzan, Lilo and Stich and Home on the Range, has died from Covid-19 aged 91.", "image": "https://img.rasset.ie/00141d90-1600.jpg"}, "estagid": 33}, "canonical_link": "https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2020/0414/1130329-ann-sullivan/"}
