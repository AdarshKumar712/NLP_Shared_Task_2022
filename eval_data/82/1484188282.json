And we\u2019re big fans of Apple Arcade! You should totally check out our list of the service\u2019s best games once you\u2019re done here.\n\nIt\u2019s a flawed narrative, though. Look beyond the chaff of flavor-of-the-moment, ad-riddled games and microtransaction-heavy \u201cfreemium\u201d titles, and you\u2019ll find games that are every bit as good as what you\u2019ll see on Apple Arcade. Some of them are even better. And this list doesn\u2019t even count many of the fun freemium games that dropped in 2019, which include Nintendo\u2019s Mario Kart Tour and Bethesda\u2019s The Elder Scrolls: Blades. You should check them out, too, but I find they\u2019re a little too eager to dig into your pocketbooks for this list.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "iOS gaming is still in a good place thanks to mobile originals like \u2018Ordia\u2019 and console ports like \u2018Dead Cells.\u2019", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/www.idgcsmb.mw/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "iOS gaming is still in a good place thanks to mobile originals like \u2018Ordia\u2019 and console ports like \u2018Dead Cells.\u2019", "DC.date.issued": "2019-12-31", "date": "2019-12-31", "twitter": {"account_id": 611823, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "iOS gaming is still in a good place thanks to mobile originals like \u2018Ordia\u2019 and console ports like \u2018Dead Cells.\u2019", "site": "@macworld", "image": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/12/the-gardens-between2-100825593-orig.jpg", "title": "The 10 best iPhone and iPad games of 2019", "url": "www.macworld.com"}, "fb": {"app_id": 865450560227169}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.macworld.com/article/3511619/the-10-best-iphone-and-ipad-games-of-2019.html", "site_name": "Macworld", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/12/the-gardens-between2-100825593-large.3x2.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 800}, "title": "The 10 best iPhone and iPad games of 2019", "description": "iOS gaming is still in a good place thanks to mobile originals like \u2018Ordia\u2019 and console ports like \u2018Dead Cells.\u2019"}, "displaytype": "slideshow - gallery", "source": "macworld", "category": "gaming,games,ios", "storytype": "feature", "tags": "ipados 13,ios 13", "google-site-verification": "1NJELq6F-S44I5ACepf9_rYYEBLuwwVjJUv5PrT91SA", "msvalidate.01": "05F49F041AAA61528A0A3329A6C0C02D"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/3511619/the-10-best-iphone-and-ipad-games-of-2019.html"}
