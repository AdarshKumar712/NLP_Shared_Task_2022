Something\u2019s on your mind and it\u2019s not leaving until you\u2019ve settled the argument either internally or externally. Take a moment and breathe. Last week might\u2019ve been the time to listen, but now you\u2019re ready to act. Make time to do some deciding this week.\n\n\n\nTAURUS: Taurus, normally the flow of your life involves long deliberations and small time for action. This may be increasingly true this week, or maybe it\u2019s the opposite. Spend some time asking yourself whether or not the path you\u2019re on right now is right for you. If not, why do you want it to work so badly?\n\n\n\nGEMINI: If you\u2019re in a planning mood, dear Gemini, now is definitely the time to execute a weekend trip, a dinner or any other social gathering. Your extroverted tendencies are calling, and ignoring it will do you no good. Don\u2019t shut yourself inside out of fear; you should ride this out and see whatever is making you social until it\u2019s end.\n\n\n\nCANCER: Are you grappling for something new, Cancer? Maybe things are getting shaken up in your personal life. While change isn\u2019t always good, this might be a good time to fully embrace it. Remember your foundations, but don\u2019t be afraid to take a stroll on the wild side here or there.\n\n\n\nLEO: If whatever lies ahead of you isn\u2019t truly what your heart desires, why are you so interested in pursuing it? Maybe it\u2019s the need to change the game for whatever reason. Is this something you truly want? Your immediate answer might be a hard \u2018no,\u2019 but with some thought, you might be able to see what aspect of your option is so alluring.\n\n\n\nVIRGO: Virgo, right now you may feel like you\u2019re driver\u2019s side to an adventure comparable to your dreams. This isn\u2019t a bad thing! In fact, it\u2019s good to let go and enjoy what life has to offer. Just a warning \u2013 you may want to check to make sure the adventure isn\u2019t rose-colored before you commit to anything serious.\n\n\n\nLIBRA: If you\u2019re feeling lost this week, Libra, don\u2019t fret; the sky will clear soon (despite the weather forecasts). Maybe you\u2019re stuck on something or don\u2019t know what your next decision will be. Some friendly advice: think a bit more on the subject. Don\u2019t think for too long, though. Inaction is also action.\n\n\n\nSCORPIO: Are you leaning on someone, Scorpio? This week may feel like the time to ask for help from others, but make sure you\u2019re also listening to yourself. It can be easy to let other people take the reins, but you also need to trust your gut in this situation. Familiarity breeds contempt.\n\n\n\nSAGITTARIUS: It\u2019s easy to get fired up about something, Sagittarius. Don\u2019t mistake being hyped up for being passionate. Emotions like anger, sadness and apathy can get the best of us sometimes. It\u2019s important to hit the breaks and look around. Are you focusing on the devil in the details? Or just the details?\n\n\n\nCAPRICORN: Capricorn, all is not quiet this week. While you may be watching something to make sure nothing chaotic happens, it may be that rigidity isn\u2019t your friend either. It\u2019s time to trust your gut and express yourself. If not, venting is the other way to alleviate these hypervigilant feelings.\n\n\n\nAQUARIUS: Some days, Aquarius, it might feel like you\u2019re speaking another language than your friends. If you\u2019re trying to avoid calamity at all costs, this isn\u2019t the answer. Take the time to sit down, and sound out what you\u2019re trying to explain. There\u2019s no need to get up in arms over a little miscommunication.\n\n\n\nPISCES: While you may not be a huge fan of delayed gratification, Pisces, it may be the best thing for you right now. Life doesn\u2019t always go with your flow, and that\u2019s okay. Time to adjust and look at the big picture; it\u2019ll help you figure things out.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Feb 13 02:00:18 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://thedmonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cropped-Artboard-1@0.5x-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "What\u2019s in the stars this week?", "site_name": "The Daily Mississippian", "description": "ARIES: This week marks a string of compassionate days, Aries.
