He has been president of the college for 17 years.\n\n\"Dr. Rivera has distinguished herself through her work as an ethicist; her record of advancing the values of service, internationalism, and multiculturalism that define our institution; and her accomplishments as a senior leader in academia,\" said Jerry Crawford, Chair of the Macalester College Board of Trustees, in a Monday press statement.\n\n\"Her depth of knowledge and strategic thinking, as well as her ability to inspire, will serve the Macalester community well as we look to the opportunities and challenges of the future. We look forward to welcoming Dr. Rivera to Macalester.\"\n\nDr. Rivera has a BA in American Civilization from Brown University, an Ivy League school, as well as a Master's in Social Welfare from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nShe received her Doctor of Philosophy in Public Affairs at the University of Texas in Dallas.\n\nAs well as working for CWRU, she has also held research leadership positions at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the University of California, Irvine, and has been involved in national social justice and equity initiatives.\n\n\"It is an incredible honor and privilege to join the Macalester family,\" Rivera said. \u201cThis is a community where curious people thrive, where individuality is celebrated, and where the purpose of education is to equip students with tools to make an impact in the wider world.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["education", "Macalester College", "president", "St. Paul", "Minnesota", "MN News"], "tags": ["St. Paul", "Minnesota", "Macalester College", "education", "president"], "authors": ["Adam Uren"], "publish_date": "Mon Feb  3 16:57:35 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Dr. Suzanne Rivera is the first female president in the college's 145-year history.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/site/images/apple-touch-icon.png?v=2020-10-29-144107-25ef742-017393", "meta_data": {"author": "Adam Uren", "description": "Dr. Suzanne Rivera is the first female president in the college's 145-year history.", "keywords": "education,Macalester College,president,St. Paul,Minnesota,MN News", "section": "MN News", "pagetype": "article", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "item-id": "ci025cb0a830002738", "published": "2020-02-03T16:57:35Z", "dcterms.rightsHolder": "Bring Me The News LLC", "dcterms.dateCopyrighted": 2020, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/macalester-college-board-approves-appointment-of-its-17th-president", "image": "https://bringmethenews.com/.image/t_share/MTcwMjA1MzE0MDAyNDYyNTIw/screen-shot-2020-02-03-at-104613-am.jpg", "description": "Dr. Suzanne Rivera is the first female president in the college's 145-year history.", "domain": "bringmethenews.com"}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/macalester-college-board-approves-appointment-of-its-17th-president", "title": "Macalester College board approves appointment of its 17th president", "description": "Dr. Suzanne Rivera is the first female president in the college's 145-year history.", "image": "https://bringmethenews.com/.image/t_share/MTcwMjA1MzE0MDAyNDYyNTIw/screen-shot-2020-02-03-at-104613-am.jpg", "site_name": "Bring Me The News"}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "true", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Bring Me The News", "parsely-title": "Macalester College board approves appointment of its 17th president - Bring Me The News", "parsely-link": "https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/macalester-college-board-approves-appointment-of-its-17th-president", "parsely-image-url": "https://bringmethenews.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_400%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTcwMjA1MzE0MDAyNDYyNTIw/screen-shot-2020-02-03-at-104613-am.jpg", "parsely-post-id": "ci025cb0a830002738", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-02-03T16:57:35Z", "parsely-section": "MN News", "parsely-author": "Adam Uren", "parsely-tags": "education,Macalester College,president,St. Paul,Minnesota,MN News", "sailthru.title": "Macalester College board approves appointment of its 17th president", "sailthru.image.full": "https://bringmethenews.com/.image/t_share/MTcwMjA1MzE0MDAyNDYyNTIw/screen-shot-2020-02-03-at-104613-am.jpg", "sailthru.date": "2020-02-03T16:57:35Z", "sailthru.author": "Adam Uren", "sailthru.tags": "education,Macalester College,president,St. Paul,Minnesota,MN News", "sailthru.description": "Dr. Suzanne Rivera is the first female president in the college's 145-year history.", "phx": {"content-item-id": "ci025cb0a830002738", "content-object-type": "ContentArticle"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "address=no", "google-site-verification": "XIYIEOIs962Q4u-3fZgNLHgUQmZZyY60gLZxK-iCobs", "msvalidate.01": "565AA37CB662E60BF24DDCABEC686D8F", "generator": "Tempest - maven.io", "pinterest": "nohover"}, "canonical_link": "https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/macalester-college-board-approves-appointment-of-its-17th-president"}
