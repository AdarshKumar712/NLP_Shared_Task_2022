He also served as deputy prime minister for a period of time under the former prime minister Charlot Salwai.\n\nHis coalition government will include two other major parties, as well as a raft of independents and micro-parties.\n\nLoughman\u2019s government will be required to hit the ground running, after a tumultuous month for the country, which has a population of nearly 300,000 people.\n\nThe country declared a state of emergency in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, restricting business activity and travel and imposing a curfew on residents.\n\nThere have been no confirmed cases of the virus in the nation, but there are fears that were coronavirus to reach Vanuatu\u2019s shores, its health system would very quickly become overwhelmed.\n\nThe country also bore the brunt of the passage of Tropical Cyclone Harold in April. The category-5 storm wreaked damage and destruction across much of the north of the island group and killed three people.\n\nWhile some assistance has reached the affected communities, humanitarian efforts have been hampered by the coronavirus pandemic and many people remain without adequate shelter and are at risk of running out of food.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Tess Newton Cain"], "publish_date": "Mon Apr 20 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Bob Loughman, an MP from the island of Tanna, will become the next prime minister of the south Pacific nation", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.guim.co.uk/images/favicon-32x32.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "Bob Loughman, an MP from the island of Tanna, will become the next prime minister of the south Pacific nation", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/vanuatu-elects-new-prime-minister-as-country-reels-from-devastating-cyclone", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97c1684f3ad1ea0940c4f123f84ac4be433e8237/0_12_1474_884/master/1474.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMjAucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a57f7a4256d547218c7a3db938b8aac1", "description": "Bob Loughman, an MP from the island of Tanna, will become the next prime minister of the south Pacific nation", "type": "article", "title": "Vanuatu elects new prime minister as country reels from devastating cyclone", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tess-newton-cain", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "World news", "published_time": "2020-04-20T06:24:55.000Z", "tag": "Pacific islands,Vanuatu,World news,South Pacific,Asia Pacific", "modified_time": "2020-04-20T06:47:51.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2020/apr/20/vanuatu-elects-new-prime-minister-as-country-reels-from-devastating-cyclone?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2020/apr/20/vanuatu-elects-new-prime-minister-as-country-reels-from-devastating-cyclone?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/vanuatu-elects-new-prime-minister-as-country-reels-from-devastating-cyclone", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2020/apr/20/vanuatu-elects-new-prime-minister-as-country-reels-from-devastating-cyclone?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97c1684f3ad1ea0940c4f123f84ac4be433e8237/0_12_1474_884/master/1474.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMjAucG5n&s=b33e5c6ca607030c67e4b854adb17ecd", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/vanuatu-elects-new-prime-minister-as-country-reels-from-devastating-cyclone"}
