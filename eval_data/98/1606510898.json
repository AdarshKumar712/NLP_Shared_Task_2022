Building trust between the institutions within football requires collaboration from all involved, which will prove essential in increasing the international popularity of Spanish football.\n\n2. Each party should act with integrity and are obliged to comply by the rules and respect should be shown for decisions made by the other.\n\n3. Dialogue should be practised in a sincere, honest and constructive way in processes of joint decision-making.\n\n4. Conflict should be solved amicably through mediation mechanisms.\n\n5. Mutual respect and restraint should be shown in public statements, particularly during conflict-resolving.\n\n6. Transparency and the promotion of ethics should be practised in accordance with international standards and Spanish legislation, while internal ethics committees should be given more weight.\n\n7.
