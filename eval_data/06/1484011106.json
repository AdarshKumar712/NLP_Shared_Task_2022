So terrorists could have tracked the movements of strategic staff.\n\nHere we go again. In today\u2019s SB Blogwatch, we d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu anew.\n\nYour humble blogwatcher curated these bloggy bits for your entertainment. Not to mention: Rollin\u2019.\n\nAWS Data Lake Leak\n\nWhat\u2019s the craic? Charlie Osborne reports\u2014\u201cDatabase leaked 179GB in customer, US government, and military records\u201d:\n\nAn open database exposing records containing the sensitive data of hotel customers as well as US military personnel and officials has been disclosed. \u2026 Autoclerk, a service owned by Best Western Hotels and Resorts group \u2026 is a reservations management system used by resorts to manage web bookings, revenue, loyalty programs, guest profiles, and payment processing.\n\n\u2026\n\nIt had no encryption or security barriers whatsoever. \u2026 Hundreds of thousands of booking reservations for guests were available to view \u2026 including full names, dates of birth, home addresses, phone numbers, dates and travel costs, some check-in times and room numbers.\n\n\u2026\n\nIt appears that one of the platforms connected to Autoclerk exposed in the breach is a contractor of the US government that deals with travel arrangements. \u2026 Within the records, for example, were logs for US Army generals visiting Russia and Israel, among other countries.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) was informed of the leak on September 13 but did not respond.\n\nOuch. Lindsey O\u2019Donnell adds\u2014\u201cData Leaked By Autoclerk\u201d:\n\nAutoclerk \u2026 was acquired by the Best Western Hotel and Resorts Group in August. \u2026 Autoclerk software is used by third-party travel agencies [including] HAPI Cloud, OpenTravel and Synxis by Sabre Hospitality Solutions.\n\n\u2026\n\nBeyond the privacy implications of hackers getting their hands on PII of customers, researchers said that the reservation details of customers in the database could provide attackers with valuable clues to piece together fraud or phishing attacks. \u2026 The database could also have physically dangerous implications for victims \u2026 especially for potentially high-profile government or military personnel.\n\nWho found it? vpnMentor\u2019s Noam Rotem and Ran Locar\u2014\u201cTravel Reservations Platform Leaks\u201d:\n\nThe leak exposed sensitive personal data of users and hotel guests, along with a complete overview of their hotel and travel reservations \u2026 with millions of new records being added daily. \u2026 This represented a massive breach of security for the government agencies and departments impacted.\n\n\u2026\n\nWe have contacted the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT). We outlined the nature of the leak, and the government, military, and DHS data that was exposed. However, at the time of publishing, they have not replied to our email, ignoring our concerns.\n\n\u2026\n\nAll this information is incredibly valuable for criminal hackers and online thieves. \u2026 For the US government, alarm bells should be ringing. \u2026 Criminals could pose as hotels or booking engines used by guests, crafting convincing emails to easily fool them. The effects could be devastating, both financially and personally.\n\n\u2026\n\nThis represents a major flaw in the data security apparatus around such sensitive information. Any company concerned with the travel logistics of high-level military personnel should be adhering to the strictest data protection practices.\n\nAin\u2019t that the truth? e-sushi\u2014@originalesushi\u2014feels the shockwave:\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen it in the movies: that short, silent moment between the detonation of a nuke, and the blast that sets in to wipe you off this planet.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s how job security must feel when you were in charge of the security of that 179GB database.\n\nTime to prosecute the CEO? rtb61 curbs your enthusiasm:\n\nAhh padawan I see you do not understand, here is the lesson: lowest tender vs. safety and security. When you do it as cheap as you can, do not expect good outcomes\u2014they will not happen.\n\n\u2026\n\nProfit was the primary focus and costs are the enemy of profit, the blood enemy, the enemy to be ruthlessly, relentless attacked. And of course, the **** up turned into someone else\u2019s problem after you have wandered off with the profits and bonuses.\n\n\u2026\n\n[But] expect pretty rapid change after a CEO, board members and tech staff, receive years long custodial sentences. \u2026 You don\u2019t think they would ever give a **** about actual security do you? Only if there is a profit in it.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe system has been ****ed by psychopaths and will routinely fail.\n\nA slightly less sweary Dean of Pentacles\u2014@da_terry\u2014gets all wistful:\n\nRemember the 90s, when things needed to be hacked? Today, everything is just laying around on the internet.\n\nI know, right? Marlin Schwanke asks, \u201cWhy Even Bother Reporting Breaches?\u201d:\n\nWhy even bother to report this stuff anymore? We should all assume that every bit of our personal information is freely available online and get over it. The way business runs their IT it doesn\u2019t seem far off the mark.\n\n\n\nBusiness that amass and store consumer data in such a sloppy fashion should be shuttered. I won\u2019t be holding my breath.\n\nAnd Doctor Syntax is IN:\n\nYou\u2019d think by now that hotel chains would have learned that\n\n(a) they really need to do a thorough annual audit of their own security, and\n\n(b) do the same in spades for any business they\u2019re thinking of buying.\n\n\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s going to take a few more big fines and lawsuits, big enough for the board and investors to notice. Even then it seems doubtful that they\u2019ll manage to learn from the misfortunes of others.\n\nMeanwhile, Volatile_Memory randomly remembers:\n\nI stayed at a Best Western in Georgia (US) once and they had the username and password for their reservation system written on a note taped next to the computer. I told them about it and \u2026 was met with a bored stare.\n\nAnd Finally:\n\nThis is how we roll\n\nPreviously in And Finally\n\nYou have been reading SB Blogwatch by Richi Jennings.
