Protesters also demanded the arrests of the three other former officers who were present but failed to intervene. All three were booked into the Hennepin County jail on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cTo the Floyd family, to our beloved community, and everyone that is watching, I say: George Floyd mattered. He was loved. His life was important. His life had value. We will seek justice for him and for you and we will find it,\u201d Ellison said\n\nHowever, he said, he doesn\u2019t believe that \u201cone successful prosecution can rectify the hurt and loss that so many people feel. The solution to that pain will be in the slow and difficult work of constructing justice and fairness in our society.\u201d\n\nChauvin, who was recorded on video kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck as he begged for air on Memorial Day, now faces the more serious charge of second-degree murder, in addition to the original charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter with culpable negligence.\n\nChauvin was originally charged by the Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office last week.\n\nGallery: Community members gather to honor George Floyd, demands justice Gallery: Community members gather to honor George Floyd, demands justice\n\nThe amended complaint filed against Chauvin stated, \u201cPolice are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous. \u2026 Officer Chauvin\u2019s restraint of Mr. Floyd in this manner for a prolonged period was a substantial factor in Mr. Floyd losing consciousness, constituting substantial bodily harm, and Mr. Floyd\u2019s death as well.\u201d\n\nDon Lewis, special prosecutor in the case against Jeronimo Yanez, the former St. Anthony police officer who killed Philando Castile in 2016, said the nearly nine-minute recording of the moments before Floyd died showed ample evidence of intent to kill on Chauvin\u2019s part.\n\n\u201cThose are moments to cause reflection on whether or not you\u2019re in the middle of a wrongful death here,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cYou have George Floyd begging for his life, right? \u2018I can\u2019t breathe.\u2019 This is a moment of potential reflection on Chauvin\u2019s part,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cHe had multiple opportunities to change course here and decided not to over the span of almost 10 minutes.\u201d\n\nThe other officers at the scene \u2014 Tou Thao, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane \u2014 were each charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder while committing a felony, and with aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter with culpable negligence. Both charges are categorized as \u201cunintentional\u201d felonies.\n\nThao was recorded watching as Chauvin continued to press on Floyd\u2019s neck with his knee. Kueng was one of the first officers on the scene and helped pin Floyd down. Lane was detailed in earlier charges as pointing a gun at Floyd before handcuffing, and he later asked whether officers should roll Floyd on his side as he was restrained.\n\nThe charges come just days after Gov. Tim Walz asked Ellison to take over the prosecution, which until Sunday had been led by the Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office. Freeman stood next to Ellison as the attorney general announced the charges Wednesday, but he did not speak and left midway through the news conference.\n\nDespite the quick pace of adding charges to the investigation, Ellison sought to manage expectations, cautioning that the cases could take \u201cmonths\u201d to see through. He also brushed off the idea that intense public pressure influenced the process.\n\nThe charges noted that Floyd was \u201ccalm\u201d after he was first arrested and before Chauvin knelt on his neck. The complaint also noted three times that after Floyd was pinned to the pavement by three officers, none of them moved from their positions despite pleas from Floyd. Video of the incident showed that bystanders also pleaded with police.\n\nFloyd had told the first two officers at the scene \u2014 Lane and Kueng \u2014 that he was not resisting arrest but did not want to get into the back of their squad car because he is claustrophobic, the charges said.\n\nWalz issued a statement after Ellison announced the new charges. \u201cI laid flowers at George Floyd\u2019s memorial this morning. As a former high school history teacher, I looked up at the mural of George\u2019s face painted above and I reflected on what his death will mean for future generations. What will our young people learn about this moment? Will his death be just another blip in a textbook? Or will it go down in history as when our country turned toward justice and change?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on each of us to determine that answer,\u201d Walz said. \u201cThe charges announced by Attorney General Keith Ellison today are a meaningful step toward justice for George Floyd. But we must also recognize that the anguish driving protests around the world is about more than one tragic incident.\n\n\u201cGeorge Floyd\u2019s death is the symptom of a disease. We will not wake up one day and have the disease of systemic racism cured for us. This is on each of us to solve together, and we have hard work ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cWe owe that much to George Floyd, and we owe that much to each other.\u201d\n\nOne of the attorneys representing Floyd\u2019s family, Benjamin Crump, released a statement Wednesday praising the arrest and charging of the other three officers and the upgrading of murder charges against Chauvin. Crump\u2019s statement came after the Star Tribune first reported the charges and before Ellison\u2019s office made any official announcements.\n\n\u201cThis is a bittersweet moment for the family of George Floyd,\u201d said the joint statement by Floyd\u2019s family, Crump and the legal team. \u201cWe are deeply gratified that Attorney General Keith Ellison took decisive action in this case, arresting and charging all the officers involved in George Floyd\u2019s death and upgrading the charge against Derek Chauvin to felony second-degree murder.\u201d\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also released a statement in support of the new charges.\n\n\u201cThat George Floyd\u2019s plea \u2014 that his struggle to survive \u2014 went unrecognized and unaided by not just one but four officers will live forever as the most chilling moments in our city\u2019s history,\u201d Frey said. \u201cFailing to act amounted to a failure to recognize George\u2019s humanity.\u201d\n\nThe booking mugs of the three former Minneapolis officers charged Wednesday with aiding and abetting murder. From left are J Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. Derek Chauvin, who was previously charged, had a count of second-degree murder added.\n\nAttorney Eric Nelson, who is representing Chauvin, declined to comment. Chauvin remains in custody at the state prison in Oak Park Heights.\n\nKueng\u2019s attorney, Thomas Plunkett, released a statement Wednesday stating that his client was asked at 1:20 p.m. to turn himself in; he is being held at the Hennepin County jail. Plunkett, who represented former Minneapolis officer Mohamed Noor when he was tried and convicted in 2019 for fatally shooting Justine Ruszczyk Damond, declined further comment.\n\nAttorney Earl Gray, who is representing Lane, also declined to comment. Gray represented Yanez when he was tried and acquitted in 2017 for fatally shooting Castile.\n\nThao\u2019s attorney, Robert Paule, could not be reached for comment.\n\nFloyd\u2019s family and Crump, their lawyer, called the new charges \u201ca significant step forward on the road to justice, and we are gratified that this important action was brought before George Floyd\u2019s body was laid to rest \u2026 That is a source of peace for George\u2019s family in this painful time.\u201d\n\nThey urged Ellison to continue the investigation and upgrade the charges to first-degree murder, which carries a potential life sentence.\n\nFirst-degree murder requires proof of planning out the crime. Second-degree unintentional murder carries a maximum sentence of 40 years. Murder in the third degree has a maximum 25-year sentence. Charges of aiding and abetting carry the same maximum penalties as the underlying crime.\n\n\u201cThese officers knew they could act with impunity, given the Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s widespread and prolonged pattern and practice of violating people\u2019s constitutional rights,\u201d the family\u2019s statement said. \u201cTherefore, we also demand permanent transparent police accountability at all levels and at all times.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison spoke Wednesday about new charges filed against the former police officers in the killing of George Floyd. With Ellison was Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman.\n\nThe family thanked the \u201coutpouring\u201d of support it has received, which manifested in days of huge protests across the country and world.\n\n\u201cOur message to them: Find constructive and positive ways to keep the focus and pressure on,\u201d they said. \u201cDon\u2019t let up on your demand for change.\u201d\n\nThe former officers\u2019 prosecution is the quickest in Minnesota history against officers on the job who have killed civilians, and is the first time more than one officer involved in such an incident has been criminally charged. Three officers have previously been charged with killing a civilian on the job; Noor was convicted at trial while two were acquitted.\n\n\u201cLet me be honest here, our country has under-prosecuted these matters in Minnesota and throughout the country,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cWe can\u2019t control the past. All we can do is take the case that is in front of us right now and do our good-faith best to bring justice to this situation, and we will.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Stephen Montemayor", "Chao Xiong", "Stephen.Montemayor Startribune.Com", "Cxiong Startribune.Com", "Marci Schmitt", "Hennepin County Sheriff'S Office", "Leila Navidi", "Star Tribune"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A more serious charge of second-degree murder was added to the counts against Derek Chauvin.
