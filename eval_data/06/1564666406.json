The group remuneration committee and respective country heads will propose how to translate this commitment to the management teams in the various countries in due course. The group\u2019s bonus policy will be reviewed so that the maximum required resources are directed to supporting customers.\n\nSantander\u2019s Group executive chairman, Ana Bot\u00edn, said: \u201cFor many of us, the coronavirus pandemic is the single most significant challenge we have ever faced. The scale of the task before us demands a huge collective effort, with governments, central banks and other authorities, the private sector, charities and individuals, working together to limit the spread and provide care for those affected \u2013 whether directly or indirectly. We are committed to ensuring that Santander plays its part.\u201d\n\nSantander has already taken a number of steps to protect and support employees and customers, including: providing emergency liquidity for businesses facing hardship; facilitiating payment holidays in many of our markets; closing some branches to protect customers while also ensuring continuity of service across the whole branch network; protecting the wellbeing of employees through suspending travel and enabling home working, and requiring shareholders to participate virtually in its AGM next month. As the pandemic evolves in each of markets the bank is reviewing the situation everyday and acting in accordance with local needs in each of its markets.\n\nMeasures announced to date in each market", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Press Releases"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The board of directors will consolidate any dividend payment from 2020 earnings into a single payment in May 2021.
