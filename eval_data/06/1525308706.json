[+] 2019. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nTopline: Germany's sportswear giants Adidas and Puma have warned that China's coronavirus outbreak will severely impact sales while one of Europe's largest carmakers has resorted to flying parts in suitcases to keep its supply chain running.\n\nAdidas announced that its sales in China were down 85% on the same period last year, with the fall starting after it closed its stores for the Lunar new year on January 25. Many stores remain closed.\n\nRival Puma on Wednesday beat its 2019 earnings guidance. But it warned that a shutdown of more than half of its stores in China could hit first quarter sales and profits.\n\nThe impact of the outbreak is not limited to China - Britain's biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has resorted to flying over car parts from its Chinese suppliers in suitcases.\n\nJLR CEO Ralf Speth warned the firm would struggle to keep production flowing at its U.K. plants, which make 400,000 cars a year, within the next three weeks because of supply chain issues in China.\n\nSpeth said: \u201cWe are safe for this week and we are safe for next week and in the third week we have...parts missing. We have flown parts in suitcases from China to the U.K,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nElsewhere, JCB, which makes backhoes and construction machinery, cut its production and working hours amid a shortage of components. A quarter of its suppliers in China are shut.\n\nApple warned this week that it would not meet its revenue guidance, because of a slow factory reopenings in China, where much of the iPhone is manufactured.\n\nKey background: The world's second largest economy was officially meant to be open for business again on February 10 after the extended Lunar New Year holiday shutdown. The reality has been different with tens of millions still inside lockdown zones, while a patchwork of transport bans, and government checks have meant many factories, and businesses, have been barred from reopening, or have been left without workers, or raw material. Coronavirus deaths have topped 2,000, mostly in Wuhan, with 74,000 people now infected, China\u2019s health authorities said. More than 14,000 patients have been cured and discharged. But there is hope that the spread of the virus may be slowing, after China\u2019s health commission reported the lowest daily rise in new infections since January 29. The number of new infections outside Hubei province has fallen for the past two weeks.\n\nTangent: After more than two weeks, 500 passengers who tested negative for coronavirus aboard the Carnival-owned Diamond Princess cruise docked in Yokohama, Japan, are disembarking. Countries including the U.S. had already flown their citizens home earlier this week, while those who tested positive for the virus were taken to hospital. In total, 540 out of the 3,700 passengers and crew onboard, tested positive for the pneumonia-like virus\u2014around 1 in 7.\n\nFurther reading: Coronavirus Exposes Auto Industry\u2019s Lack Of Plan B (Ed Garsten)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Isabel Togoh", "Forbes Staff"], "publish_date": "Wed Feb 19 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "German sportswear brands Adidas and Puma have warned that the coronavirus will hit sales in one of its biggest markets.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i.forbesimg.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=5,minimum-scale=1,user-scalable=yes", "description": "German sportswear brands Adidas and Puma have warned that the coronavirus will hit sales in one of its biggest markets.", "author": "Isabel Togoh", "article": {"section": "Business", "section_url": "https://www.forbes.com/retail/", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/7323-5e4d36ec398f510006f6e9aa", "published": "2020-02-19", "modified": "2020-02-19", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes"}, "og": {"title": "Adidas\u2019 China Sales Slump 85% Due To Coronavirus", "site_name": "Forbes", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2020/02/19/adidass-china-sales-slump-85-due-to-coronavirus/", "image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F552730f749d0422c8329d2b57039f8d0%2F0x0.jpg", "description": "German sportswear brands Adidas and Puma have warned that the coronavirus will hit sales in one of its biggest markets.", "updated_time": "2020-02-19T11:15:14.480-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@forbes", "creator": "@bissieness", "title": "Adidas\u2019 China Sales Slump 85% Due To Coronavirus", "description": "German sportswear brands Adidas and Puma have warned that the coronavirus will hit sales in one of its biggest markets.", "image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F552730f749d0422c8329d2b57039f8d0%2F0x0.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2020/02/19/adidass-china-sales-slump-85-due-to-coronavirus/"}
