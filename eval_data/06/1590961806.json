We still have political prisoners, and exiles, and we demand our right to self-determination,\u201d Mr Torra said in reference to nine pro-independence leaders sentenced to prison last year for their part in an unlawful referendum in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe wanted independence before coronavirus, not because we want to fly our flag, but because we can give our citizens better opportunities and public services,\u201d Mr Torra told The Telegraph, insisting that, for now, his priority is \u201csaving lives\u201d.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez's Left-wing coalition government lacks a stable parliamentary majority and could be fatally weakened by internal divisions over social spending in response to the Covid-19 epidemic.\n\nThe chief spokeswoman for Catalonia\u2019s government, Meritxell Bud\u00f3, has said that fewer Catalans would have died from coronavirus if the region were run independently.\n\nMr Torra did not go so far, but accused Spain\u2019s government of centralising power over the health system under state of emergency legislation, and then moving too slowly as the fatalities from Covid-19 began to spiral towards the current toll of more than 23,000.\n\nThe Catalan president points to his call for a lockdown and decision to close off an area outside Barcelona before Spain moved to shut the country down on March 15, as well as disputing the decision to lift restrictions on non-essential economic sectors after Easter and Madrid\u2019s flip-flopping on whether to let children out to play or simply to accompany parents on errands.\n\n\u201cWhere is the scientific advice that made the government decide one thing and then change to another eight hours later? When we demanded the economy be shut down completely, we did so based on expert advice and with the unanimous support of doctors in Catalonia.\u201d\n\nMr Torra also questioned the Spanish government\u2019s commitment to transparency on the death count, noting that Catalonia includes data from funerary services and suspected Covid-related fatalities but the health ministry has so far refused to collate this information nationwide.\n\nInternational path out of lockdown More\n\nThe Catalan leader weighed into a freedom of expression row after it emerged that the Guardia Civil police force was investigating social media messages spreading disinformation could \u201ccreate social strain and disaffection with government institutions\u201d.\n\n\u201cI demand political responsibility from the Spanish state over a situation where the Guardia Civil is tracking people\u2019s posts on Twitter and looking for opinions against the government,\u201d Mr Torra said. \u201cWe cannot allow the slightest slip into authoritarianism.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["James Badcock"], "publish_date": "Tue Apr 28 06:53:50 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Catalonia is renewing its demands for independence from Spain as the coronavirus crisis threatens to break apart the country's fragile government.
