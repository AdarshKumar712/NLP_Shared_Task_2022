NanoSurface Plates\u2122 structure cell cultures into physiologically relevant tissue models by providing biomimetic topographic features that emulate the alignment of the native cellular microenvironment. For example, stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte cells can be cultured in NanoSurface Plates\u2122 to create cardiac microtissues for predictive preclinical drug screening.\n\nHuman stem-cell based assays hold great promise for modeling the safety and efficacy of drugs preclinically. However, these models can fail to properly represent human biology when the in vitro environment does not reproduce essential cues. Conventional glass or plastic cell culture dishes fail to imitate critical aspects of the native cellular microenvironment, resulting in cell cultures that do not adequately resemble the structure or function of native human tissues.\n\nNanoSurface Plates\u2122 feature a softer nanopatterned culture surface that mimics the aligned architecture of the native extracellular matrix. Cells on NanoSurface Plates\u2122 exhibit more physiologically representative structural and functional phenotypes. NanoSurface Plates\u2122 can be used to enhance preclinical cell-based assays with a wide variety of cell types, including those with cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle cells, neurons, migratory cancer cells, and many more.\n\nDr. Nicholas Geisse, Chief Science Officer of NanoSurface Biomedical, will present data highlighting NanoSurface technologies at the scientific podium session \u201cCellular Technologies - Application of Organ-on-chips and Micro-Physiological Systems\u201d at the annual Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening Conference on Monday, January 27. The focus of the presentation will be on engineering the cell niche to enhance iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte maturity and predictivity in a high-throughput, assay-agnostic manner.\n\n\u201cAt NanoSurface, we strive to make cells in the dish resemble cells in the body,\u201d said Michael Cho, CEO of NanoSurface Biomedical. \u201cThe 384-well NanoSurface Plate\u2122 allows drug developers to culture more physiologically relevant cells and tissues in a high-throughput, reproducible, and scalable format that will enhance their drug screening workflows.\u201d\n\n384-well NanoSurface Plates will be available March 2020. Pre-orders are available today via the NanoSurface contact form.\n\nNanoSurface Biomedical will exhibit at SLAS 2020 in Booth 2120.\n\nAbout NanoSurface Biomedical\n\nNanoSurface Biomedical is a biotechnology company based in Seattle, WA that develops biomimetic technologies to enhance cell-based assays and accelerate drug development.
