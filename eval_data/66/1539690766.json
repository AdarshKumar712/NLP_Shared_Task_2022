In an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, Trump said he thinks the 3.4 percent figure is a \u201cfalse number.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cPublic health experts have noted the WHO\u2019s estimate may change as more is learned about the spread of the virus; thousands of non-fatal cases likely have gone undetected,\u201d Kenen writes. \u201cBut while the death rate may dip below 3.4 percent, everything that\u2019s known so far suggests it won\u2019t plummet to a level that\u2019s not alarming. And it\u2019s already hitting some populations, like the elderly, disproportionately hard.\u201d (It should be noted that Trump\u2019s questioning of the 3.4 rate was simply a reference to an opinion voiced by the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci.)\n\nWhen it comes to the outbreak\u2019s seriousness, White House officials \u201chave been all over the place,\u201d according to Kenen. \u201cThe president has accused Democrats and the media of hyping the virus \u2014 one that\u2019s killed thousands worldwide \u2014 to hurt his reelection prospects, calling the criticism \u2018their new hoax,'\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd he\u2019s repeatedly hinted that a vaccine is coming soon, despite being told directly and repeatedly that in the most optimistic scenario it\u2019s at least a year away.\u201d\n\nExperts are calling the mixed messaging a \u201ccommunications nightmare\u201d for health officials, and making matters worse, that mixed messaging is coming from an administration that has a history of denying science \u2014 and now thanks to Trump, they have to worry about how talking about the crisis will affect the stock market.\n\n\u201cScientists who contradict Trump sometimes run into a buzz saw \u2014 or in the case of Trump\u2019s false predictions on Hurricane Dorian last fall, pressure to walk back the facts.\u201d\n\nRead Kenen\u2019s full piece over at POLITICO.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Sky Palma", "Brad Reed", "Travis Gettys", "Pro Publica"], "publish_date": "Thu Mar  5 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fav-1.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/trump-afp-1.jpg", "url": "https://www.rawstory.com/2020/03/trumps-erratic-messaging-on-coronavirus-is-creating-a-communications-nightmare-for-health-officials-report/", "title": "Trump\u2019s erratic messaging on coronavirus is creating a \u2018communications nightmare\u2019 for health officials: report", "description": "According to POLITICO\u2019s Joanne Kenen, when it comes to the coronavirus, President Trump \u201cis using his metaphorical black Sharpie to draw his own mental map\u201d of the growing crisis, and it\u2019s making the work of health officials much more difficult.
