Switch between tabs (Main Color, Background, My Messages) to see how deep this rabbit hole goes:\n\nOnce you\u2019re done editing, you can quickly share the result of your work with friends so that they can continue tuning your theme.\n\nTelegram bundled dozens of cool patterns to make it easy to get started and also a large number of predefined color schemes for Telegram\u2019s default themes.\n\nSend When Online\n\nTelegram has also added schedule messages to be sent when your recipient comes online. The option is only available if you are allowed to see your recipient\u2019s online status.\n\nImproved Venue Sharing\n\nLocation sharing has been updated to make finding venues easier. You can now tap a place directly on the map to select it, rather than scrolling through a list of all the available venues.\n\nView Search Results as a List\n\nThe Search function allows you to easily jump between messages containing a keyword \u2013 or sent by a particular person, or even from a certain day. Tapping the bottom bar will now switch to list view in case you want to see all the results on one page.\n\nOn iOS, you can now also select several messages without leaving Search Mode.\n\nPodcast and Audiobook Support\n\nYou\u2019ve always been able to share files of up to 1,5 GB, but podcasts and audiobooks now get special treatment. Telegram apps will remember your last position when resuming playback of audio files longer than 20 minutes.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to make podcasts get to the point a little faster, try the new 2x button (which you already know from voice messages) that eliminates voice chipmunking in 96.8% of cases.\n\nOn iOS, you can skip forward and back with high-precision scrubbing: just hold on the progress bar and slide your finger down, then left or right.\n\nNew On Android\n\nSwitch to Night Mode Faster\n\nTelegram has shielded your eyes in dark places with Night Mode since 2017. With the Night Mode Switch at the top of the menu you can tap the moon icon switch in and out of night mode faster.\n\nMaps now also support Night Mode, so you don\u2019t accidentally burn yourself while browsing locations late in the evening.\n\nOn iOS, dark maps turn on and off with the system dark mode. Speaking of which, we recently added the option to sync your Telegram theme with system dark mode on iOS 13. The app now also includes Sleek New Animations.\n\nSelect Parts of Messages\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the iOS app, Android now also lets you select a portion of the message text to copy or share, instead of only the full text.\n\nMulti-sharing from Other Apps\n\nTelegram has made it easier than ever to share content from other apps with your friends. You can now tap and hold to select multiple recipients \u2013 and even add a comment.\n\nMark Archive as Read\n\nClear up those extra unread message counters in your archive by tapping and holding the archive folder and marking them all read.\n\nOther Android Goodies\n\nYou can choose video quality in a more intuitive way when sending videos.\n\nSending contacts now uses a simple, card-style interface that won\u2019t take up your whole screen (unless you pull up to expand it).\n\nWhen you\u2019re done listening to a voice message with your phone up to your ear, Telegram automatically records a reply \u2013 but now you can disable that by turning off Raise to Speak in your Chat Settings.\n\nThere is an additional 31 other fixes and improvements in the Android app.\n\nNew on iOS\n\nText Size, All the Way\n\nYou\u2019ve been able to adjust the size of message text on Telegram from the beginning, but now you can scale the font size throughout the app.\n\nChoose Your Browser\n\nExternal browsers are now supported for opening links \u2013 you can select your preferred app in Settings > Data and Storage > Other.\n\nShare Sheet Settings\n\nYour most popular Telegram chats were recently added to the iOS Share Sheet. In case you\u2018d like to control what can (or can\u2019t ) appear there, you can use the new toggles under Settings > Data and Storage > Other > Share Sheet.\n\nSwitch Accounts Faster\n\nYou can use Telegram with multiple accounts, switching between up to 3 phone numbers without logging out. You can now swiftly switch accounts right from your home screen on iOS 13. Simply hold down on the app icon any time you need to change costumes.\n\nStorage Usage At a Glance\n\nThe Storage Usage page has been redesigned to more quickly find the settings you\u2018re looking for. It also shows your device\u2019s storage status, and how much space all those other pesky apps are using compared to Telegram.\n\nCache-Clearing Shortcuts\n\nSelecting multiple messages in a group or channel gives you the option to clear the chat\u2019s cache.\n\nCheck out Settings > Data and Storage > Storage Usage for more options.\n\nMember Lists: The Shorter Scrolls\n\nLong member lists will collapse, so you can get to the \u2018Leave Group\u2019 button without scrolling.\n\nAlternatively, swiping on a group or channel from the chat list and selecting \u2018Delete\u2019 is even quicker.\n\nFind the latest download links at Telegram here.\n\nVia Neowin", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["telegram"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 20:00:52 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/wp-content/themes/shunno/inc/assets/logos/android-chrome-48x48-min.png", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Telegram release a major update for the new year (changelog) - MSPoweruser", "description": "Privacy-focussed messaging app Telegram has released a new update for the new year.
