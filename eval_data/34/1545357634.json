The decision was made merely out of an abundance of caution, according to the company, which indicates that it\u2019ll eventually reinstate these user accounts. The decision appears to have been made so that potential symptoms have time to appear.\n\nThe full nature of the novel coronavirus behind an outbreak in Wuhan, China, isn\u2019t yet known. At this point in time, scientists have warned that the virus may be infectious during a two week period before symptoms appear, meaning patients may spread the virus to others before they discover that they\u2019re infected.\n\nJust how easily the infection can be spread from one person to another who is merely in the same general vicinity isn\u2019t clear. However, officials are exercising ample caution at airports and other facilities to ensure the virus doesn\u2019t cause any outbreaks elsewhere. That caution appears to have extended to Uber.\n\nBloomberg reports that Uber suspended the user accounts in Mexico and that the company is working with Mexican authorities on the matter. There haven\u2019t been any confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in Mexico, but one driver reportedly had transported an infected person from Los Angeles. It\u2019s unclear how the other driver was exposed to the patient, though it likely happened on a second trip.\n\nNone of the riders who had taken trips with these exposed drivers have developed any symptoms related to the disease, though based on the incubation period, there are still a few days of waiting at least before any symptoms are likely to appear. The Health Ministry in Mexico plans to monitor the cases for 14 days.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Business", "Transportation", "uber"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Feb  4 00:39:20 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Uber in Mexico has suspended 240 rider accounts after the users took rides with two different drivers who had been in contact with someone who potentially had", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Uber in Mexico has suspended 240 rider accounts after the users took rides with two different drivers who had been in contact with someone who potentially had", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Uber in Mexico suspends dozens of rider accounts over coronavirus fear", "url": "https://www.slashgear.com/uber-in-mexico-suspends-dozens-of-rider-accounts-over-coronavirus-fear-03608353/", "description": "Uber in Mexico has suspended 240 rider accounts after the users took rides with two different drivers who had been in contact with someone who potentially had coronavirus, according to a new report\u2026", "site_name": "SlashGear", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/uber_driving_Car-Main_uns.jpg", "width": 1397, "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-04T00:39:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-04T00:39:20+00:00"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@slashgear", "site": "@slashgear", "text": {"title": "Uber in Mexico suspends dozens of rider accounts over coronavirus fear"}, "image": "https://www.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/uber_driving_Car-Main_uns.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.slashgear.com/uber-in-mexico-suspends-dozens-of-rider-accounts-over-coronavirus-fear-03608353/"}
