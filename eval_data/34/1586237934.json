They fight the devastating neoliberal \u201cdevelopment\u201d and \u201cmega-projects\u201d that loot resources and land from indigenous communities and threaten forms of life that have survived despite 500 years of colonization.\n\nThe resistance shares many of the principles and goals of the Zapatistas: autonomy from the capitalist economy, communalist self-government rooted in indigenous collective traditions, an end to the subordination of women and a respectful, life-affirming, non-dominating relation to nature. Indigenous women are at the forefront of many of these ongoing struggles.\n\nIn this sixth dispatch of the series, we are introduced to the farming community of Candelaria, Chiapas, which includes many Zapatista sympathizers. The community has been under siege by an armed group invading their lands. As the community organized to protect their fields, they sought help from DESMI (a group that promotes autonomy, agroecology and women\u2019s rights).\n\nDESMI offered workshops to the women, and from this the women began to organize autonomously, transforming their daily lives. Now, they say, they can no longer live with a boss who makes all the decision. In this short they prepare chorizo and talk about their transformation.\n\nDispatches from resistant Mexico", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Caitlin Manning", "Joe Bender"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Women from Candelaria in Chiapas, Mexico, explain how they took back control over their own lives and have collectively achieved social and economic", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://roarmag.org/wp-content/themes/roar-theme/images/favicons/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#b91d47", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "Women from Candelaria in Chiapas, Mexico, explain how they took back control over their own lives and have collectively achieved social and economic", "fb": {"admins": 512524174}, "og": {"site_name": "ROAR Magazine", "title": "The Women of Candelaria", "description": "Women from Candelaria in Chiapas, Mexico, explain how they took back control over their own lives and have collectively achieved social and economic independence.", "type": "article", "url": "https://roarmag.org/films/the-women-of-candelaria/", "image": "https://roarmag.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Women-of-Candelaria.png"}, "article": {"publisher": "ROAR Magazine", "author": "Joe Bender"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "ROAR_Magazine", "title": "The Women of Candelaria", "description": "Women from Candelaria in Chiapas, Mexico, explain how they took back control over their own lives and have collectively achieved social and economic independence.", "url": "https://roarmag.org/films/the-women-of-candelaria/", "image": "https://roarmag.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Women-of-Candelaria.png"}}, "canonical_link": "https://roarmag.org/films/the-women-of-candelaria/"}
