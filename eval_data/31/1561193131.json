The benefit of immunisation is that your child has the best possible protection against dangerous diseases. This can give you peace of mind.\u201d\n\nFor further information visit nhsinform.scot/healthy-living/immunisation/why-immunise/benefits-of-immunisation.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Mar 27 12:40:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "WEST Dunbartonshire\u2019s deputy director of public health is urging local parents to continue to immunise their children.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/resources/images/4411812/", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "OMG-Verify-V1": "4389-366acdfc-5224-4c07-bb70-f74d8fbfc2db", "og": {"url": "https://www.dumbartonreporter.co.uk/news/18339895.immunisation-continues-protect-diseases/", "site_name": "Dumbarton and Vale of Leven Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.dumbartonreporter.co.uk/resources/images/11200150/", "width": 1000, "height": 1000}, "title": "Parents urged to continue to immunise their children", "type": "website", "name": "Parents urged to continue to immunise their children", "description": "WEST Dunbartonshire\u2019s deputy director of public health is urging local parents to continue to immunise their children."}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.dumbartonreporter.co.uk/resources/images/11200150/"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Parents urged to continue to immunise their children", "description": "WEST Dunbartonshire\u2019s deputy director of public health is urging local parents to continue to immunise their children."}, "fb": {"app_id": 1931217277102933, "pages": 125834953798}, "medium": "news", "title": "Parents urged to continue to immunise their children", "description": "WEST Dunbartonshire\u2019s deputy director of public health is urging local parents to continue to immunise their children."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.dumbartonreporter.co.uk/news/18339895.immunisation-continues-protect-diseases/"}
