This financial instrument gives the executive the opportunity to spend an extra \u20ac6.000 million (a fiscal imbalance of 1.8% of Spain\u2019s GDP) in 2020, compared with 2.5% in 2019.\n\nThe decision was made possible thanks to the abstention of the ERC (Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, Republican Left of Catalonia), a Catalan separatist party.\n\nThe approval of the budget ceiling is the most tangible result of the meeting (on Monday 24) of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and key members of his cabinet with separatist Catalan president Quim Torra, to discuss the crisis between the central government and the regional government (Generalitat) dominated by separatist political forces that want to secede from the rest of Spain.\n\nDialogue within the framework of the Constitution\n\nTorra and Catalan separatists parties wanted the meeting to be a tangible example of a new era of \u201cpolitical dialogue\u201d between Madrid and Catalonia, in \u2013 as they describe it \u2013 a path towards the future \u201cindependence\u201d of Catalonia.\n\nHowever, the Spanish executive stressed that the \u201cMesa de Di\u00e1logo\u201d (Dialogue Table) has no kind of \u201cnegotiating\u201d mandate and will always remain within the legal limits of the Spanish Constitution (1978), while conservative forces headed by the Partido Popular (PP, Popular Party) fiercely criticized the move.\n\nS\u00e1nchez reiterated on Wednesday the main \u201cred lines\u201d, and rejected the option of \u201cself-determination\u201d for Catalonia, EFE reported.\n\nAfter three hours of discussions at the Moncloa Palace (where the Spanish executive has it seat), both parties stated in a press release that the meeting was positive, and agreed to continue their contacts to tackle the \u201cpolitical nature of the conflict\u201d, and find a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d to it.\n\nA \u201cState summit\u201d S\u00e1nchez-Torra?\n\nThe leader of the conservative Partido Popular (PP), Pablo Casado, said the first meeting S\u00e1nchez-Torra had the \u201cappearance of a State summit\u201d, due to the presence of several ministers of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s and Torra\u2019s executives.\n\n\u201cWe will never accept a policy of \u2018faits accomplis\u2019 that go beyond the democratic framework (the Spanish Constitution)\u201d, Casado stressed, and blamed the government for accepting the \u201cblackmailing\u201d of Catalan separatists.\n\nMeanwhile, the leader of Unidas Podemos and Minister of Social Rights, Pablo Iglesias, had to cancel his participation due to heavy tonsillitis, EFE reported. Iglesias is one of the most prominent advocates of establishing a permanent \u201cdialogue\u201d with Catalonia.\n\nAccording to data from a poll published in July 2019 by the \u201cCentros de Estudios de Opini\u00f3n\u201d (CEO) of the Generalitat (the \u201cCatalan barometer\u201d) around 44% of Catalans are in favor of independence, compared with 48.3% who are against it. This is the lowest figure of pro-independence supporters in the last two years, El Pais reported.\n\nIn a speech in the Spanish Congress on Monday morning, S\u00e1nchez defended the need for dialogue with Torra: \u201cHopefully it will bear fruit for the necessary reunion between Catalans\u201d, he stressed.\n\nBut despite the good will of the Government, S\u00e1nchez admitted that the dialogue between Madrid and the Generalitat will be \u201cdifficult, long and complex\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Laura Borr\u00e1s, spokeswoman for Junts per Catalunya in the Spanish Parliament, stressed that there will be no solution for the \u201cpolitical crisis\u201d in Catalonia \u201cwithout ballot boxes (elections)\u201d, she said, referring to the need for a referendum to decide on Catalonia\u2019s self-determination, one of the key demands by separatist forces.\n\nAccording to an online poll by Catalan daily La Vanguardia published on Monday, almost 85% of readers, think the \u201cMesa de Di\u00e1logo\u201d won\u2019t produce concrete results.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic and Benjamin Fox]", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Feb 28 13:51:57 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Spanish left-wing coalition government on Thursday (27 February) scored its first major political success, after the Parliament in Madrid approved the expenditure ceiling, a preliminary step for approving the new budget for the four-year legislature, EURACTIV's partner EuroEFE reports.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/themes/euractiv_com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 5.5.3", "wp-parsely_version": "2.3", "robots": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot-news": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "description": "The Spanish left-wing coalition government on Thursday (27 February) scored its first major political success, after the Parliament in Madrid approved the expenditure ceiling, a preliminary step for approving the new budget for the four-year legislature, EURACTIV's partner EuroEFE reports.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Catalan separatists pave the way for Spain\u2019s future 'progressive' budget", "description": "The Spanish left-wing coalition government on Thursday (27 February) scored its first major political success, after the Parliament in Madrid approved the expenditure ceiling, a preliminary step for approving the new budget for the four-year legislature, EURACTIV's partner EuroEFE reports.", "image": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/Pedro-Sanchez-EU-flag-800x450.jpg"}, "og": {"title": "Catalan separatists pave the way for Spain\u2019s future 'progressive' budget", "url": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/catalan-separatists-pave-the-way-for-spains-future-progressive-budget/", "type": "article", "site_name": "www.euractiv.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/Pedro-Sanchez-EU-flag-800x450.jpg", "alt": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/catalan-separatists-pave-the-way-for-spains-future-progressive-budget/"}, "description": "The Spanish left-wing coalition government on Thursday (27 February) scored its first major political success, after the Parliament in Madrid approved the expenditure ceiling, a preliminary step for approving the new budget for the four-year legislature, EURACTIV's partner EuroEFE reports."}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-28 13:51:57", "author": "Fernando Heller", "section": "The Capitals", "tag": "Spain"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/ea_favicon_16x16.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/catalan-separatists-pave-the-way-for-spains-future-progressive-budget/"}
