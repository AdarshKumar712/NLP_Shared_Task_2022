Now, that\u2019s not surprising, as both players have plenty of tattoos covering their bodies.\n\nHowever, these weren\u2019t just any tattoos.\n\nBoth players appear to have paid tribute to Kobe Bryant. The former Lakers great died tragically over the weekend along with his daughter, Gianna, and seven other people in a helicopter accident.\n\nJames and AD wasted no time showing their respect for the Black Mamba, going with snake tattoos in honor of Kobe.\n\nEarlier this week, LeBron posted a lengthy message for Kobe, just days after passing him on the all-time scoring list.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Not Ready but here I go. Man I sitting here trying to write something for this post but every time I try I begin crying again just thinking about you, niece Gigi and the friendship/bond/brotherhood we had!\u201d James said on the post.\n\n\u201cI literally just heard your voice Sunday morning before I left Philly to head back to LA. Didn\u2019t think for one bit in a million years that would be the last conversation we\u2019d have. WTF!! I\u2019m heartbroken and devastated my brother!! Man I love you big bro. My heart goes to Vanessa and the kids. I promise you I\u2019ll continue your legacy man! You mean so much to us all here especially #LakerNation and it\u2019s my responsibility to put this shit on my back and keep it going!! Please give me the strength from the heavens above and watch over me! I got US here! There\u2019s so much more I want to say but just can\u2019t right now because I can\u2019t get through it! Until we meet again my brother!! #Mamba4Life #Gigi4Life.\u201d\n\nWe have no doubt LeBron will live up to the legacy Kobe left.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Andrew Mccarty"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan 30 23:28:36 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James appears to have gotten a tattoo in honor of Kobe Bryant.
