This due to increasing new contagion in the area.\n\nThe number of positive cases have been steadily rising since the Health Minister, Ma\u00f1alich, threw all pulmonary infections into the same basket on May 5.\n\nThe amount of street protests continue, but the police have gone from clashing with protesters to emphathizing with them, and even having their pictures taken alongside them. They seem to have listened to the common voice of the people: \u201cWe are not afraid of the virus, we are afraid of hunger.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["coronavirus", "Santiago", "Chile", "The Santiago Times", "Chile News", "COVID-19"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "This turning point will hopefully become a trend, and thereby alleviate the lives of Chileans, that have now reached 9% unemployment due to the virus.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://santiagotimes.cl/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cropped-download-1-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 191166647753240}, "google-site-verification": "u8-8NHNs1KaAXz-1Q9vNPwdpmjP-JDcaLzfFWOl7tPQ", "p": {"domain_verify": "81f169b13822dc856be311589eb9ffff"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "This turning point will hopefully become a trend, and thereby alleviate the lives of Chileans, that have now reached 9% unemployment due to the virus.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Turning the Corner Just in Time - Chile News | Breaking News, Views, Analysis", "description": "This turning point will hopefully become a trend, and thereby alleviate the lives of Chileans, that have now reached 9% unemployment due to the virus.", "url": "https://santiagotimes.cl/en/2020/05/29/turning-the-corner-just-in-time/", "site_name": "Chile News | Breaking News, Views, Analysis", "image": {"identifier": "https://santiagotimes.cl/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID_19_Cases_Worldwide.png", "width": 822, "height": 524}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheSantiagoTimes/", "published_time": "2020-05-29T20:24:56+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.9.0", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://santiagotimes.cl/2020/05/29/turning-the-corner-just-in-time/?ia_markup=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://santiagotimes.cl/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cropped-download-1-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://santiagotimes.cl/en/2020/05/29/turning-the-corner-just-in-time/"}
