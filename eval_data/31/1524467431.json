Reaching the peak refers to accumulated cases or new cases,\u201d the expert said, noting the number should peak in late February.\n\nZhong noted that if the problem in Wuhan is solved by separating healthy people from patients and dealing with a significant number of suspected patients, it would have a positive influence nationwide.\n\nHubei Province reported 1,933 new infections on Sunday, with cases in Wuhan reaching 1,690.
