It is the second highest in a three-tier system that is part of a new government plan launched on Saturday to respond to infectious diseases of unknown cause.\n\nThe city's health department added an additional thermal imaging system at Hong Kong's airport on Friday to check the body temperature of arriving passengers. More staff have been assigned for temperature checks at the West Kowloon high-speed rail station that connects Hong Kong to the mainland.\n\nCountries, such as Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam, are also carrying out temperature screening on passengers arriving from Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province.\n\nHong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, on a visit to the West Kowloon train station on Friday to review the health surveillance measures, urged any travellers who develop respiratory symptoms to wear surgical masks, seek medical attention and let doctors know where they have been.\n\nThe Wuhan health commission said 11 of the 44 people diagnosed with the pneumonia were in critical condition as of Friday. All were being treated in isolation and 121 others who had been in close contact with them were under observation.\n\nMost of the cases have been traced to the South China Seafood City food market in the suburbs of sprawling Wuhan, where offerings reportedly include wild animals that can carry viruses dangerous to humans. The commission said the market has been disinfected.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["CHINA", "DISEASES", "HONG KONG"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Jan  4 10:57:26 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Five possible cases have been reported of a viral pneumonia that has also infected at least 44 people in Wuhan.\n.
