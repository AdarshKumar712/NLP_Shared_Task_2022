Nominate a Health Care Hero by emailing Rebecca.Mullins@coxinc.com.\n\nName: Jeanee Kizer\n\nHometown (where you live now): Urbana\n\nJob title: Nurse Manager, Medical/Surgical Unit\n\nWhere do you work: Mercy Health \u2013 Springfield Regional Medical Center\n\nCOMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nDescribe what your day is like/what you do: I manage our medical/surgical unit at Springfield Regional. I oversee approximately 40 nurses and nursing assistants. I work with a wonderful group of people, and together we make a great team and work family. My work day varies from day to day. Some days I get time in the office to focus on education for my staff, schedules and the different areas of need for our unit. Other days, I am out on the floor working side by side with my staff helping in any way that I may be needed.\n\nWhat inspired you to get into health care? I became a nurse because I have an innate ability to care and provide for people. I am a caregiver. Nurses provide compassion, courage, strength, education, knowledge and kindness to those who need it most. It is the most rewarding profession.\n\nHealth Care Hero: \u2018I became a nurse to make a difference\u2019\n\nWhat\u2019s a memorable experience you\u2019ve had in health care? This year has been a memorable year for me, so far! We have obviously heard endlessly of COVID-19 and how it is affecting our health care systems, communities and our day-to-day life. It has truly been an honor to witness those I work with and those in my personal life step up during this scary time and volunteer their help. My sister-in-law made approximately 50 masks that she donated for use at the hospital. My husband\u2019s coworkers have offered to help with our children should we be exposed to the virus. I have witnessed nurses, techs and physicians volunteer to work directly with patients ill with coronavirus. My boss Debi has worked countless hours, along with other department directors and administrators, to plan and prepare for COVID-19. I am truly humbled to witness how we have come together at Springfield Regional Medical Center to fight COVID-19 and get through this time of uncertainty. This will definitely be a remembered year in my nursing career and it is truly \u201cyear of the nurse.\u201d\n\nHealth Care Hero: \u2018I really love my job\u2019\n\nWhat do you want readers to know about your job right now? I am happy to have a job. I am glad that I can continue to work and provide for my family. I am honored to work with so many great people at Springfield Regional. We are all working together to get the job done. We have an awesome team and great support! We are all heroes!\n\nThank you for reading the Dayton Daily News and for supporting local journalism.
