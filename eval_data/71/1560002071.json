Figures on tests remain as of the 24-hour period from 9am that day.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Mar 26 19:20:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Chanceller Rishi Sunak has announced a \u00a39 billion package of support to give self-employed people up to \u00a32,500 a month to help them cope with the\u2026", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/resources/images/1793277/", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "OMG-Verify-V1": "4389-366acdfc-5224-4c07-bb70-f74d8fbfc2db", "og": {"url": "https://www.stalbansreview.co.uk/news/18338231.government-pay-self-employed-80-per-cent-income-2-500-month/", "site_name": "St Albans & Harpenden Review", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.stalbansreview.co.uk/resources/images/11199894/", "width": 2400, "height": 1704}, "title": "Government to pay self-employed up to 80 per cent of their income up to \u00a32,500 a month", "type": "website", "name": "Government to pay self-employed up to 80 per cent of their income up to \u00a32,500 a month", "description": "Chanceller Rishi Sunak has announced a \u00a39 billion package of support to give self-employed people up to \u00a32,500 a month to help them cope with the\u2026"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.stalbansreview.co.uk/resources/images/11199894/"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Government to pay self-employed up to 80 per cent of their income up to \u00a32,500 a month", "description": "Chanceller Rishi Sunak has announced a \u00a39 billion package of support to give self-employed people up to \u00a32,500 a month to help them cope with the\u2026"}, "fb": {"app_id": 193833637304823, "pages": 210987985636614}, "medium": "news", "title": "Government to pay self-employed up to 80 per cent of their income up to \u00a32,500 a month", "description": "Chanceller Rishi Sunak has announced a \u00a39 billion package of support to give self-employed people up to \u00a32,500 a month to help them cope with the\u2026"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/18338231.government-pay-self-employed-80-per-cent-income-2-500-month/"}
