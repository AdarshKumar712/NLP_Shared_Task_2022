our dependence on imports,\u2019\u2019 said German Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, Peter Altmaier, when handing over the first notice of funding for fleece production.\n\nInnovatec would invest more than 11 million euros ($12.5 million) in two new units for fleece production and could manufacture an additional 1,500 tons of fleece in the future, enabling the production of more than 1.5 billion face masks, according to BMWi.\n\nThe programme was aiming to stimulate an additional fleece production of 4,000 tons per year.\n\nHowever, Altmaier stressed that \u201cour long-term goal is to cover the entire value chain, from machines to filter fleece and protective masks\u2019\u2019.\n\nRelated", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Fleece", "German government", "Face
