Not quite 20 miles farther east, near Grand Island, another trooper deployed stop sticks, bringing the car to a halt.\n\nThe teen was taken into custody, issued a number of traffic citations and returned to the Kearney youth center.\n\nThree other male juveniles who also escaped remain at large. Anyone with information on their whereabouts should contact Kearney Police at 308-237-2104, the Buffalo County Sheriff\u2019s Office at 308-236-8555 or the Nebraska State Patrol Troop C at 308-385-6000. \u2014 Nancy Gaarder\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!
