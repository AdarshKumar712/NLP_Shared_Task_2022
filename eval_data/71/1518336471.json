It is withholding the name of the woman accusing Weinstein of raping her in 2013 because it isn\u2019t clear if she wishes to be identified publicly.\n\nThe judge is expected to instruct jurors not to view Weinstein\u2019s decision not to testify as a sign of guilt.\n\n\u201cI am not a fan of blowing the lead if I feel like we are already on a road to victory,\u201d said Brian McMonagle, a defense lawyer not involved in the case who helped secure a mistrial in Bill Cosby\u2019s first sexual assault trial in 2017.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, it is an easy decision because the client either can\u2019t provide a credible explanation or you simply do not believe your client could survive cross examination because of any number or reasons.\u201d\n\nWeinstein has been increasingly upbeat coming and going from court as the trial has worn on, though in front of jurors he has mostly been sitting quietly at the defense table, munching on mints, jotting notes and occasionally dozing off.\n\nOn Monday, after strong testimony from a defense witness who repudiated the account of one of Weinstein\u2019s accusers, his lawyer Arthur Aidala declared: \u201cIt was a great day for the defense today.\u201d\n\nClaudia Salinas, a Mexican model and actress, took the stand to defend herself against accuser Lauren Marie Young\u2019s claim that she stood by and did nothing while Weinstein sexually assaulted Young at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2013.\n\n\u201cNever happened,\u201d Salinas told jurors.\n\nYoung, a model, testified last week that Salinas closed the door behind her and Weinstein as they went into the bathroom, where she alleges he stripped off his clothes, grabbed her breast and masturbated.\n\nOnce it was over, Young said she found Salinas standing outside the bathroom and shot her an evil look before leaving as quickly as she could.\n\n\u201cIf I had done that, I would remember that,\u201d Salinas testified. \u201cI would never close the door on anybody.\u201d\n\nSalinas took the witness stand as the defense called witnesses for a third day after more than two weeks of prosecution testimony.\n\nIn some other high-profile sex crimes cases, defendants have skipped testifying.\n\nFor example, Cosby did not take the witness stand either time he was tried for drugging and molesting a woman at his suburban Philadelphia home. The second trial, in 2018, resulted in the comedian\u2019s conviction.\n\nIn another high-profile case, former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was eager to testify at his 2012 child sexual abuse. But that was before his adopted son lodged allegations of abuse against him as the trial was going on. If Sandusky had testified, prosecutors could\u2019ve then called the son as a rebuttal witness.\n\n\u201cI tell my clients once you take the stand you have lost your shield, which is me, and you are on your own,\u201d said McMonagle, who was not involved in Sandusky case.\n\n\u201cIn my experience as a prosecutor and defense attorney it is rare to see a client take the stand. The problem is, some jurors do hold that against you.\u201d\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\u00ab Previous\n\nNext \u00bb", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Police Logs"], "authors": ["Email Writer"], "publish_date": "Tue Feb 11 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Weinstein is charged with raping a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex in 2006 on a different woman.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/06/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "description": "Weinstein is charged with raping a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex in 2006 on a different woman.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Defense rests without Weinstein testifying at rape trial", "description": "Weinstein is charged with raping a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex in 2006 on a different woman.", "url": "https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/02/11/defense-rests-without-weinstein-testifying-at-rape-trial/", "site_name": "Kennebec Journal and Morning Sentinel", "updated_time": "2020-02-11T19:12:31-05:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/Sexual_Misconduct_Weinstein_92687.jpg", "secure_url": "https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/Sexual_Misconduct_Weinstein_92687.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 667}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mainenewspaper", "section": "Arts & Entertainment", "published_time": "2020-02-11T16:52:06-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-11T19:12:31-05:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Weinstein is charged with raping a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex in 2006 on a different woman.", "title": "Defense rests without Weinstein testifying at rape trial - CentralMaine.com", "image": "https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/Sexual_Misconduct_Weinstein_92687.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.pressherald.com/2020/02/11/defense-rests-without-weinstein-testifying-at-rape-trial/"}
