After a long tariff \u201cwar,\u201d he won an agreement with Beijing this week to better protect foreign patents in China.\n\nIn 2019, young people in Hong Kong took to the streets to preserve the territory\u2019s legacy of rule of law from the kind of arbitrary law enforcement practiced in China. So far, they have won.\n\nNow in 2020, it is Indonesia\u2019s turn.\n\nIn early January, after dozens of Chinese fishing vessels and three Chinese coast guard vessels invaded Indonesia\u2019s maritime economic zone \u2013 violating the 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea treaty \u2013 President Joko Widodo went into action. He deployed naval ships and F-16s to the North Natuna Sea to confront China over its intrusion. He visited the area and boarded one of the warships. After a tense standoff between the two forces, the Chinese flotilla withdrew.\n\nWhile China has intruded on the waters \u2013 and even islands \u2013 of other Southeast Asian nations, nothing has been quite as dramatic as this incident. Indonesia, the world\u2019s fourth most populous country, now seems more determined than ever to stand up for rule of law on the high seas, and for good reason. With more than 13,000 islands, it is the world\u2019s largest archipelagic nation. It depends on other nations to honor its territorial integrity for the welfare of its shipping and fishing.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

It has also invited Japan, South Korea, and the United States to invest in its fishing industry to maintain a stronger presence around the Natuna Islands and to protect the country\u2019s sovereign rights. Japan has offered to give three surveillance ships to Indonesia.\n\nIn its maritime expansion, China often overreaches, leading to close-call confrontations over islands or waters it claims. Among other nations in the region, the best defense so far has been to insist on enforcement of international law. The Law of the Sea treaty sets rules for nations to follow. Like the U.S. and the people of Hong Kong, Indonesia has won a key battle with China over rule of law. Such victories will only help reinforce the idea of world order relying more on agreed principles than on brute force.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Christian Science Monitor", "The Monitor'S Editorial Board"], "publish_date": "Fri Jan 17 14:56:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Indonesia\u2019s protection of its waters from Chinese aggression sends yet another message to Beijing about the need for rule of law.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/extension/csm_base/design/standard/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "Indonesia\u2019s protection of its waters from Chinese aggression sends yet another message to Beijing about the need for rule of law.", "fb": {"app_id": 179793002061452, "pages": 14660729657}, "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2020/0117/A-small-victory-for-rule-of-law-in-Asia", "description": "Indonesia\u2019s protection of its waters from Chinese aggression sends yet another message to Beijing about the need for rule of law.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2020/01/1096159_1_indonesia_standard.jpg?alias=standard_900x600", "width": 900, "height": 600}, "title": "A small victory for rule of law in Asia"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2020/01/1096159_1_indonesia_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@csmonitor", "title": "A small victory for rule of law in Asia", "description": "Indonesia\u2019s protection of its waters from Chinese aggression sends yet another message to Beijing about the need for rule of law."}, "csm.image.std": "https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2020/01/1096159_1_indonesia_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "csm.image.credit": "Reuters", "csm.tags": "section-the-monitors-view,section-commentary,class-article,storysource-monitor", "csm.author": "the Monitor's Editorial Board", "csm.date": "2020-01-17", "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-17T14:56-05", "section": "The Monitor's View"}, "DC.date.issued": "2020-01-17T14:56:30-05:00", "csm.content.id": "02a3972ab36fdcf7db7394fad8a45313", "csm.content.body": "https://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2020/0117/A-small-victory-for-rule-of-law-in-Asia", "robots": "noarchive"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2020/0117/A-small-victory-for-rule-of-law-in-Asia"}
