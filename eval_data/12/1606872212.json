But asked how Berlin intended to deal with recent revelations implicating the Russians, Dr Merkel was less forthcoming. \"We always reserve the right to take measures,\" she said in Parliament, then immediately added: \"Nevertheless, I will continue to strive for a good relationship with Russia, because I believe that there is every reason to always continue these diplomatic efforts.\"\n\nGermany and Dr Merkel may be furious about what they see as the increasingly bold acts by Russian spies on German territory, which have ranged from toxic disinformation campaigns to cyber attacks and the murder of a former Chechen commander in Berlin. But even as patience with Russia's President Vladimir Putin is running thin, officials are struggling to figure out a good way to respond.\n\nIt is another chapter in a German-Russian relationship that is close but complicated and contradictory.\n\nDr Merkel has been one of the tougher leaders in Europe when it comes to Russia, demanding a strong line on maintaining economic sanctions against Moscow after the 2014 invasion of Ukraine despite some pushback in other capitals and at home. But she has also worked hard to keep the lines to Moscow open. The two countries have many economic links, not least in the energy market, and a sizeable faction in German politics believes Russia should be a primary partner.\n\nDr Merkel also needs Russia's help on several geopolitical fronts from Syria and Libya to Ukraine. On Wednesday, as the Chancellor condemned the cyber attack in Parliament, Mr Dmitry Kozak, Mr Putin's point man on Ukraine, was allowed to land in Berlin for talks despite a travel ban, illustrating the complexities in the German-Russian relationship.\n\nThe cyberhit on the Bundestag, the Lower House of Parliament, took place in May 2015.\n\nNYTIMES", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["GERMANY", "ANGELA MERKEL", "RUSSIA", "HACKING"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri May 15 05:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "BERLIN \u2022 German Chancellor Angela Merkel has used strong words to condemn an \"outrageous\" cyber attack by Russia's foreign intelligence service on Germany's Parliament as well as her personal e-mail account..
