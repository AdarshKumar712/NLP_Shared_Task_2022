The fighting created a new wave of civilians seeking refuge elsewhere in the province of Idlib or across the border. Turkey, which shares a border with Idlib, announced it was opening its borders with Europe \ufffd Greece and Bulgaria \ufffd to allow refugees through.\n\n\"What we know is that in Idlib province in the northern part, there are about 900,000 people displaced in the last few months, let's say, but in the last few days this has accelerated,\" Grandi said, adding that there were no new figures available yet.\n\nIn addition to the escalation on the ground, tensions have been mounting between Damascus and Ankara.
