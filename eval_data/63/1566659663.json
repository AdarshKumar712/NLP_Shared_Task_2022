Among these, he said that material and financial resources would be allocated to agriculture as a priority for the production of rice, plantain, beans, corn, eggs and pork.\n\n\u201cIt does not mean,\u201d he stressed, \u201cthere will be abundance, nor will the demand in these products be met, but it does concentrate the resources on these basic products for the people\u2019s food.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he said that when allocating resources, priority will be given to the producers that obtain the highest yields: \u201cWe are going to support them with the fuel that is needed for agriculture.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the fuel plan will be readjusted and that the one corresponding to the activities that are paralyzed will be reassigned to agriculture and the sugar harvest.\n\nRegarding retail commerce, he commented that basic necessities would be regulated and that in April a controlled and regulated sale of a list of food and sanitary products would be established, within the availabilities, with the aim of achieving more equitable access to the same by the population.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that \u201cnot everything can be included in the ration book,\u201d due to the limited quantity of some of them, so \u201cthere will be a combination of rationed and unrationed products, but regulated.\u201d\n\nHe assured that the basic food basket for the month of April was guaranteed, and that at the same time certain amounts of sugar, eggs and flour would be designed for self-employed workers so that they could maintain their production of bread and pastries that locally strengthen those produced by state-run centers.\n\nMeanwhile, he stressed that the available resources will be prioritized to meet the economy\u2019s plan in the production of toiletries, mainly soap, chlorine, medicinal oxygen and medicines.\n\n\u201cA group of exports will be affected, we will have less income in foreign currency, and with what we have today we must prepare to face this scenario,\u201d he stressed.\n\nRegarding investments, he said that the existing plan would be adjusted to boost resources for consumption. For this reason, he said, those that have not started or are in an initial phase of execution will be slowed down or decreased, while more advanced ones, which may conclude this year or next, will have more support.\n\nGil Fern\u00e1ndez explained that some strategic investments in execution will be maintained and prioritized, such as those related to renewable energy sources, food, the hydraulic sector, public health and the expansion of the capacity to produce cement, among others considered key for the country.\n\nLikewise, he assured that relocation and distance work will be promoted and that a survey of public services on the island was oriented to define which ones can be temporarily suspended and leave only the absolutely essential ones, in order to avoid crowds. He said that measures will be taken so that no process expires and the terms are extended as long as necessary.\n\nFinally, regarding transportation, he announced the temporary suspension of the shipment of cargo and parcels sent by people on a commercial basis.\n\nIn addition, he said that cargo and passengers will be reorganized due to the decrease in this activity, with the aim of using the most efficient equipment and paralyzing the least efficient ones.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on the population to avoid trips, interprovincial transit. Confiscations will not be applied for leaving the cargo in warehouses. There is a moratorium in this area, but at the moment it is preferable to suspend everything that is not absolutely essential. The most important thing is the people\u2019s health,\u201d he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["cuban society", "coronavirus in Cuba"], "authors": ["Oncuba Staff"], "publish_date": "Sat Mar 28 17:26:05 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "They were announced in the Mesa Redonda television program, and are related to the domestic economy, agricultural production, product distribution and transportation, among others.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://oncubanews.com/en/wp-content/themes/oncubanews-child/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "theme-color": "#00a7e4", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#00a7e4", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "#00a7e4", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "New measures announced for the coronavirus in Cuba | OnCubaNews English", "site_name": "OnCubaNews English", "description": "They were announced in the Mesa Redonda television program, and are related to the domestic economy, agricultural production, product distribution and transportation, among others.", "url": "https://oncubanews.com/en/cuba/new-measures-announced-for-the-coronavirus-in-cuba/", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/oncubanews.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/recorrido-por-la-habana-11-2.jpg?fit=750%2C500&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/oncubanews.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/recorrido-por-la-habana-11-2.jpg?fit=750%2C500&ssl=1", "width": 750, "height": 500}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-28T17:26:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-28T17:26:05+00:00", "section": "Cuba", "tag": "cuban society"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New measures announced for the coronavirus in Cuba | OnCubaNews English", "description": "They were announced in the Mesa Redonda television program, and are related to the domestic economy, agricultural production, product distribution and transportation, among others.", "url": "https://oncubanews.com/en/cuba/new-measures-announced-for-the-coronavirus-in-cuba/", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/oncubanews.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/recorrido-por-la-habana-11-2.jpg?fit=750%2C500&ssl=1"}, "description": "They were announced in the Mesa Redonda television program, and are related to the domestic economy, agricultural production, product distribution and transportation, among others.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"pages": 287207208102085}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://oncubanews.com/en/cuba/new-measures-announced-for-the-coronavirus-in-cuba/?ia_markup=1"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/oncubanews.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/isotipo.jpg?fit=250%2C250&ssl=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://oncubanews.com/en/cuba/new-measures-announced-for-the-coronavirus-in-cuba/"}
