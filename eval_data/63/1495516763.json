After getting permission from a senior officer, a 34-year-old police officer killed the gorilla with shots from his submachine gun.\n\nInvestigators believe the fire which killed dozens of animals was caused by airborne lanterns that were released by three women celebrating the new year. The lanterns, which are illegal to use in Germany, had inadvertently landed in the zoo.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["smg2_world", "smg_europe", "smg2_news"], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan 15 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "BERLIN - German authorities say a gorilla that was seriously injured in a zoo fire at New Year's had to be shot dead by a police officer after vets were unable to euthanize it.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon-thestar.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicon-thestar-144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicon-thestar-70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicon-thestar-150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicon-thestar-310.png", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=379481068", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "thestar.com", "application-name": "thestar.com", "fb": {"pages": 134392236659479}, "storyuuid": "995e12a1203b061dac9ae9bbeef03641", "description": "BERLIN - German authorities say a gorilla that was seriously injured in a zoo fire at New Year's had to be shot dead by a police officer after vets were unable to euthanize it.", "keywords": "smg2_world,smg_europe,smg2_news", "news_keywords": "smg2_world,smg_europe,smg2_news", "article": {"published": "2020-01-15", "modified": "2020-01-15", "section": "Europe"}, "og": {"title": "Germany: Gorilla injured in zoo fire shot dead by police | The Star", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/europe/2020/01/15/germany-gorilla-injured-in-zoo-fire-shot-dead-by-police.html", "description": "BERLIN - German authorities say a gorilla that was seriously injured in a zoo fire at New Year's had to be shot dead by a police officer after vets were unable to euthanize it.", "site_name": "thestar.com", "image": "https://www.thestar.com/assets/img/thestar-ribbon.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@TorontoStar", "title": "Germany: Gorilla injured in zoo fire shot dead by police | The Star", "description": "BERLIN - German authorities say a gorilla that was seriously injured in a zoo fire at New Year's had to be shot dead by a police officer after vets were unable to euthanize it.", "image": "https://www.thestar.com/assets/img/thestar-ribbon.png"}, "parsely-title": "Germany: Gorilla injured in zoo fire shot dead by police", "parsely-link": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/europe/2020/01/15/germany-gorilla-injured-in-zoo-fire-shot-dead-by-police.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://www.thestar.com/assets/img/thestar-ribbon.png", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-01-15T12:11:20.000Z", "parsely-section": "Europe", "parsely-tags": "smg2_world, smg_europe, smg2_news, word count: <350 words", "parsely-metadata": "{\"storyuuid\": \"995e12a1203b061dac9ae9bbeef03641\"}"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/europe/2020/01/15/germany-gorilla-injured-in-zoo-fire-shot-dead-by-police.html"}
