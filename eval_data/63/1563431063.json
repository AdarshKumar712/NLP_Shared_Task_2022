(He spoke to The Associated Press on condition that he be identified only by his first name and rank, in accordance with the rules of his branch of the French military.) \"Since there is no Internet, no radio and no television on board, the only news you get comes from messages received by the commander, and the commander filters the messages to not give all of the information to everyone.\"\n\nFour French ballistic submarines, laden with 16 missiles can each carry six nuclear warheads, left harbor before France instituted a nationwide lockdown on March 17.\n\nAdm. Dominique Salles, who commanded the nuclear-armed French submarine \"L'Inflexible,\" told the AP he believes submariners will likely only be told of the pandemic as they head back to port, in the final two days of their mission.\n\n\"They won't know,\" Salles said. \"The boys need to be completely available for their mission.\"\n\nFrench submarine missions last 60 to 70 days, with about 110 crew members aboard. A crew that left at the end of February wouldn't be expected back before the end of April. In that case, they will return to a world changed by the pandemic.\n\nFRANCE EVACUATES CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS FROM SWAMPED HOSPITALS USING HIGH-SPEED TRAINS, MILITARY PLANES\n\nOn March 1, France had just 130 confirmed COVID-19 cases and two deaths. In under a month, those numbers have surged to over 40,000 sickened and 2,600 dead. For submariners, the return to land will likely be a shock.\n\nSalles said the situation now will be toughest for any crews that leave harbor in the weeks ahead, because they'll know they are leaving loved ones in the midst of the pandemic and, possibly, still living in lockdown. The French government has already extended its stay-home orders once, to April 15, and said it could do so again.\n\nSalles said he believes those crews will get regular coronavirus updates but won't be told of any family deaths until they are returning to the l'Ile Longue submarine base near Brest in Brittany.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"No matter how serious an event is, there is nothing a submariner can do about it. And since he cannot do anything, better that he know nothing,\" Salles said. \"They know that they won't know and accept it. It's part of our deal.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
