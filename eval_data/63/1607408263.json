Here is the statement released via the Disney Parks Blog:\n\nAs our four theme parks prepared for a temporary closure, Disney cast members waved goodbye, wished our guests well, and promised to see everyone again real soon. As the night drew to a close at Magic Kingdom Park, one special moment saw Walt Disney World Resort President Josh D\u2019Amaro joined at the Main Street, U.S.A. train station by Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse and many of their beloved Disney pals to wave a fond farewell \u2013 for now. Here\u2019s a look at how Disney cast members across our parks said goodbye, including a special message for all our fans around the world.\n\nFurther closures, which included all Disney Resorts, Disney stores, and both Disney Springs and Downtown Disney District, were all announced shortly after the official park closures took place.\n\nWe\u2019ll be keeping our eyes on developments here in Florida and in California, as well as in Paris, and Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong regarding the COVID-19 outbreak\u2019s effect on Disney Parks operations and beyond.
