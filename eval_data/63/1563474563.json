Duchin said he felt confident saying the rate of transmission is lower than it was, but he wouldn\u2019t put much stock in the precise figure.\n\nTo see a drop in the number of new cases, the measure of transmission would have to be below 1.\n\nThere are now more than 4,850 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Washington state and at least 195 deaths, as of Sunday, March 29.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in several weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Consumer", "Mariners", "Sounders", "Personal Finance", "Mom to Mom", "Politics", "Storm", "Entertainment", "Huskies", "Reign", "Just A Bit Outside", "Economy", "Cougars", "COVID-19 and the Economy", "Healthy Living", "Watch Full Episodes", "Savings", "Commentary", "Latest from Around the World", "Coronavirus", "Bridging The Divide", "More Coronavirus News", "Kraken", "Business", "Health", "US Marshals Most Wanted", "Seahawks", "All Local", "COVID-19 Vaccine Info", "Gardening with Tim", "Driver on the Street", "World"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicons/kcpq/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//static.foxtv.com/static/orion/img/kcpq/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//static.foxtv.com/static/orion/img/kcpq/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//static.foxtv.com/static/orion/img/kcpq/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//static.foxtv.com/static/orion/img/kcpq/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "fb": {"app_id": 200814513633539}, "prism.stationId": "KCPQ_FOX13", "prism.stationCallSign": "kcpq", "prism.channel": "fts", "prism.section": "news", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Public health officer says social distancing may be working in King County", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Q13 FOX", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:a30eac9a-3ae9-5e7d-9f2d-f1fd8a4ec802", "dc.source": "Associated Press", "dc.date": "2020-03-30", "dcterms.created": "2020-03-30T13:36:20-07:00", "dcterms.modified": "2020-06-30T10:27:28-07:00", "og": {"title": "Public health officer says social distancing may be working in King County", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.q13fox.com/www.q13fox.com/content/uploads/2020/06/1280/720/gettyimages-1213760977.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "url": "https://www.q13fox.com/news/public-health-officer-says-social-distancing-may-be-working-in-king-county", "site_name": "Q13 FOX", "locale": "en_US"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "fox.app_version": "v77", "fox.app_build": "no build version", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1515636816, app-argument=https://www.q13fox.com/news/public-health-officer-says-social-distancing-may-be-working-in-king-county", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@q13fox", "id": "@q13fox"}, "title": "Public health officer says social distancing may be working in King County", "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.q13fox.com/www.q13fox.com/content/uploads/2020/06/724/407/gettyimages-1213760977.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.q13fox.com/news/public-health-officer-says-social-distancing-may-be-working-in-king-county", "creator": {"identifier": "@q13fox", "id": "@q13fox"}}, "fox.name": "Post Landing", "fox.category": "news", "fox.page_content_category": "news", "fox.page_name": "kcpq:web:post:article:Public health officer says social distancing may be working in King County", "fox.page_content_level_1": "kcpq:web:post", "fox.page_content_level_2": "kcpq:web:post:article", "fox.page_content_level_3": "kcpq:web:post:article:Public health officer says social distancing may be working in King County", "fox.page_content_level_4": "kcpq:web:post:article:Public health officer says social distancing may be working in King County", "fox.page_type": "post-article", "fox.page_content_distributor": "owned", "fox.page_content_type_of_story": "Migrated", "fox.page_content_version": "1.0.0", "fox.publisher": "Associated Press", "fox.page_content_id": "a30eac9a-3ae9-5e7d-9f2d-f1fd8a4ec802", "fox.page_content_station_originator": "kcpq", "fox.url": "https://www.q13fox.com/news/public-health-officer-says-social-distancing-may-be-working-in-king-county", "fox.page_canonical_url": "https://www.www.q13fox.com/news/public-health-officer-says-social-distancing-may-be-working-in-king-county", "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FTS/Health/Coronavirus,/FTS/News", "classification-isa": "coronavirus,news", "fox.page_content_tags": "/FTS/Health/Coronavirus,/FTS/News"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.q13fox.com/news/public-health-officer-says-social-distancing-may-be-working-in-king-county"}
