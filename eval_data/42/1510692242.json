The adolescent got pregnant at 15 years old according to public data at the national register.\n\nEarly last week, The Voice first revealed that the Prosecutor Office opened a case against N\u00fa\u00f1ez and then archived it when the victim refused to declare against him. \u201cWe had no proof to continue the investigation\u201d, they claimed through their Press Department. This happened two times last year after two different denunciations.\n\nRam\u00edrez confirmed his relationship both in social media and to the national newspaper Semanario Universidad. After the publication, his political partner and candidate for mayor for the political party Partido Integraci\u00f3n Nacional (PIN- National Integration Party) in Nicoya, Jimmy Fonseca, said he didn\u2019t know about the relationship, recognized that it is illegal but said that \u201cit is normal for these couples to start a relationship when there is love\u201d and justified that it is part of Guanacaste\u2019s customs.\n\nIn Costa Rica, it is illegal to have a relationship with anyone between ages 15-18 years if the adult is seven years older or more than the victim. According to the new law approved in 2017, it can be penalized with the jail. Same when the victim is anyone between ages 13-15 and the adult is five or more years older.\n\nRead also: The math behind illegal relationships\n\nAfter that first publication, Ram\u00edrez \u201cvoluntarily\u201d resigned from the political campaign and the Ombudsman Office asked the General Prosecutor and the National Institute for Children (PANI in Spanish) for an explanation. General Prosecutor Emilia Navas demanded that the case be reopened.\n\nNavas acknowledged that the Prosecutor\u2019s Office was wrong in the \u201capproach and resolution\u201d of the case when it asked the judges for the dismissal. She told The Voice that she herself ruled two years ago that every prosecutor should continue investigating cases in which women\u2019s lives were at risk even if the victim refused to participate or to declare.\n\nPANI also reacted to the story published by The Voice. Officials went to the teenager\u2019s house and confirmed that she had a relationship with Ram\u00edrez and that she and her baby were living a \u201crisky situation\u201d. PANI\u2019s officials took her to a temporary shelter while the investigation continues and social and legal intervention is being practiced with her family to evaluate new steps to come.\n\n\u201cShe won\u2019t stay at the shelter forever\u201d, PANI\u2019s press department clarified.\n\nAccording to PANI, the teenager\u2019s mother tried to file a complaint against Ram\u00edrez last year, but it was already under investigation. After the case was dismissed by the courts, she said she \u201cthought the relationship wasn\u2019t illegal\u201d, but a relative went to the police again and filed a new complaint. This last one was dismissed again.\n\nAt the Partido Integraci\u00f3n Nacional, Fonseca\u2019s declarations provoked national legislator Zoila Volio\u2019s resignation.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Mar\u00eda Fernanda Cruz", "Yamlek Mojica"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan 30 17:01:24 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Prosecutor Office reopens investigation against vice mayor candidate after The Voice revealed the relationship he has with a minor", "description": "The General Prosecutor Office reopened an investigation against a candidate for vice mayor for Nicoya this week after The Voice revealed that he had an illegal relationship with a 16-year-old.\u00a0 \u2026 Read more", "url": "https://vozdeguanacaste.com/en/prosecutor-office-reopens-investigation-against-vice-mayor-candidate-after-the-voice-revealed-the-relationship-he-has-with-a-minor/", "site_name": "Voz de Guanacaste", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.imghaste.com/vozdeguanacaste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/pin-32.jpg", "width": 1673, "height": 963}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/vozdeguanacaste/", "published_time": "2020-01-30T17:01:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-30T23:22:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VozdeGuanacaste", "site": "@VozdeGuanacaste", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Mar\u00eda Fernanda Cruz Chaves", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "generator": "WPML ver:4.4.10 stt:1,2;", "fb": {"app_id": 154751851981040, "admins": 10152476037299016}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin"}, "canonical_link": "https://vozdeguanacaste.com/en/prosecutor-office-reopens-investigation-against-vice-mayor-candidate-after-the-voice-revealed-the-relationship-he-has-with-a-minor/"}
