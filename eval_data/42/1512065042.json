Plot details have been kept pretty tight, but after the events of Endgame \u2014 wherein Steve Rogers hands the shield and the Captain America mantle to Sam \u2014 many wondered about what that meant for this series. Is something stopping Sam from becoming Captain America? He can certainly throw the shield.\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier actress Emily VanCamp returns for Falcon and the Winter Soldier as SHIELD Agent Sharon Carter, while Wyatt Russell makes his MCU debut as John Walker, known to comics fans as U.S. Agent. Daniel Bruh joins as Civil War foe Zemo.\n\nAfter the wave of action-filled footage, we get a small snippet of footage from Wandavision, finding Vision and Scarlet Witch back in a reality-bending drama. The couple appear to be jumping from sitcom to sitcom \u2014 Wanda gasps in the Brady Bunch house? Wanda gasps in the Brady Bunch house.\n\nWe also short line-reading from Tom Hiddleston as his Thor villain Loki, appearing in a prison outfit. Let the speculation begin.\n\nUnlike the Hulu and Netflix Marvel shows, the Disney Plus ones will actually affect the events of the movies. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier heads to Disney Plus this fall, with WandaVision following later this year.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Petrana Radulovic", "Matt Patches", "Julia Lee", "Austen Goslin", "Nicole Carpenter", "Samit Sarkar", "Feb"], "publish_date": "Sun Feb  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Disney Plus Marvel Cinematic Universe shows get a sizzle reel during the Super Bowl.
