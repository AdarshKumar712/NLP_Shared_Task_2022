While there, he began to show symptoms of COVID-19 and tested positive for the virus.But, despite the fears of his family, he recovered, and nurses at the hospital saw him off with a guard of honor \u2014 a moment that was captured on video and shared on social media by the NHS Northeast and Yorkshire health trust.\"Thank you very much, I appreciate every bit you've done for me. It couldn't have been better,\" Chambers, who has lived alone since his wife's death almost two decades ago, tells one of the nurses in the video.His grandson, 49-year-old Stephen Gater, told CNN how the family had expected the worst after being told he had contracted COVID-19. But, he said, he believed his grandfather's \"fortitude\" \u2014 gained during his time as a British Army soldier during World War II \u2014 helped pull him through.During the war, Chambers was captured by the enemy after being injured in a bomb blast in North Africa. He was transferred to Fallingbostel in northwestern Germany, where he spent three years as a prisoner of war in its Stalag XI B camp.After the war, he protected London's royal palaces as a soldier in the Coldstream Guards.\"It's nice to have some positive news in the midst of what is a difficult time for everybody,\" Gater told CNN.\"When we heard the news, we feared the worst but he's pulled through and it's amazing \u2014 the staff there are incredible and we owe them a huge amount of gratitude. We were clapping very ferociously last night at 8 o'clock along with everyone else.\"It's testament to the care he was getting and his positive attitude and his fortitude.\"One thing Chambers will have missed, Gater said, was his \"guilty secret\" \u2014 a daily trifle bought from the supermarket Marks & Spencer.\"I'm just driving up and I've literally just stopped at a service station and bought him a load \u2014 so hopefully that'll put a smile on his face,\" he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["dhnd", "coronavirus", "covid-19", "pandemic", "outbreak"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Sara Spary"], "publish_date": "Fri Apr 10 15:29:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Albert Chambers will turn 100 in July.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/htv_default_image/wpbf/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#2c2c2c", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.wpbf.com/article/99-year-old-world-war-ii-veteran-who-survived-coronavirus-gets-guard-of-honor-from-nurses/32107269", "site_name": "WPBF", "title": "99-year-old World War II veteran who survived coronavirus gets guard of honor from nurses", "description": "Albert Chambers will turn 100 in July.", "image": {"identifier": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/albert-chambers-1586531997.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.903xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 750}}, "x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=5", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.wpbf.com/article/99-year-old-world-war-ii-veteran-who-survived-coronavirus-gets-guard-of-honor-from-nurses/32107269", "site": "@WPBF25News", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "wpbf", "ipad": "wpbf"}, "id": {"iphone": 505577798, "ipad": 505577798, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wpbf"}, "url": {"iphone": "wpbf://content/32107269", "ipad": "wpbf://content/32107269", "googleplay": "wpbf://content/32107269"}}, "image": {"identifier": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/albert-chambers-1586531997.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.903xh;0,0&resize=640:*", "alt": "Albert Chambers"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "99-year-old World War II veteran who survived coronavirus gets guard of honor from nurses", "description": "Albert Chambers will turn 100 in July."}, "fb": {"app_id": 103120817217, "pages": 64713099313}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wpbf25news", "modified_time": "2020-04-10T15:28:36.151472Z", "opinion": "false", "published_time": "2020-04-10T15:29:00Z", "section": "News", "subsection": "National News", "collection": "Coronavirus"}, "google-site-verification": "8GEnNpchOqxdhf-bdP8pb9IfD-91RQJgnLcIrDRYS-Y", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=505577798, affiliate-data=1010lpJ, app-argument=canonical", "msvalidate.01": "A645064CC349FEE2894B433087AB1839", "title": "99-year-old World War II veteran who survived coronavirus gets guard of honor from nurses", "description": "Albert Chambers will turn 100 in July.", "keywords": "dhnd, coronavirus, covid-19, pandemic, outbreak", "news_keywords": "dhnd, coronavirus, covid-19, pandemic, outbreak", "sailthru.contentid": 32107269, "auto-publish": "timely", "sailthru.image.full": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/albert-chambers-1586531997.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.903xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/albert-chambers-1586531997.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.903xh;0,0&resize=50:50", "date": "2020-04-10T15:29:00Z", "datepublished": "2020-04-10T15:29:00Z", "datemodified": "2020-04-10T15:28:36.151472Z", "category": "National News", "sailthru.tags": "news,national-news,coronavirus", "parsely-link": "https://www.wdsu.com/article/99-year-old-world-war-ii-veteran-who-survived-coronavirus-gets-guard-of-honor-from-nurses/32107269"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.wpbf.com/article/99-year-old-world-war-ii-veteran-who-survived-coronavirus-gets-guard-of-honor-from-nurses/32107269"}
