He returned to Zhengzhou from Beijing by train on the same day.\n\nZhengzhou municipal government has issued rules stipulating that people who have travelled abroad must be quarantined for 14 days and report their travel history to the authorities. But Guo went to work two days after his return.\n\nOn the afternoon of March 9, he developed Covid-19 symptoms such as fever and a sore throat. He bought some medicine at a chemist without consulting a doctor.\n\nWhen police checked later if he had travelled abroad, both Guo and his mother initially tried to cover up his movements and only confessed after the officers presented evidence to show that they were lying.\n\nGuo was sent to an isolation centre and was confirmed to have contracted Covid-19 on March 11.\n\nHis was the first imported case in Henan and more than 40 people who had been in close contact with him have been placed under medical observation.\n\nGuo was indicted late last month after he recovered and was discharged from hospital. The statement did not say if his mother has been indicted.\n\nHe was among the most-viewed topics on China\u2019s social media after his case triggered outrage. People accused him of breaking the province\u2019s record of having no new confirmed patients for 12 consecutive days.\n\nHis case also forced local authorities to postpone their plan to ease restrictions on public transport, resume production and reopen schools.\n\nThe prosecutors also said a man surnamed Ding who returned from Iran in February would face trial.\n\nHe is accused of failing to report symptoms when he arrived at Shanghai Pudong airport and travelling by train to Gansu and Ningxia.\n\nAfter he was diagnosed with Covid-19, more than 200 people from three cities had to be put under quarantine as they have been in close contact with him.\n\nThe procurators said a man surnamed Hu from Linxia in Gansu would also be charged; he is accused of failing to follow quarantine procedures after travelling to Egypt.\n\nHu was subsequently confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus, leading to the isolation of around 130 people.\n\nhttps://sg.news.yahoo.com/chinese-man-jailed-breaking-quarantine-133020886.html\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory: China", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["china"], "tags": ["view all day-by-day"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A man in central China has been jailed for 18 months for travelling to Europe and breaking coronavirus quarantine rules after returning home.
