That\u2019s a big difference between those two. In either event they should have let us go in. We asked to go in early. And they didn\u2019t want us in. I think they knew it was something bad and they were embarrassed.- Donald Trump, United States President\n\nTrump also said that he was waiting to see what emerged from China\u2019s internal investigation into the outbreak. The Trump administration has said it doesn\u2019t rule out that the novel coronavirus was spread accidentally from a laboratory researching bats in Wuhan.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who had earlier alleged that the US military may have brought the virus into China, has rejected US media reports on the subject and said there is no scientific basis.\n\nWatch in Sign Language", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Apr 20 01:30:53 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://newzhook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/newzhook_icon_512x512-65x65.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#ff5500", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "US President Trump warns China over coronavirus - Newz Hook - Changing Attitudes towards Disability", "description": "United States President Donald Trump has warned that China could face consequences if it was knowingly responsible for the coronavirus pandemic.\u201dIt could have been stopped in China before it started and it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Trump told reporters at a White House briefing. \u201cAnd now the whole world is suffering because of it.\u201d Trump said this when [\u2026]", "url": "https://newzhook.com/story/us-president-trump-warns-china-over-coronavirus/", "site_name": "Newz Hook - Changing Attitudes towards Disability", "image": {"identifier": "https://newzhook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/trump_fb.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewzHook/", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shaivenkat", "published_time": "2020-04-20T01:30:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-04-20T07:45:46+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@shaivenkat", "site": "@newzhook"}, "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.8.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://newzhook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/newzhook_icon_512x512-300x300.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://newzhook.com/story/us-president-trump-warns-china-over-coronavirus/"}
