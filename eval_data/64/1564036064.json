It can cause severe pneumonia. In all, 41 cases struck China itself, including two deaths. Since the initial cases were reported on Dec. 31, 2019, little more of the virus has revealed itself. Researchers still do not know how patients were infected, whether human-to-human transmission is involved or even how the disease is being transmitted, the clinical spectrum of the disease, or the extent of infection, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe new test, however, means that while experts might not yet be able to determine where the virus came from, they can at least halt it quicker. The test is publicly available, following online publication by WHO, though a joint evaluation study is underway.\n\n\u201cNow that this diagnostic test is widely available, I expect that it won\u2019t be long before we are able to reliably diagnose suspected cases,\u201d Dr. Christian Drotsen, professor and director of the Institute of Virology on Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte, said. \u201cThis will also help scientists understand whether the virus is capable of spreading from human to human. This is an important step in our fight against this new virus.\u201d\n\nDZIF and its virus detection and preparedness group intend to increase preparedness for the emergence of new viruses, like this one.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Chris Galford", "Monday", "January"], "publish_date": "Mon Jan 20 13:00:20 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://homelandprepnews.com/wp-content/themes/biov2/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "German researchers create quick diagnostic test for Chinese coronavirus - Homeland Preparedness News", "description": "As the world researchers try to identify the cause of a mysterious, novel coronavirus from China, researchers from the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) have made headway on at least tracking its existing, with the creation of a new \u2026 Read More \u00bb", "url": "https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/42800-german-researchers-create-quick-diagnostic-test-for-chinese-coronavirus/", "site_name": "Homeland Preparedness News", "updated_time": "2020-01-20T12:55:21+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://homelandprepnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_1453789577.jpg", "secure_url": "https://homelandprepnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_1453789577.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 703}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Bioprepwatch", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-01-20T13:00:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-20T12:55:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "As the world researchers try to identify the cause of a mysterious, novel coronavirus from China, researchers from the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) have made headway on at least tracking its existing, with the creation of a new \u2026 Read More \u00bb", "title": "German researchers create quick diagnostic test for Chinese coronavirus - Homeland Preparedness News", "site": "@homelandprep", "image": "https://homelandprepnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_1453789577.jpg", "creator": "@homelandprep"}, "shareaholic": {"site_name": "Homeland Preparedness News", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/42800-german-researchers-create-quick-diagnostic-test-for-chinese-coronavirus/", "keywords": "countermeasures, emerging infectious diseases, featured, news, research, threats, post", "article_published_time": "2020-01-20T07:00:20-05:00", "article_modified_time": "2020-01-20T06:55:21-05:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_author_name": "Chris Galford", "site_id": "ee72d7d9567d7956c3b7680d498b893d", "wp_version": "8.13.1", "image": "https://homelandprepnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_1453789577-640x450.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.5"}, "canonical_link": "https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/42800-german-researchers-create-quick-diagnostic-test-for-chinese-coronavirus/"}
