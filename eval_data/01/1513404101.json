(Photo: Shutterstock)\n\nJetting off to enjoy some sun, sea and sand may be the idea of holiday bliss for many, but lounging around on a beach isn\u2019t for everyone.\n\nFor some, fun is found in much cooler climes, with adrenaline-fuelled adventures on the slopes.\n\nBut if you are a fan of ski holidays, getting to your destination with all your luggage and equipment can be costly.\n\nExpensive charges\n\nIf you are planning a trip to the slopes this ski season, it can pay to shop around before booking to avoid being stung by extra baggage charges, as some airlines charge significantly more than others.\n\nRyanair has been found to be the worst culprit for ski carriage, according to research by My Late Deals, charging \u00a345 per passenger in each direction of travel when booked in advance.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Swiss Airlines proved to be the best airline for skiers and snowboarders, allowing passengers to carry their equipment on board for free. The airline doesn\u2019t add any extra charges to passengers\u2019 baggage allowance and there is no need to book in advance.\n\nEurowings was also found to be a good option for travellers, with the airline also allowing passengers to bring their equipment for free, without taking it out of their baggage allowance.\n\nHowever, while travellers are not required to book in advance it is strongly recommended, as carriage is dependent on availability.\n\nRyanair charged passengers \u00a345 each in both directions of travel for ski carriage (Photo: Shutterstock)\n\nWhich airlines are the most expensive?\n\nThese nine airlines all charge a fee per passenger, per direction, for carrying ski equipment, and require travellers to book in advance.\n\nListed are the fees for each airline:\n\nRyanair - \u00a345.00\n\nTui - \u00a340.00 (minimum)\n\nEasyJet - \u00a337.00\n\nAer Lingus - \u20ac40.00 (approximately \u00a334)\n\nIberia (unless traveling long haul) - \u20ac40.00 (approximately \u00a334)\n\nNorwegian - \u00a330.00- \u00a335.00 on short flights. \u00a350.00 on long haul.\n\nWizz Air - \u20ac30.00 (approximately \u00a325)\n\nFlybe - \u00a330.00\n\nJet2 - \u00a330.00\n\nWhich airlines don\u2019t charge?\n\nThese airlines don\u2019t charge an additional fee for ski equipment, but do take it out of your baggage allowance:\n\nAir France\n\nAlitalia\n\nAustrian Airlines\n\nBritish Airways\n\nFinnair\n\nKLM\n\nLufthansa\n\nSAS\n\nShould I book in advance?\n\nBooking ski carriage in advance will not only save you time at the airport, but will also save you money with the majority of airlines, according to My Late Deals.\n\nFor example Aer Lingus charge a \u20ac40 fee prior to departure, or a fee of \u20ac50 payable through the Aer Lingus reservations centre at the airport on the day of departure.\n\nThe majority of airlines don\u2019t require pre booking, but there are a few that do require advance notice. Austrian, Flybe, Jet2, KLM, SAS and TUI all require ski carriage to be booked in advance.\n\nIt is also strongly advised to pre-book on Eurowings, Lufthansa and Wizzair, as ski carriage may not be guaranteed due to availability.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/img/icons/16x16.png", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#e20915", "category": "Read This", "sitename": "Portadown Times", "page path": "/news/read-this", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "title": "These are the airlines charging the most for stowing ski equipment - and the ones that don\u2019t charge", "url": "https://www.portadowntimes.co.uk/news/read-this/these-are-airlines-charging-most-stowing-ski-equipment-and-ones-dont-charge-1385717", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.portadowntimes.co.uk/images-i.jpimedia.uk/imagefetch/https://jpgreatcontent.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shutterstock_115041883.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.portadowntimes.co.uk/images-i.jpimedia.uk/imagefetch/https://jpgreatcontent.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shutterstock_115041883.jpg", "width": 960, "height": 640}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@PortadownTimes1"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.portadowntimes.co.uk/fbia/news/read-this/these-are-airlines-charging-most-stowing-ski-equipment-and-ones-dont-charge-1385717"}, "parsely-post-id": "944f27179672ad52c6f950020f6f8fbc", "fb": {"app_id": 635400790185037, "pages": 199102746767852}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.portadowntimes.co.uk/news/read-this/these-are-airlines-charging-most-stowing-ski-equipment-and-ones-dont-charge-1385717"}
