This label linked to a paragraph assuring users that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of widespread fraud connected to mail-in voting, all but suggesting that the president is lying to the American people.\n\nPredictably, this raised Trump\u2019s ire. \u201c@Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post.\u201d\n\nIn addition to sticking their noses in where they aren\u2019t wanted and don\u2019t belong, Twitter actually made a fool of themselves by trying to \u201cfact check\u201d the president.\n\nFirst of all, since this is the first tweet that they\u2019ve done this to, we assume that every single thing that Trump has written up till this Tuesday is 100% true. That certainly goes against what his critics in the mainstream media have been saying for the last four years.\n\nSecond, Twitter is endangering their status as a \u201cplatform,\u201d which gives them all kinds of liability protections that would not be available to them if they were deemed a \u201cpublisher.\u201d Right now, Twitter is exempt from defamation and libel lawsuits based on what people on their platform say. They aren\u2019t responsible for what\u2019s written there. But if they\u2019re going to wade into the fray and start labeling posts true and false, then that may change in a hurry.\n\nFinally, if Twitter is going to fact-check the President of the United States, they should probably make sure they have their facts straight. In 2005, a bipartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform found that \u201cabsentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud\u201d in the United States. Just this week, in fact, the Alabama secretary of State confirmed that 83% of the voter fraud his state has seen in the last five years has come from mail-in ballots.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s too much to ask that Twitter fact-check their fact-checks. And, to be clear, we\u2019re actually NOT asking them to do so. We\u2019d much prefer they go back to minding their own business and letting people do their own research. But if they want to take on this burden, they need to be prepared. So far, they\u2019ve only succeeded in embarrassing themselves.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://patriotnewsdaily.com/wp-content/themes/jarida/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Hey Twitter: If You\u2019re Going to Fact-Check, Get Your Facts Straight", "type": "article", "description": "On Tuesday, President Donald Trump went off on the Democrats and their attempts to turn the 2020 election into an all-mail-in affair, complete with all of", "url": "http://patriotnewsdaily.com/hey-twitter-if-youre-going-to-fact-check-get-your-facts-straight/", "site_name": "PatriotNewsDaily.com", "image": "http://patriotnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/twit.png", "locale": "en"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "fb": {"admins": 126703811068849}}, "canonical_link": "http://patriotnewsdaily.com/hey-twitter-if-youre-going-to-fact-check-get-your-facts-straight/"}
