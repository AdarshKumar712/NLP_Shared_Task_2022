We hope it'll resonate with people who feel something's been missing.\"\n\n3 Users will be limited to uploading videos no longer than six seconds \u2013 which will loop after finishing Credit: Byte\n\nIt was originally supposed to launch in spring 2019, but was delayed for unknown reasons.\n\nNow the app is free to download and is available on iPhone and Android phones.\n\nVine was founded back in June 2012, and was bought up by Twitter in October that same year \u2013 in what's believed to have been a $30million (\u00a322.9million) deal.\n\nThe app shot to popularity due to its short clips, with successful users often focusing particularly on comedy videos.\n\nIt was free to download, and was available on phones, computers and even game consoles.\n\nBut on October 27, 2016, Twitter announced that the Vine mobile app would be discontinued.\n\nIn December 2016, it was confirmed that the Vine app would remain operational, but videos would be published directly to Twitter.\n\nA month later, Vine's community website was shut down and the app was renamed to Vine Camera \u2013 which was largely deemed a flop.\n\n3 Byte was created by Vine co-founder Dom Hoffman Credit: Twitter\n\nIn January 2017, Twitter launched an archive of all Vine videos, but there was no way to upload new content to the service.\n\nMany Vine videos still prove popular on YouTube today, and there's been significant interest in a reboot of the app.\n\nBut Vine now faces stiff competition from rival app TikTok, a video app that's hugely popular with teens.\n\nByte \u2013 will it be the next hit app? Here's what industry expert Paolo Pescatore, of PP Foresight, told The Sun... \"Video is the next battle ground and is fast becoming a crowded place with too many services chasing few dollars.\n\n\"There are some opportunities to be novel that will resonate with viewers.\n\n\"Everyone wants to jump on the new thing but making money and attracting top quality content will represent the biggest test.\n\n\"For now new services need to have eyeballs and content.\"\n\nFormer Vine celebrities who have since transferred to TikTok are already turning up on Byte too.\n\nThey include Lance Stewart, Chris Melberger and Josh Darnit.\n\nThese online stars are likely attracted by the fact that Byte has vowed to start paying creators immediately \u2013 despite having only just launched.\n\nPeople on TikTok are coating their testicles in soy sauce in bizarre viral trend\n\nMOST READ IN TECH APPLE CRUMBLE Which iPhones are 'obsolete' and 'dangerous' in 2020?
