However, the central government moved the top court through its Additional Solicitor General KM Natraj seeking an urgent hearing on its appeal.\n\nThe Centre and the Delhi government had challenged the trial court\u2019s order on January 31 that stayed the execution of the convicts \u2013 Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31) \u2013 until further orders. S\n\nExpressing concern over the delay in execution, the victim\u2019s parents urged the court to expeditiously decide the Centre\u2019s plea and were assured by the judge that the order would be passed at the earliest.\n\nMeanwhile, Delhi High Court on Wednesday maintained that all the four convicts will be hanged together. The high court also gave the convicts a week\u2019s time to avail all legal remedies.\n\nOn January 7, warrants for the execution of all the four convicts in Tihar jail at 7 AM on January 22 were issued. However, the convicts could not be hanged because of pendency of mercy petition by one of them. Later, the trial court fixed February 1, 6 AM as the hanging date and time. That, too, got delayed in the wake of the legal remedies being exercised by the remaining Nirbhaya convicts.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["delhi high court", "Nirbhaya case", "Supreme Court"], "tags": ["delhi high court", "Nirbhaya case", "Supreme Court"], "authors": ["India.Com News Desk"], "publish_date": "Fri Feb  7 00:01:24 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A three-judge bench, comprising Justices R Bhanumathi, Ashok Bhushan and AS Bopanna, will hear the government's plea at 12:30 PM against the Delhi High Court's verdict.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/76x761.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": "111369852268642,202151043156155,866415226763838,775670142542664"}, "article": {"published": "2020-02-07T00:01:24+05:30", "modified": "2020-02-07T00:01:24+05:30", "published_time": "2020-02-07T00:01:24+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-02-07T00:01:24+05:30", "author": "https://www.india.com/author/newsdesk/"}, "description": "A three-judge bench, comprising Justices R Bhanumathi, Ashok Bhushan and AS Bopanna, will hear the government's plea at 12:30 PM against the Delhi High Court's verdict.", "keywords": "delhi high court,Nirbhaya case,Supreme Court", "news_keywords": "delhi high court,Nirbhaya case,Supreme Court", "robots": "index,follow", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Nirbhaya Case: Supreme Court to Hear Delhi Govt, Centre's Appeal Against HC Verdict Today", "description": "A three-judge bench, comprising Justices R Bhanumathi, Ashok Bhushan and AS Bopanna, will hear the government's plea at 12:30 PM against the Delhi High Court's verdict.", "url": "https://www.india.com/news/india/nirbhaya-case-supreme-court-to-hear-delhi-govt-centres-plea-against-high-court-verdict-staying-convicts-execution-3934448/", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Supreme-Court-IANS-1.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 700, "height": 415}, "site_name": "India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "India.com News Desk", "msvalidate.01": "FD7837E94C694BA88985E0E95C05B284"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.india.com/news/india/nirbhaya-case-supreme-court-to-hear-delhi-govt-centres-plea-against-high-court-verdict-staying-convicts-execution-3934448/"}
