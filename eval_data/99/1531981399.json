Treatment consists of replacing the missing clotting protein (factor VIII) and preventing the complications associated with the disorder. Replacement of this protein may be obtained through recombinant factor VIII, which is artificially created in a lab. Several recombinant forms of factor VII are also approved for the treatment of hemophilia A. In some cases, subjects with hemophilia A may develop inhibitors' against the replacement factor VIII. Inhibitors are antibodies, which are specialized proteins created by the body's immune system to combat foreign or invading substances such as toxins or bacteria. The immune system may recognize replacement factor VIII as foreign' and create these antibodies (inhibitors), which target and destroy the replacement factor. For inhibitors treatment is mainly dependent on bypassing agents and immne tolerance therapy (ITI).\n\n\n\nThe disease epidemiology covered in the report provides historical as well as forecasted epidemiology [segmented by Total Prevalence of Hemophilia A, Diagnosed and Treated Prevalent Population of Hemophilia A, Severity-Specific Prevalence of Hemophilia A, and Prevalence of Hemophilia A with Inhibitors and Without Inhibitors] scenario of Hemophilia A in the 7MM Countries covering United States, EU5 countries (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom), and Japan from 2017 to 2030.\n\n\n\nReport Scope\n\nThe report covers a detailed overview of Hemophilia A explaining its causes, symptoms, classification, and pathophysiology.\n\nThe report provides insight about the historical and forecasted patient pool for seven major markets covering the United States , EU5 ( Germany , France , Italy , Spain , and the UK), and Japan .\n\n, EU5 ( , , , , and the UK), and . The report helps to recognize the growth opportunities in the 7MM countries with respect to the patient population.\n\nThe report provides the segmentation of the disease epidemiology by Total Prevalence of Hemophilia A, Diagnosed and Treated Prevalent Population of Hemophilia A, Severity-Specific Prevalence of Hemophilia A, and Prevalence of Hemophilia A with Inhibitors and Without Inhibitors.\n\nKey Report Strengths\n\n11-Year Forecast\n\n7MM Coverage\n\nTotal Prevalence of Hemophilia A\n\nDiagnosed and Treated Prevalent Population of Hemophilia A\n\nSeverity-Specific Prevalence of Hemophilia A\n\nPrevalence of Hemophilia A with Inhibitors and without Inhibitors\n\nReport Assessment\n\nPatient segmentation\n\nDisease risk and burden\n\nRisk of disease by the segmentation\n\nFactors driving growth in a specific patient population\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.
