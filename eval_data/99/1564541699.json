It echoes a proposal made over the weekend by Guaid\u00f3 that shows how growing concerns about the coronavirus, which threatens to overwhelm the South American country\u2019s already collapsed health system and economy, are reviving U.S. attempts to pull the military apart from Maduro.\n\n\u201cThis framework can provide a path that ends the suffering and opens the path to a brighter future for Venezuela,\u201d said Pompeo in Washington.\n\nUnder the plan, both Maduro and Guaid\u00f3, who some 60 countries recognize as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader, would step aside and cede power to a five-member council of state to govern the country until presidential and parliamentary elections can be held within 6-12 months. The military high command \u2014 the traditional arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela and a key plank of support for Maduro \u2014 would remain in place for the duration of the transitional government.\n\nFour of the members would be appointed by the opposition-controlled National Assembly that Guaid\u00f3 heads. To draw buy-in from the ruling socialist party, a two-thirds majority would be required. The fifth member, who would serve as interim president until elections are held, would be named by the other council members. Neither Maduro nor Guaid\u00f3 would be on the council but Pompeo said Guaid\u00f3 would be free to run for president when elections are held.\n\n\u201cThe hope is that this setup promotes the selection of people who are very broadly respected and known as people who can work with the other side,\u201d U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams told the AP in a preview of the plan. \u201cEven people in the regime look at this and realize Maduro has to go, but the rest of us are being treated well and fairly.\u201d\n\nThe plan also outlines for the first time U.S. requirements for lifting sanctions against Maduro officials and the oil industry \u2014 the source of nearly all of Venezuela\u2019s foreign income.\n\nWhile those accused of grave human rights abuses and drug trafficking are not eligible for sanctions relief, individuals who are blacklisted because of the position they hold inside the Maduro government \u2014 such as members of the supreme court, electoral council and the rubber-stamp constitutional assembly \u2014 would benefit.\n\nBut for sanctions to vanish, Abrams said the council would need to be functioning and all foreign military forces \u2014 from Cuba or Russia \u2014 would need to leave the country.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping is that this really intensifies a discussion inside the army, Chavismo, the ruling socialist party and the regime on how to get out of the terrible crisis they\u2019re in,\u201d Abrams said.\n\nMaduro\u2019s Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza all but rejected the call for dialogue, saying Maduro \u201cnever will betray the vote of confidence that the people gave him.\u201d\n\nFor months, the U.S. has relied on economic and diplomatic pressure to try and break the military\u2019s support for Maduro and last week U.S. prosecutors indicted Maduro and key stakeholders \u2014 including his defense minister and head of the supreme court \u2014 on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.\n\nStill, any power-sharing arrangement is unlikely to win Maduro\u2019s support unless the thorny issue of his future is addressed and he\u2019s protected from the U.S. justice system, said David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little hard to see how this is going to be convincing to the major players in the government,\u201d said David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cThey seem to think the military is going to step in, but that seems extremely unlikely.\u201d\n\nIt also would require the support of Cuba, China or Russia, all of whom are key backers of Maduro.\n\nThe standoff between Maduro and Guaid\u00f3 has only grown more tense in recent days. Maduro\u2019s chief prosecutor on Tuesday summoned Guaid\u00f3 to testify after one of the individuals indicted on drug charges said he signed a contract with the opposition leader and his American \u201cadvisers\u201d to purchase U.S. assault rifles for a planned coup.\n\nGuaid\u00f3\u2019s team said he has never met the retired general, who subsequently surrendered to officials and was taken to the U.S. from his home in Colombia where he had lived since 2018 despite having been previously sanctioned by the U.S. for drug smuggling.\n\nA senior administration official said Monday that the U.S. is willing to negotiate with Maduro the terms of his exit even in the wake of the indictments.\n\nBut recalling the history of Gen. Manuel Noriega in Panama, who was removed in a U.S. invasion after being charged himself for drug trafficking, he cautioned that his options for a deal were running out.\n\n\u201cHistory shows that those who do not cooperate with U.S. law enforcement agencies do not fare well,\u201d the official said in a call with journalists on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. policy.\n\nGuaid\u00f3\u2019s called on Saturday for the creation of a \u201cnational emergency government\u201d was accompanied with the promise of $1.2 billion in loans from international financial institutions to fight the pandemic.\n\nThe spread of the coronavirus threatens to overwhelm Venezuela\u2019s already collapsed health system while depriving its crippled economy of oil revenue on which it almost exclusively depends for hard currency.\n\nLast September, Guaid\u00f3 proposed a similar transitional government in talks with Maduro officials sponsored by Norway, which never gained traction.\n\nBut with the already bankrupt country running out of gasoline and seeing bouts of looting amid the coronavirus pandemic, calls have been growing for both the opposition and Maduro to set aside their bitter differences to head off a nightmare scenario.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Deb Riechmann and Matt Lee in Washington, and Scott Smith in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 31 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "lytics": {"topics": "Business News, Health News, National News, World News"}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "US outlines plan for Venezuela transition, sanctions relief", "description": "MIAMI (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration is prepared to lift crippling sanctions on Venezuela in support of a new proposal to form a transitional government requiring both Nicolas Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 to step aside in favor of a five-person governing council, U.S. officials said.
