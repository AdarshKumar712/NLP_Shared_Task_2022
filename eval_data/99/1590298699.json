First-quarter net income slumped 97 per cent as revenue declined 19 per cent.\n\nKey insights\n\nThe only positives Adidas pointed to are China and South Korea, where stores have reopened, and online shopping.\n\nSales have gradually improved in greater China in the first three weeks of the quarter, and global online growth is accelerating from a 55 per cent increase in March. Still, e-commerce won\u2019t make up for the closures in Europe, North and South America, Russia and other parts of Asia, chief executive officer Kasper Rorsted said in a Bloomberg TV interview.\n\nHe assumes stores will gradually reopen and demand will rebound as people will want to exercise after being cooped up at home for weeks. Still, that\u2019s not soon enough to really help the second quarter.\n\nRorsted also said Adidas aims to pay back its state-backed loan as quickly as possible, though he wouldn\u2019t comment on whether it\u2019s in talks with banks.\n\nAdidas burned 1.4 billion euros in cash in the first quarter as it took back unsold products from stores in China and dealt with cancellations of purchase orders and an increase in bad debt allowances.\n\nMarket performance\n\nThe stock was little changed at 9:25 a.m. after previously dropping as much as four per cent. The shares have lost almost a third of their value this year.\n\nLoading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...
