preparedness\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfter the whole country\u2019s arduous efforts, a positive trend has emerged as the epidemic prevention and control situation has seen steady improvement and the

well as economic and social development.\n\nAccording to a statement released at the end of the meeting, the CPC leadership talked about \u201c\u2026unleashing consumption that had been suppressed by the outbreak and strengthening new and upgraded consumption to compensate the lost consumption on goods and services during the outbreak\u201d.\n\n\u201cMore attention is paid to epidemic prevention and control work in Beijing and other key regions,\u201d they said.\n\nMeanwhile, central China\u2019s Hubei province has classified its cities and counties based on the risks of the epidemic, according to local authorities.\n\nTwenty-two cities and counties had been classified as low-risk, while 17 classified as mid-risk and 37 as high-risk, by the end of Tuesday.\n\n\u201cCities, counties
