The move comes almost four months after President Mart\u00edn Vizcarra dissolved the legislature in a constitutional showdown with opposition lawmakers, and less than two weeks after the country\u2019s Constitutional Court ratified that move. The lawmakers will serve just 18 months until the current legislative session ends in July 2021. While polls indicate that the longstanding fujimorista Fuerza Popular party will see its representation go down below 30 percent for the first time in almost 15 years, what the new legislature will look like\u2014much less be able to accomplish\u2014remains unclear, says constitutional law expert Alonso Gurmendi of the Universidad del Pac\u00edfico in Lima.\n\nA lot of the uncertainty at the moment can be tied to voter apathy with close to a third of voters saying they plan to cast blank ballots. Even before September\u2019s constitutional crisis, Congress had an approval rating of 15 percent, and it\u2019s been over three years since the public had a more favorable-than-not view of the legislative branch. In fact, the main figure they approve of\u2014Vizcarra, whose approval rating is running at close to 60 percent\u2014isn\u2019t even on the ballot, since Peruvians will vote for the first time for just the legislature and not for the presidency simultaneously.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/core/misc/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.as-coa.org/articles/latam-focus-have-little-faith-peru-and-its-constitution"}
