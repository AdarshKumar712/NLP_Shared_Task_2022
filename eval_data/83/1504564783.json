His far-right coalition won the most seats in the last election in September, but it was not enough to form a government with a majority.\n\nIt is possible that the Blue and White party could win the next election \u2013 they actually came one seat ahead of Netanyahu\u2019s party, Likud, in the last election.\n\nREAD: US opposes Israel annexation of West Bank before peace plan revealed\n\nBut even if they did, so what? For the Palestinians, all Zionist parties in Israel mean the same thing: continuation of the daily, grinding, violent reality of Israeli racism and occupation.\n\nThe West Bank is under the boot of Israel\u2019s military dictatorship. Palestinians who dare challenge it are indiscriminately beaten, tortured, abused, have their homes demolished or are even murdered by the Israeli military and settlers.\n\nThe Gaza Strip is under constant siege, and the brave unarmed Palestinian demonstrators trying to break out of it since 2018 have been shot down dead by brutal Israeli snipers.\n\nThe Palestinians inside \u2018Israel\u2019 \u2013 the Palestinian territories occupied by Zionist forces, starting in 1947 \u2013 are not full citizens of the state. By law and by practice, they have far fewer rights than Jewish citizens of Israel. Israeli courts have consistently ruled for decades that there is no such nationality as \u2018Israeli\u2019 and that the state belongs to Jews alone.\n\nFinally, the Palestinian refugees outside Palestine still languish for long decades inside their camps \u2013 being denied their most fundamental right to return to the homes they were expelled from.\n\nREAD: Netanyahu vows to annex all settlements \u2018without exception\u2019\n\nBut this totally unjust situation is not enough for Israel \u2013 both the state and society wants more.\n\nAs I wrote at the time, in the last election, at least 89 per cent of Israelis voted for parties whose policy it was to continue the occupation of the West Bank \u2013 military dictatorship with no rights, remember \u2013 indefinitely.\n\nAnd now, with the third election looming, Israel\u2019s two leading parties, Likud and Blue and White, are both ramping up their threats to formally annex large parts of the West Bank.\n\nThe West Bank and the Gaza Strip together consist of only 22 per cent of historic Palestine, as it was at the time that the British occupation ended in 1948.\n\nSo, 78 per cent is not enough for Israel still. They want it all.\n\nWhile it seems unlikely for the time being, that they could get away with a mass expulsion, ethnic cleansing-type-event as they did in 1948, victory for Zionism looks like this: maximum land, minimum Arabs.\n\nSo, in working towards this end, Israel has been slowly, in the decades since it occupied the remaining 22 per cent, absorbing the entire West Bank through the creation of \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d.\n\n#IsraElex19: Israeli Elections 2019 Everything you need to know >>\n\nThese \u201cfacts\u201d are a slow-motion ethnic cleansing. Palestinian homes are declared to have been built \u201cwithout permits\u201d (impossible in many areas, since Israel almost always denies such permits to Palestinians \u2013 even while granting them to Jews) and are thus destroyed. Industrial-scale colonies for Jews are then built on the ruins.\n\nAnnexation will be the formal, post-facto legitimisation of such blatant criminality in Israeli law \u2013 and it looks set to be supported by the US.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has already done this in the case of the Golan Heights. This is a Syrian territory, illegally and violently invaded and occupied by Israel in 1967. Yet Trump (urged on by his number one campaign funder, Sheldon Adelson, a casino billionaire and important US Israel lobbyist), decided to formally recognise the \u201clegality\u201d of this outright criminality \u2013 just as he did in moving the US embassy to Jerusalem.\n\nSo there really was no doubt that the most pro-Israel US president would ever give the green light to any annexation move in the West Bank, even before the latest second-hand reports from anonymous Israeli sources emerged about the latest version of Trump\u2019s \u2018deal of the century\u2019.\n\nIn the forthcoming election, both main Israeli parties are attempting to outdo one another on how much Palestinian land they can steal, clear out of its Palestinians, and then annex for the purposes of building Israeli colonies.\n\nLast election, Netanyahu promised to annex the Jordan Valley, and Blue and White\u2019s Benny Gantz (a former general), indicated he\u2019d agree to the same.\n\nNow this election, Netanyahu is talking about annexing as much as 40 per cent of the West Bank, while Gantz is now promising to steal the entire Jordan Valley (the part of the West Bank that borders Jordan).\n\nAnnexation, then, is coming. Will this finally spell the long-forecast collapse of Israel\u2019s collaborationist entity, the Palestinian Authority? Time will tell.\n\nOne thing is for sure: this situation will not hold indefinitely. Five million Palestinians are being denied even their most basic human rights \u2013 systematically, by design of Israel\u2019s racist laws. This cannot be indefinitely sustained.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Jan 25 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i2.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cropped-favicon-large.png?fit=32%2C32&quality=85&strip=all&ssl=1", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"title": "The annexation of the West Bank is coming", "description": "We are about to witness the third Israeli election in the space of one year.
