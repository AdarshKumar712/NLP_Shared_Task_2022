Shoshana Bernstein, a spokeswoman for the Orthodox Jewish community in Monsey, said the statement is accurate.\n\n\u201cDoctors are not optimistic about his chances to regain consciousness, and if our father does miraculously recover partially, doctors expect that he will have permanent damage to the brain; leaving him partially paralyzed and speech-impaired for the rest of his life,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe family described Neumann\u2019s condition as dire and said a weapon \u201cpenetrated his skull directly into the brain.\u201d His right arm was shattered.\n\n\u201cOur father has seven children, many grandchildren, a great grandchild, and brothers and sisters,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cWe shall not let this terrible hate-driven attack be forgotten, and let us all work to eradicate all sorts of hate.\u201d\n\nYisroel Kraus, who was a guest at the home of the rabbi where a man wounded the victims with a machete, described Neumann as a mentor and an \u201cincredibly kind human being.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the most selfless people I know,\u201d Kraus told CNN. \u201cSince I knew him he was a very poor man. He never had a dime to his name and always goes around collecting money for other poor families. It was never about himself.\u201d\n\nAnother survivor was hit in the side of the head by the suspect\u2019s machete and doctors had to use three staples to close his wounds, Rabbi Shmuel Gancz told CNN Tuesday.\n\nShloime Rottenberg, the son of Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg, had just finished the ceremony of lighting the menorah at his father\u2019s home when the attack started, Gancz said.\n\n\u201cThey are grateful for what they deem a minor injury considering where else the machete could have hit him, such as his eyes,\u201d Gancz said of Rottenberg and his family.\n\nAuthorities identified the suspect as Grafton Thomas, 37. He pleaded not guilty to five counts of attempted murder Sunday. A day later, he was charged by federal agents with obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs involving an attempt to kill \u2014 a federal hate crime. A judge ordered him to be detained.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Thomas entered the rabbi\u2019s home in Monsey, north of Manhattan, on Saturday night and told the dozens of people there \u201cno one is leaving.\u201d He attacked them with an 18-inch machete, with at least five victims suffering injuries ranging from slash wounds to a severed finger and a skull fracture, federal prosecutors said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/krdo.com/2019/11/cropped-krdo-logo-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "One of the NY Hanukkah stabbing victims may not regain consciousness, his family says - KRDO", "description": "Doctors are not optimistic one of the men stabbed at a New York Hanukkah celebration will regain consciousness, according to the victim\u2019s family.
