And as much as they tried to focus on Sanders, they couldn\u2019t resist getting distracted by squabbling among themselves.\n\nAP Photo/Patrick Semansky Candidates participate in the Democratic presidential primary debate at the Gaillard Center on Feb. 25, 2020, in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), for example, decided to run over former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg one more time, calling him out for supporting Republicans for Senate, including in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and her own state of Massachusetts. And she again excoriated the billionaire self-funder over his alleged treatment of his former female employees.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, went after billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, who is threatening Biden\u2019s support from Black voters in South Carolina. Biden whacked Steyer over his hedge fund\u2019s millions of dollars of investments in the nation\u2019s leading private prison corporation.\n\nBut it was Sanders who drew most of the attacks on Tuesday, as he noted onstage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight. I wonder why,\u201d the senator quipped at one point.\n\nIn a shift, Warren launched her most direct attacks on Sanders yet. The two progressive champions have largely avoided going after each other in the 2020 race, but her path forward after South Carolina\u2019s primary on Saturday is far less secure than that of Sanders.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator called out Sanders early on in the debate, saying she would \u201cmake a better president than Bernie\u201d because of how she handled questions about \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and its implementation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take someone to dig into the details to make it happen,\u201d Warren said of her \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 plan, voicing frustration at the reaction from Sanders\u2019 campaign. \u201cI dug in, did the work, and Bernie\u2019s team trashed me for it.\u201d\n\nBloomberg whacked Sanders over reports that Russia is trying to help his campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s why Russia is helping you get elected, so you\u2019ll lose to [Donald Trump],\u201d he said. But the senator gave as good as he got, criticizing Bloomberg over his past praise of China\u2019s President Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a good friend of President Xi of China,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI think President Xi is an authoritarian leader, and let me tell Mr. Putin, who tried to interfere in the 2016 election and tried to pit Americans against each other: Hey, Mr. Putin, if I\u2019m president, trust me, you won\u2019t interfere with any more elections.\u201d\n\nBiden slammed Sanders for past votes against gun control measures in the 1990s, including the Brady Act, which mandated federal background checks and a waiting period for some handgun purchases. Though Sanders now supports gun control measures, Biden said the 2015 church massacre in Charleston, which took place mere feet away from the debate stage, may have not have happened if stricter gun control measures were in place.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s responsible for the nine deaths,\u201d Biden said of Sanders, \u201cbut that man would not be able to get that weapon without a waiting period,\u201d he added, referring to the shooter.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the other moderates in the race, hit Sanders over the cost of his health care and economic proposals.\n\n\u201cThe math does not add up,\u201d Klobuchar said of Sanders\u2019 plans.\n\nButtigieg, meanwhile, argued that nominating a self-described Democratic socialist would hurt Democrats\u2019 chances at flipping the Senate and defending their House majority in November.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s do some math ... It adds up to four more years of Donald Trump,\u201d Buttigieg warned about a potential Sanders nomination.\n\nHe also pressed Sanders on the filibuster and his opposition to rewriting the Senate\u2019s longstanding supermajority rule on legislation. \u201cHow are we going to deliver a revolution if you won\u2019t even support a rule change?\u201d Buttigieg asked.\n\nWarren piled on, saying that \u201cpeople like Bernie\u201d have \u201cgiven a veto\u201d to the pharmaceutical and insurance industries by refusing to call for an end to the filibuster.\n\nSanders didn\u2019t give an inch, staying on-message as he has in past debates. He said he would pay for his proposals through a tax on the wealthiest Americans, as well as some tax increases on the middle class he said would be offset by lower health care costs. The biggest misconception about his campaign, he added, is that \u201cthe ideas I\u2019m talking about are radical. They\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nThe senator also defended his recent comments in which he praised aspects of Fidel Castro\u2019s government in Cuba. \u201cI have opposed authoritarian governments all over the world,\u201d Sanders said Tuesday, arguing that they deserved praise when they do something right.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if Tuesday\u2019s unorganized assault on Sanders will be enough to deny his path to the Democratic nomination, however. With the moderate lane in the race split between several candidates, Sanders is currently projected to take a huge lead in the delegate-rich Super Tuesday states \u2015 a lead that may be irreversible after next week.\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign summed up the decidedly chaotic debate with an email subject line that will only help his cause with his most ardent supporters: \u201cUS against everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s us against the entire damn political establishment,\u201d the campaign wrote in the fundraising plea. \u201cTonight it was the candidates taking aim at Bernie on the debate stage. Tomorrow it will be their super PACs and their personal billions taking aim at us in television ads.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Politics", "Bernie Sanders", "2020 election", "Democratic Primary", "Presidential Debates", "South Carolina"], "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Democrats", "What's Working: D & I In Action", "Politics", "Bernie Sanders", "In This Together", "Presidential Debates", "Podcasts", "Pride 2020", "Latinx Heritage Month", "HuffPost Press Room", "Extremism", "Work In Progress", "Social Justice", "Congress", "Democratic Primary", "Living Well, Delivered", "2020 Election", "Finds", "Impact: This New World", "SHOPPING"], "authors": ["Politics Reporter"], "publish_date": "Tue Feb 25 22:08:32 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Vermont senator drew most of the attacks onstage in Charleston.
