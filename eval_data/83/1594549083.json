We should not go back to our old ways. The sense of urgency that is coming from the crisis must translate into accelerated action on things that will make our continent less dependent on others in times like this. We should aim not only to build back the economy, but to build back better,\" the speakers recommended.\n\nThe delegates called on African leaders to use the urgency created by the pandemic to accelerate investments in implementing the African Development Bank Group's Hi 5s, accelerate regional integration and deepen local financial markets to withstand future shocks as envisaged under the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement.\n\nCOVID-19 is spreading quickly in Africa and is already straining the continent's fragile health systems, economies, trade, cultures, societies and livelihoods. Africa's public and private sectors, individuals and communities are struggling to respond to the pandemic amid commercial lockdowns and disruption of income sources.\n\nIt is estimated that Africa will require stimulus worth $110-$150 billion to provide social and economic relief to its economies in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nThe webinar, titled Enhancing Resilience in African Economies: Macro-Economic Policy Responses to COVID-19 Pandemic in Africa, sought to address the implications for African economies as many nations scrambled together fiscal stimulus packages to avoid total economic collapse.\n\nThe panellists, comprising global leaders, researchers, academics, former finance ministers and central bank governors, explored potential fiscal, monetary and governance reforms that would bolster resilience of African economies.\n\nKey recommendations that emerged include the need for innovative fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies that focus on saving the livelihoods of citizens, rescuing thriving private investments, including small businesses, to protect jobs, and strengthening regional and national institutions to make them more independent, resilient and effective.\n\nAnother key recommendation is the need to strengthen health infrastructure across African countries, invest in STEM to equip countries for the digital economy and to build capacity of member countries to implement existing policies and continental declarations already acceded to by them.\n\nThe seminar highlighted the fact that Africa's youthful population is a big plus for Africa's ability to withstand the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus is known to have more effects on the aged (over 60 years) and people with underlying health conditions. The delegates called on leaders to consider lock-down policies based on science and evidence relevant to the realities of each country. There is no magic bullet that fits every country's conditions.\n\nNoting that COVID-19 is a pandemic within many other endemic diseases and external shocks such as malaria, tuberculosis and climate change, the experts recommended the creation of an Africa Group of 30, comprised of finance ministers and Central Bank governors to champion best-case macro-economic policy responses to these persistent problems.\n\nGovernment and business leaders must improve transparency and accountability to attract more investment inflows and donor assistance for inclusive development, the panelists agreed.\n\nMore than 350 participants tuned into the seminar, the first in a series held by the ADI as part of its Global Community of Practice (G-CoP) to facilitate knowledge and policy dialogue to help African countries respond better to the pandemic.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Coronavirus Africa Liberia By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

Its goal is to lead efforts at building sustainable capacity for development effectiveness in the Bank's regional member countries.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Africa", "news", "politics", "economy", "trade", "business", "sports", "current events", "travel", "Coronavirus", "West Africa", "Health and Medicine", "Africa", "Liberia"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri May  1 09:27:33 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Press Release - - Panelists, ADI webinar", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn03.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "Press Release - - Panelists, ADI webinar", "google-site-verification": "bGxG4qeN9up-gMXKjsgylykqjVrzxLjg1rQrP3K-rJk", "keywords": "Africa, news, politics, economy, trade, business, sports, current events, travel, Coronavirus, West Africa, Health and Medicine, Africa, Liberia", "msvalidate.01": "72401C28AAAC95E8D3FF1881A90F2C4D", "robots": "noarchive", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Press Release - - Panelists, ADI webinar", "image": "https://cdn07.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-128x128.png", "site": "@allafrica", "title": "Africa: COVID-19 to Accelerate African Regional Integration"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "article": {"modified_time": "2020-05-01T09:27:33+0000", "published_time": "2020-05-01T09:27:33+0000", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/allAfricacom/98946450029", "section": "News", "tag": "Liberia"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100369188719, "pages": 98946450029}, "og": {"description": "Press Release - - Panelists, ADI webinar", "image": "https://cdn07.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-128x128.png", "site_name": "allAfrica.com", "title": "Africa: COVID-19 to Accelerate African Regional Integration", "type": "article", "url": "https://allafrica.com/stories/202005010254.html"}}, "canonical_link": "https://allafrica.com/stories/202005010254.html"}
