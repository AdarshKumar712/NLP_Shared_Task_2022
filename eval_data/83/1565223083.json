We will then share this with individuals who need information about the support on offer.\n\nDo you want to help?\n\nThis is a light touch \"matching\" service linking people who need help with local people and groups.\n\nPlease contact us using the forms, or phone number below, if you are:\n\nAn individual, community group or network who would like to offer activities or support\n\nA community group supporting people in relation to Coronavirus and would like information, advice, resources or funding\n\nA community organisation offering staffing or other resources\n\nAn individual, family, organisation or company offering help and resources\n\nA resident who would like practical support because you are self-isolating because of Coronavirus\n\nCaring for, or are aware of someone, who would benefit from practical support because of Coronavirus\n\nPlease see our Volunteering top tips page for advice on your own wellbeing as a volunteer.\n\nHow to use this service?", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Exeter City Council"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A new service linking people who need help with local people and groups", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.exeter.gov.uk/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"description": "A new service linking people who need help with local people and groups", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "index, follow", "dcterms.identifier": 9665, "twitter": {"title": "Exeter Community Wellbeing - Exeter City Council", "site": "@exetercitycouncil", "description": "A new service linking people who need help with local people and groups", "card": "summary", "image": "http://exeter.gov.uk/img/logos/ecc_brand_200x71-original.png"}, "og": {"image": "http://exeter.gov.uk/img/logos/ecc_brand_200x71-original.png", "description": "A new service linking people who need help with local people and groups", "site_name": "Exeter City Council website", "type": "website", "url": "/clean-safe-city/community-safety/coronavirus/exeter-community-wellbeing/", "locale": "en_GB", "title": "Exeter Community Wellbeing - Exeter City Council"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.exeter.gov.uk/mstile-144x144.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://exeter.gov.uk/clean-safe-city/community-safety/coronavirus/exeter-community-wellbeing/"}
