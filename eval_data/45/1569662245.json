Lynch, 35, also of Hector, was charged in District Court with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Lynch remains jailed in lieu of $200,000 bail ahead of her next court appearance on April 24.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint:\n\nLynch called 911 about 1 a.m. and said she shot her boyfriend. She told police that she aimed the handgun at Tebben, unsure whether it was loaded and it fired when she flinched.\n\nSeveral children were in the home upstairs at the time.\n\nElizabeth Lynch Credit: Renville County jail\n\nLynch later told police that she bought the gun a day earlier after getting mad that Tebben threw a plate and broke it.\n\nShe said she aimed the gun at Tebben when he came at her aggressively. She said there had been domestic abuse in their relationship.\n\nHe responded that she wouldn't shoot him, Lynch said. The gun discharged, Lynch explained, because she flinched and was unfamiliar with how to use the weapon.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Paul Walsh", "Pwalsh Startribune.Com"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The woman claims her boyfriend had taunted her that she wouldn't pull the trigger, according to the charges.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.startribune.com/img/touch-icon-iphone-retina.png?d=1586285876", "meta_data": {"app-env": "prod", "app-platform": "desktop", "app-revision": "V20200407", "bugsnag-api-key": "57098e87943fb0b8bcf51a8ffc9ca41a", "feature toggles": "[\"Comments\",\"Ads\",\"WelcomeScreen\",\"Meter\",\"lazy load\",\"Array Cache\",\"Show Minified Assets\",\"Zone 3\",\"Imgix\",\"User Platform Digital Access\",\"user-platform-account-registration\",\"Homepage The Stream\",\"Snowplow\",\"Recommendations\",\"User State Speed Increase\",\"Nativo\",\"Elections Article Banner\",\"Elections Results Dashboard\",\"Elections Results Dashboard - All Templates\",\"Optimizely\",\"Resonate\",\"Keywee\",\"Grazers\",\"Auto-Advance\",\"Index\",\"Amazon\",\"Use Personalization API\",\"emma lightbox\",\"Gtm\",\"grazers-zedo-video\",\"Bounce-X\",\"Obituaries Always Remembering Pages\",\"Obituaries Always Remembering Draft Preview\",\"Enhanced Obituaries\",\"Rubicon\",\"Header Bidding\",\"Prebid\",\"Obituaries Viafoura JS V2 Upgrade\",\"Ads Toggle\",\"Obituaries Always Remembering Links\",\"Zedo Ads\",\"Product Refresh Cookie\",\"CommentCount\",\"Obituary Guestbook\",\"BulkRedirect\",\"Eedition Credentials Check\",\"Facebook Authentication\",\"Day Pass\",\"Day Pass Facebook Login\",\"Bidphysics\",\"Outbrain\",\"Example Active\",\"Analytics\",\"Confiant\",\"Cron Status Pages\",\"Data Layer\",\"CmsApiCache\",\"Delay Asset Modified Cache Keys\",\"Product Refresh Cookie Javascript\",\"Set Session Cookie\",\"TSN Sports\",\"Mobile Overlay\",\"Prediction.IO\"]", "route-name": "content", "section-path": "/local/", "content-id": 569389972, "content-type": "story", "is-most-read": "false", "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "description": "The woman claims her boyfriend had taunted her that she wouldn't pull the trigger, according to the charges.", "news_keywords": "Domestic violence,western minnesota,central minnesota", "article": {"tag": "central minnesota"}, "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "type": "article", "title": "Did he taunt his killer?
