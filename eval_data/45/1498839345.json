The theft was reported to police on Jan. 16.\n\nThe University first reported to the police on Jan. 13 that less than 100 student accounts were compromised. School officials got in touch with the students to change their passwords.\n\n\u201cBYU-Idaho understands the importance of its data security and protecting the information we maintain for our students,\u201d BYU-I said in a statement. \u201cWe recently became aware of a security incident involving a small number of student financial accounts. The university immediately notified those students impacted directly and has been working with them on a case-by-case basis. With the assistance of a leading forensic firm, BYU-Idaho has launched an investigation; law enforcement personnel have been notified. If any additional accounts are identified, we will immediately notify the students and work with them to respond as necessary. As the university works to complete the investigation, we will look for opportunities to further enhance our existing security measures.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["BYU-I", "Theft", "hackers", "accounts"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Jan 18 20:21:03 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "BYU-Idaho - Student Media", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://byuicomm.org/byuiscroll/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/06/cropped-Untitled-1-32x32.gif", "meta_data": {"description": "BYU-Idaho - Student Media", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "$900.16 stolen from student account - BYU-I Scroll", "description": "Theft related to previous report of compromised school accounts.", "url": "https://byuiscroll.org/900-16-stolen-from-student-account/", "site_name": "BYU-I Scroll", "updated_time": "2020-01-18T20:47:25+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://byuicomm.org/byuiscroll/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2020/01/C3AA07A9-8880-423C-B57F-85F64C6DA9A3-1.jpeg", "secure_url": "https://byuicomm.org/byuiscroll/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2020/01/C3AA07A9-8880-423C-B57F-85F64C6DA9A3-1.jpeg", "width": 1020, "height": 686}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/byuiscroll/?hc_ref=ARTSyragAUBEehWuQMPLj7Bz0few-vQqqgl0e5PA-suWJpvlLa3i0DlFiDwnW2h68jk&fref=nf", "tag": "Theft", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-01-18T20:21:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-18T20:47:25+00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://byuicomm.org/byuiscroll/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/06/cropped-Untitled-1-270x270.gif"}, "canonical_link": "https://byuiscroll.org/900-16-stolen-from-student-account/"}
