I am testing using speedtest.net and using a wired connection.\n\nOver the past couple of weeks my broadband speed has dramatically dropped. I am now struggling to get to 100mbps download - typically about 85. While I am still getting about 35 upload.\n\nI have rebooted the router, reset the router and checked all the cables into the router. I have also done all of the network tests that virgin provides on its website.\n\nI have a Hub3. A couple of connection logs at the bottom of this message.\n\nI am unable to get through to anyone in VM due to the limitations on the call centres at the moment with CV19.\n\nThanks for your advice.
