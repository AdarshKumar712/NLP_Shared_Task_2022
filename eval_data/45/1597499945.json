Importing from Ecuador depends largely upon the destination country. The United States is the primary market for Ecuadorian exports as well as Ecuador's largest supplier of imports.\n\nEcuador\u2019s main export commodities are petroleum, bananas, cut flowers and shrimp. Its main export partners are the United States, Panama, Peru and Italy. Its main import commodities are vehicles, medicinal products, telecommunications equipment and electricity. The main import partners are the United States, Columbia, China, Venezuela, Brazil, Chile, Japan and Mexico.\n\nThere are approximately 150 free trade zones in the United States and four free trade zones in Ecuador. These are currently used for distribution, assembly, manufacturing and shipping of goods.\n\nEcuador, along with Peru, Colombia and Bolivia are the United States\u2019 favored trading partners. The United States, Ecuador and other trading nations, actually have more than one free trade zone. These free trade zones allow companies to ship goods into a country and then export them to the destination country without paying a duty. However a duty is always paid when goods reach their destination country.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["ecuador exports", "exports ecuador", "exports from ecuador", "ecuadorian exports"], "tags": ["partners", "petroleum", "imports", "Quito", "exports", "Galapagos", "market", "trade"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Ecuador's main export products include petroleum, cut flowers, bananas and shrimp, with its main export partners being Panama, Peru, United States and Italy.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.ecuador.com/wp-content/themes/geo-sites/assets//img/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Ecuador.com | Exports and Trade in Ecuador", "description": "Ecuador's main export products include petroleum, cut flowers, bananas and shrimp, with its main export partners being Panama, Peru, United States and Italy.", "keywords": "ecuador exports,exports ecuador,exports from ecuador,ecuadorian exports", "image": "http://www.ecuador.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/adriana.jpg", "url": "http://www.ecuador.com/business/exports/"}, "description": "Ecuador's main export products include petroleum, cut flowers, bananas and shrimp, with its main export partners being Panama, Peru, United States and Italy.", "keywords": "ecuador exports,exports ecuador,exports from ecuador,ecuadorian exports", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#123f6d", "google-site-verification": "8_yagrgBCx4GAq_yVEh0cGQ3zOf4qCeyuWc-0cj1Nis"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.ecuador.com/business/exports/"}
