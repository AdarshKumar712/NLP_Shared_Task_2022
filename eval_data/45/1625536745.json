Bumsted is heard on video explaining the press are considered \u201cessential workers\u201d and are allowed to be on the streets. An officer responds \u201cI don\u2019t give a s\u2014 -.\u201d Another tells Bumsted \u201cget the f\u2014 \u2014 out of here you piece of s\u2014 -.\u201d\n\nBumsted and Wong said officers shoved them, separating them from each other and pushing them toward Bumsted\u2019s car, which was parked nearby. At one point Bumsted said he was pinned against his car. He is heard on video telling the officer that Wong has his keys and he needs them to leave the area. Officers then allowed Wong to approach and the two got in the vehicle and left.\n\nOpinion This section contains relevant reference points, placed in (Opinion field)\n\nBoth journalists were wearing AP identification and identified themselves as media.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t care,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThey were just shoving me.\u201d\n\nNYPD officials said they would \u201creview this as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nJournalists have faced aggressive police and protesters during demonstrations across the US over the killing of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white officer pressed his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck.\n\nPolice in Louisville, Kentucky, apologized after an officer fired what appeared to be pepper bullets at a TV news crew, and a journalist in Minneapolis was shot by a rubber bullet.\n\nJournalists have faced other risks while covering the unrest, in addition to dealing with aggression from police. In South Carolina, a television news reporter was hit in the head by a thrown rock and outside the White House, a Fox News reporter was chased and pummeled by protesters. Someone grabbed the reporter\u2019s microphone and threw it at his back, and a Fox News photographer\u2019s camera was smashed.\n\nIn Atlanta, demonstrators who fought with police and set cars on fire also broke windows and scrawled obscene graffiti at CNN headquarters.\n\nAP spokeswoman Lauren Easton criticized the officers\u2019 actions Tuesday, which occurred as thousands of people in New York were defying a curfew put in place following several nights of violence and destruction. Journalists covering the story are exempt from the curfew.\n\n\u201cThe role of journalists is to report the news on behalf of the public,\u201d Easton said. \u201cIt is unacceptable and deeply troubling when journalists are harassed simply for doing their job.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Jubail", "Al-Ahsa", "Al-Kharj", "Taif", "Qatif", "oil", "Dammam", "Abha", "Asir", "Yanbu", "islam", "jobs", "sports", "Khalij times", "gulf news", "saudi gazette", "Riyadh", "Tabuk", "Mecca", "Medina", "AlMadinah", "Jeddah", "Makkah", "Hail", "Mecca", "Makkah", "Eastern", "King Abdullah", "jobs in Saudi", "work in saudi arabia", "umrah", "Hajj\u060c\u0639\u0631\u0628 \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0632"], "tags": ["Who's Who", "The Place"], "authors": ["Arab News"], "publish_date": "Wed Jun  3 13:49:26 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "NEW YORK: New York City police officers surrounded, shoved and yelled expletives at two Associated Press journalists covering protests Tuesday in the latest aggression against members of the media during a week of unrest around the country.
