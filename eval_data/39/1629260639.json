REUTERS/Henry Romero\n\nLosing the investment-grade rating that Latin America\u2019s second-largest economy has held for almost two decades would be a bitter blow for leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.\n\nHis fiscally conservative approach to finance and debt is guided by memories of Mexico\u2019s humiliating payments crises and bailouts in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\u201cLosing the investment grade rating is a real risk and now something investors increasingly think about,\u201d said Luis Gonzali, a portfolio manager at asset manager Franklin Templeton.\n\n\u201cIt could be the event that defines the presidency of Lopez Obrador and leads to investors fleeing Mexico fast, and at a large scale.\u201d\n\nAnalysts at JP Morgan said Mexico\u2019s big presence in major investment grade bond indices would exacerbate the scale of forced selling if it becomes a \u201cfallen angel,\u201d a company or country whose ratings have been cut to below investment-grade.\n\nAll three ratings agencies have already downgraded Mexico this year.\n\nFitch Ratings has its sovereign bonds at BBB-, with a stable outlook; Moody\u2019s Investors Services has them at Baa1 and S&P Global Ratings at BBB, both with negative outlooks, signaling further downgrades.\n\nTwo would have to rate Mexico speculative grade, or junk, for it to become official.\n\nJP Morgan analysts wrote in a research note that an estimated $44.3 billion of Mexican bonds are at risk of forced selling in the event of a cut to junk.\n\nAbout $4.5 billion of that total is corporate debt, they said, noting that a sovereign downgrade makes it harder for companies to hold an investment grade rating.\n\nGonzali estimated the junk label could initially push up borrowing costs for the Mexican government by as much as 300 basis points before settling at around 100 basis points higher than now.\n\nFRUGAL WAYS\n\nMexico was long a darling of investors as it reduced the role of the state and appointed U.S-trained technocrats attuned to Wall Street\u2019s preferences to reduce the state\u2019s role in the economy.\n\nBut its star was fading even before Lopez Obrador\u2019s 2018 election win.\n\nDespite his frugal ways since taking office, policy decisions including cancellations of billions of dollars of infrastructure projects and the renegotiation of energy contracts have further eroded trust.\n\nConcerns are also growing within the finance ministry, where one official said further downgrades were likely with a cut to junk possible as early as next year.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for Mexico\u2019s sovereign debt is very negative,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe problem is that there\u2019s now a confidence crisis in the politics of the government.\u201d\n\nJP Morgan\u2019s analysts agreed that a downgrade to speculative grade could happen late next year or in early 2022.\n\nThey cited low growth and the state\u2019s crowding out of investors in the energy sector among factors undermining Mexico\u2019s coveted investment grade. They also cited slow progress in diversifying the tax base, and a weak response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nInvestors already rate Mexican sovereign bonds similar to junk, with spreads to U.S. Treasuries climbing.\n\n(GRAPHIC: tmsnrt.rs/373EN08)\n\nThe spread has moved \u201cinto the pricing range of a security on the cusp of downgrade to high yield,\u201d said Andrew Stanners, an investment director at asset manager Aberdeen Standard.\n\nCarlos Serrano, an economist at BBVA, the country\u2019s largest bank, noted the market priced Mexico\u2019s last sovereign bond issue at a level similar to that of junk-rated Paraguay.\n\nMexico issued $2.5 billion in April at a yield to maturity of 5%, Serrano said, while Paraguay issued $2 billion the same month, and with a similar maturity, at a yield to maturity of 4.95%.\n\nNot all feel a downgrade to junk is inevitable, however.\n\n\u201cThe decision not to be fiscally expansive could pay off if we get a very quick recovery,\u201d said Stanners, referring to the lack of government spending to offset the pandemic\u2019s economic impact.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll mean that the fiscal position has not been eroded as harshly as other countries and could prevent rating downgrades to high yield.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["US", "MEXICO", "BONDS", "Credit / Debt Ratings", "Americas", "Credit Markets", "Corporate Debt / Corporate Debt Financing", "Debt / Fixed Income Markets", "Economic News (3rd Party)", "Emerging Market Countries", "Government Finances", "Investment Banking & Investment Services (TRBC level 3)", "Investment Management & Fund Operators (TRBC level 4)", "South America / Central America", "Graphics", "Mexico", "Major News", "Picture Available", "South America", "Reuters Top News"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Stefanie Eschenbacher"], "publish_date": "Mon Jun  8 11:11:37 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Mexico is facing its deepest recession in decades and prominent investors believe it could soon follow state oil company Pemex in seeing its credit rating relegated to \"junk\" territory as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/article/_next/static/images/favicon-9d0324f5d28e80e699a4e92617ab6f30.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow", "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Stumbling angel?
