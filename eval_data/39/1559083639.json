Omani police said no evidence of foul play had been found, although the cause of death has not been announced.\n\nBergling\u2019s family described the DJ and producer, who scored huge worldwide hits with Wake Me Up and Levels, as fragile and an \u201cover-achieving perfectionist\u201d in the second statement they have released this week.\n\n01:24 Swedish DJ Avicii dies at 28 \u2013 video obituary\n\n\u201cOur beloved Tim was a seeker, a fragile artistic soul searching for answers to existential questions. An over-achieving perfectionist who travelled and worked hard at a pace that led to extreme stress. When he stopped touring, he wanted to find a balance in life, to be happy and be able to do what he loved most: music.\n\n\n\n\u201cTim was not made for the business machine he found himself in; he was a sensitive guy who loved his fans but shunned the spotlight. Tim, you will forever be loved and sadly missed. The person you were and your music will keep your memory alive.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Bergling\u2019s family thanked his fans for their support in the days after his death when tributes poured in from them and the music industry.\n\nOn Saturday, thousands gathered in Stockholm to remember him. After a minute\u2019s silence, his most popular tracks were played and fans danced and sang.\n\nBergling retired from live performances in 2016, after years of intense touring that exacerbated his alcoholism, though he continued his studio work. He had suffered from acute pancreatitis, which was partially blamed on his drinking. After having his gallbladder and appendix removed in 2014, he cancelled a series of shows in an attempt to recover.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Nicola Slawson"], "publish_date": "Thu Apr 26 00:00:00 2018", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Swedish star remembered as \u2018sensitive guy\u2019 who was not made for the music business", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.guim.co.uk/images/favicon-32x32.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "Swedish star remembered as \u2018sensitive guy\u2019 who was not made for the music business", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/26/avicii-death-dj-could-not-go-on-any-longer-family-tim-bergling", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb45f6d7e44a7db3758a83ac383143d51c2e55d6/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=186fec3bb8f6bac57f0b6c39bb427a49", "description": "Swedish star remembered as \u2018sensitive guy\u2019 who was not made for the music business", "type": "article", "title": "Avicii's family say DJ 'could not go on any longer'", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicola-slawson", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Music", "published_time": "2018-04-27T06:07:22.000Z", "tag": "Avicii,Music industry,Oman,Sweden,Europe,Music,World news,Culture,Dance music", "modified_time": "2018-04-27T06:16:34.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://music/2018/apr/26/avicii-death-dj-could-not-go-on-any-longer-family-tim-bergling?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://music/2018/apr/26/avicii-death-dj-could-not-go-on-any-longer-family-tim-bergling?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/26/avicii-death-dj-could-not-go-on-any-longer-family-tim-bergling", "iphone": "gnmguardian://music/2018/apr/26/avicii-death-dj-could-not-go-on-any-longer-family-tim-bergling?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb45f6d7e44a7db3758a83ac383143d51c2e55d6/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=dc5975ec44a5bbee9e88dabed1aac1e0", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/26/avicii-death-dj-could-not-go-on-any-longer-family-tim-bergling"}
