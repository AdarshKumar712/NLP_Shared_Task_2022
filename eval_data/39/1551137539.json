If you stand too close to someone infected by COVID-19 and they sneeze or cough, you can breathe in the droplets and become ill.\n\nIt is believed COVID-19 is more contagious than the common cold and that it is possible that thousands, perhaps millions, will contract the virus in Mexico.\n\nIn recent days, countries such as Italy, Spain, and France have implemented quarantines, others are turning to \u201cself-quarantine\u201d and \u201cphysical distancing\u201d in order to avoid contracting the virus or spreading it to vulnerable sectors.\n\nVienen d\u00edas duros. Permanezcamos en casa, evitemos salidas no imprescindibles. Lav\u00e9monos las manos, mantengamos la distancia, tengamos paciencia.

These simple hygiene measures could help to prevent more COVID-19 cases.\n\nWhile at home, you can also disinfect and clean objects you constantly touch,\n\nRecommended: How to boost your immune system\n\ngm\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["EL UNIVERSAL in English", "Social Distancing", "Self-Quarantine", "Covid-19", "coronavirus", "Flatten the Curve"], "tags": ["coronavirus", "Covid-19", "Self-Quarantine", "Social Distancing", "Flatten the Curve", "EL UNIVERSAL in English"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 17 14:40:48 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "People are going into self-quarantine and physical distancing in a bid to slow down COVID-19", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/sites/all/themes/eluniversal/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 163316950407128}, "description": "People are going into self-quarantine and physical distancing in a bid to slow down COVID-19", "abstract": "El peri\u00f3dico de M\u00e9xico l\u00edder en noticias y clasificados", "keywords": "EL UNIVERSAL in English, Social Distancing, Self-Quarantine, Covid-19, coronavirus, Flatten the Curve", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "El Universal", "type": "article", "title": "COVID-19: Physical distancing could prevent a catastrophic scenario in Mexico", "url": "https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/english/covid-19-physical-distancing-could-prevent-catastrophic-scenario-mexico", "description": "People are going into self-quarantine and physical distancing in a bid to slow down COVID-19", "image": "https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/sites/default/files/2020/03/17/social_distancing.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@el_universal_mx", "creator": "@el_universal_mx", "url": "https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/english/covid-19-physical-distancing-could-prevent-catastrophic-scenario-mexico", "title": "COVID-19: Physical distancing could prevent a catastrophic scenario in Mexico", "description": "People are going into self-quarantine and physical distancing in a bid to slow down COVID-19", "image": {"src": "https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/sites/default/files/2020/03/17/social_distancing.jpg", "width": 1023, "height": 630}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-17T14:40:48-06:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-26T12:27:04-06:00"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/english/covid-19-physical-distancing-could-prevent-catastrophic-scenario-mexico"}
