The positive results that Vietnam has gained is just the first step and there remain a big risk of outbreak in the country.\n\nVietnam has quarantined 92 suspected infection cases. Nearly 16,200 people who had close contact with infected patients or entered Vietnam from epidemic-hit areas have been quarantined and monitored, of them 416 have been quarantined in hospitals.\n\nChairing a meeting of the cabinet's permanent members in Hanoi on March 5, the PM acknowledged the committee\u2019s achievements in the fight against COVID-19 with no new infection cases recorded over the past 23 days.\n\nGiven the complicated developments of the epidemic and the rapid spread of the novel virus in many countries in the world, the Government leader asked administrations at all levels, agencies and sectors to double efforts to combat COVID-19.\n\nHe ordered new countermeasures to promptly prevent the spread of the disease through land borders, aviation and the community.\n\nEmphasising the importance of concentrated quarantine solution, PM Phuc asked the Ministry of National Defence and localities to to continue to prepare locations in service of this work.\n\nHe also suggested measures to promote business and production and weather difficulties for sectors seriously affected by the epidemic.\n\nThe PM asked the health sector to build up plans to arrange human resources in different areas in case of the disease outbreak, while continuously conducting exercises for quick response. He also allowed the Ministry of Health to buy 20 million more face masks for reserve and protective wear to serve the fight against COVID-19./.\n\nCitizen protection in areas affected by the COVID-19 outbreak is one of the top priorities of the Vietnamese Government, the Foreign Ministry\u2019s spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told a regular press conference in Hanoi on March 5. Hang said the Foreign Ministry and Vietnamese representative agencies have actively and proactively launched measures to support and protect Vietnamese citizens living, studying, working and travelling abroad, especially in epidemic-hit areas. The Foreign Ministry actively updated information and warned Vietnamese citizens not to travel to affected areas. They also advised Vietnamese people living in the affected areas to follow guidelines and directions by the host authorities, and avoid taking unnecessary trips. In coordination with ministries, agencies and localities, the Foreign Ministry directed Vietnamese representative agencies abroad to work closely with the host authorities, asked Vietnamese embassies to regularly provide news about efforts on disease prevention and control, ensuring that medical care will be provided for infected persons and mitigating issues that negatively impact Vietnamese citizens. Vietnamese representative agencies abroad have launched hotlines round-the-clock, particularly in affected areas to offer instructions and stay ready to support citizens if necessary, she said. As for infected Vietnamese citizens abroad, Vietnamese representative agencies are required to regularly contact and ask the host authorities to offer treatment. At present, Vietnamese patients are in stable conditions.\n\nLatest News: Vietnamese Government responses to COVID-19 epidemic The following is quick summary of the measures taken by the Vietnamese Government in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, which is spreading fast across ...\n\nHong Kong confirms pet dog infected with COVID-19 The pet dog of a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong (China) was confirmed to be infected with the disease, in a likely case of human-to-animal ...", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["visa-free entry", "oversea Vietnamese", "COVID-19", "coronavirus", "SARS-CoV-2"], "tags": ["coronavirus", "Latest treatments, drugs, vaccine for Coronavirus (covid-19)", "Daily Horoscope: Astrology and zodiac forecast for every signs", "Best Vietnam travel tips and suggestions", "Foreigners in Vietnam today", "visa-free entry", "Vietnamese cuisines and dishes you must try", "overseas Vietnamese", "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19"], "authors": ["Vietnam Times"], "publish_date": "Thu Mar  5 23:21:47 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has agreed to suspend visa-free entry for overseas Vietnamese\u00a0(OVs) from countries whose citizens have visa-free entry unilaterally halted, firstly the Republic of Korea (RoK) and COVID-19-hit nations.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/modules/frontend/themes/vietnamtimes/images/ico/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has agreed to suspend visa-free entry for overseas Vietnamese\u00a0(OVs) from countries whose citizens have visa-free entry unilaterally halted, firstly the Republic of Korea (RoK) and COVID-19-hit nations.", "keywords": "visa-free entry,oversea Vietnamese,COVID-19,coronavirus,SARS-CoV-2", "news_keywords": "visa-free entry,oversea Vietnamese,COVID-19,coronavirus,SARS-CoV-2", "theme-color": "#ed1a23", "robots": "index,follow,noodp", "pagegen": "12-03-2021 11:41:13", "copyright": "Copyright (c) by https://vietnamtimes.org.vn/", "author": "Vietnam Times", "resource-type": "Document", "distribution": "Global", "revisit-after": "1 days", "GENERATOR": "https://vietnamtimes.org.vn/", "fb": {"admins": 100000170835517, "app_id": 277749645924281}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "url": "https://vietnamtimes.org.vn/pm-agrees-to-suspend-visa-free-entry-for-ovs-from-covid-19-affected-countries-18154.html", "site_name": "Vietnam Times", "title": "PM agrees to suspend visa-free entry for OVs from COVID-19 affected countries", "image": {"identifier": "https://vietnamtimes.org.vn/stores/news_dataimages/minhphuongvnt/032020/06/10/5325_2753_NQH05842.jpg?randTime=1615524073", "width": 900, "height": 420}, "description": "Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has agreed to suspend visa-free entry for overseas Vietnamese\u00a0(OVs) from countries whose citizens have visa-free entry unilaterally halted, firstly the Republic of Korea (RoK) and COVID-19-hit nations.", "updated_time": "2020-03-05T23:21:47+07:00"}, "article": {"section": "National", "tag": "visa-free entry,oversea Vietnamese,COVID-19,coronavirus,SARS-CoV-2", "published_time": "2020-03-05T23:21:47+07:00"}, "application-name": "Vietnam Times", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "google-site-verification": "L1vgAc8A5dk9Cu-h6EFoIxDh_PuPdEqNlgvxh9XCFMk", "viewport": "width=device-width", "msvalidate.01": "3D228D3A34695D3FF8CCAA5DD6AEAA6C", "yandex-verification": "cce31b1bf1afe81f"}, "canonical_link": "https://vietnamtimes.org.vn/pm-agrees-to-suspend-visa-free-entry-for-ovs-from-covid-19-affected-countries-18154.html"}
