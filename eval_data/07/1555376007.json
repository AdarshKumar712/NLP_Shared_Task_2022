For veteran hospitals to open their doors to the rest of the community, Cuomo needs to make a request to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cAs our civilian hospitals fill with patients, we must consider these facilities as options. Veteran Affairs was built to operate in these emergency conditions, and should be utilized,\u201d says Rose. \u201cAs a veteran myself, I never want to take away from the Veteran Affairs\u2019 ability to serve and treat our veterans. But if we do not act now that will happen and for a much longer time.\u201d\n\nCoronavirus infections in New York City are spreading rapidly, and local pols are urging Brooklyn residents to stay home to avoid exposure. On Monday, March 16th, Mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio signed an executive order limiting bars, cafes, and restaurants to food take-out and delivery, and closing catering halls, gyms, and movie theaters. Schools will shut their doors until Monday, April 20th, at the earliest. However, local hospitals are close to breaking point.\n\nGovernor Cuomo opened the first drive-through testing facility in New York City on Staten Island on Thursday, March 19th.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["southern Brooklyn", "coronavirus", "Max Rose"], "authors": ["Brooklyn Public Media"], "publish_date": "Sat Mar 21 22:04:22 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Congressman Max Rose has urged the federal government to open veteran hospitals to the general public for CoronaVirus Epidemic.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Congressman Max Rose has urged the federal government to open veteran hospitals to the general public for CoronaVirus Epidemic.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Open veteran hospitals to everyone urges local congressman", "description": "Congressman Max Rose has urged the federal government to open veteran hospitals to the general public for CoronaVirus Epidemic.", "url": "https://brooklynreporter.com/2020/03/open-veteran-hospitals/", "site_name": "The Brooklyn Home Reporter", "updated_time": "2020-03-21T22:10:06+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://brooklynreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MaxRose_6624d489cd01cdd15dbe04bb678f9b1f_800.jpg", "secure_url": "https://brooklynreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MaxRose_6624d489cd01cdd15dbe04bb678f9b1f_800.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 800}}, "article": {"tag": "southern Brooklyn", "section": "Community", "published_time": "2020-03-21T22:04:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-21T22:10:06+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Congressman Max Rose has urged the federal government to open veteran hospitals to the general public for CoronaVirus Epidemic.", "title": "Open veteran hospitals to everyone urges local congressman", "image": "https://brooklynreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MaxRose_6624d489cd01cdd15dbe04bb678f9b1f_800.jpg"}, "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.15.0", "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "https://brooklynreporter.com"}, "canonical_link": "https://brooklynreporter.com/2020/03/open-veteran-hospitals/"}
