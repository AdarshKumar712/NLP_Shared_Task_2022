It had been hard to imagine the rate dipping to 1 percent, but the president's call for extraordinary steps has expanded the possibility of a rate cut through an emergency monetary policy board meeting,\" said Kim Sung-hoon, an analyst at KB Securities.\n\n\n\n\"The Fed lowering its rate to nearly 0 percent may also boost market expectations for a 50 basis point cut by the BOK,\" Kim added.\n\n\n\nSouth Korea has reported more than 8,100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 75 deaths as of Sunday.
