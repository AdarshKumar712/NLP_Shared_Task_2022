They are easier to make and do not require the sophisticated technology needed to produce deepfake videos, which are fabricated to look realistic.\n\nIn the edited clip, which was less than 20 seconds long, Biden says, \u201cOur culture is not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation.\u201d Social media users paired the video with comments like \u201cIt's almost like Joe Biden is a Racist.\u201d Posts with the video surfaced across social media platforms on Wednesday.\n\nThe clip was taken from ABC News coverage of Biden speaking for more than an hour in Derry, New Hampshire, on Dec. 30, 2019. A review of the full video shows that Biden was commenting on changing the culture around violence against women. In discussing the difficulty victims face reporting sexual assault on college campuses, he said, \"Folks, this is about changing the culture, our culture, our culture, it\u2019s not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation. It is our English jurisprudential culture, our European culture that says it is all right.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the discussion, Biden, when asked about his work with women and sexual assault victims, talked about the need to change an entrenched \u201ccultural problem,\u201d that dates back centuries, noting that in the 1300s many wives were being beaten to death by their husbands without repercussions.\n\nBiden's campaign confirmed to The Associated Press that the presentation in the edited video was inaccurate.\n\nIt's not the first time Biden has spoken out about how violence against women dates back to English common law.\n\nOn March 26, 2019, Biden spoke at a New York event where he honored young people working to fight against sexual assault on college campuses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an English jurisprudential culture, a white man\u2019s culture,\" he said at the March event. \u201cIt\u2019s got to change.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Election 2020", "Biden", "Misinformation"], "tags": ["2020 Elections", "Coronavirus", "Coronavirus Special", "Trump Administration", "China", "Immigration"], "authors": ["Beatrice Dupuy"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan  2 16:28:19 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A video of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden that was selectively edited to falsely suggest he made racist remarks during a recent speech made the rounds Thursday on social media, raking in more than a million views on one tweet alone.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"epoch": 1577982499, "pubdate": "2020-01-02T16:28:19", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2020-01-02T16:28:19", "author": "BEATRICE DUPUY"}, "og": {"description": "A video of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden that was selectively edited to falsely suggest he made racist remarks during a recent speech made the rounds Thursday on social media, raking in more than a million views on one tweet alone.
