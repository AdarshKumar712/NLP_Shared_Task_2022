This is indeed an oasis in the barren desert,\u201d Kasilag said. \u201cThe teachers of our small and medium size member schools are crying for their survival right now.\u201d\n\nKasilag stressed that private schools are not business entities as they are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-stock, non-profit and they survive on tuition fees.\n\n\u201cWe have big collectibles that we missed to get because classes are stopped in March,\u201d Kasilag said. \u201cFAPSA schools did not hold final exams and we did not hold graduation exercises. These two major events in schools are the culmination of school year 2019-2020 but they did not take place and they are also incentives for the indebted parents to pay arrearages.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that from March to September are just seven long months when private school teachers will not receive anything.\n\n\u201cHow will they survive? These are professional teachers wallowing in poverty. Their counterparts in public schools have no problem. I understand, public school teachers enjoy lavish food on table as seen on Facebooks showing off at the envy of their starving friends from the private schools,\u201d said Kasilag.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["lockdown", "teachers", "Covid-19", "enhanced community quarantine", "private schools"], "authors": ["Neil Alcober"], "publish_date": "Fri Apr 24 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Federation of Associations of Private School Administrators expressed dismay on the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases that classes should resume in September.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://tribune.net.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cropped-LOGO-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://tribune.net.ph/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/School-students.jpg", "secure_url": "https://tribune.net.ph/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/School-students.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 800}, "url": "https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/04/24/private-school-group-dismayed-over-iatf-decision/", "title": "Private school group \u2018dismayed\u2019 over IATF decision | COVID-19 WATCH | Daily Tribune", "description": "The Federation of Associations of Private School Administrators expressed dismay on the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases that classes should resume in September.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Daily Tribune"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://tribune.net.ph/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/School-students.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/04/24/private-school-group-dismayed-over-iatf-decision/", "title": "Private school group \u2018dismayed\u2019 over IATF decision | COVID-19 WATCH | Daily Tribune", "description": "The Federation of Associations of Private School Administrators expressed dismay on the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases that classes should resume in September.", "site": "@tribunephl", "creator": "@tribunephl"}, "description": "The Federation of Associations of Private School Administrators expressed dismay on the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases that classes should resume in September.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tribunephl", "tag": "teachers", "section": "COVID-19 WATCH", "published_time": "2020-04-24T07:46:15+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 243577083080520, "pages": 2056657031212662}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.6", "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/04/24/private-school-group-dismayed-over-iatf-decision/?ia_markup=1"}, "google-site-verification": "vziAmCQoJSUIH98s8vZMphJfn_SRQXVfDxvc7wz-4KI", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://tribune.net.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cropped-LOGO-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/04/24/private-school-group-dismayed-over-iatf-decision/"}
