But with the new coronavirus popping up all over the country, a trip to your favorite tap room isn\u2019t in the offing. So breweries are stepping up, offering curbside growlers to stave off the grumbling.\n\nAmid the growing coronavirus pandemic, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper issued an executive order Tuesday closing all restaurants and bars, except for takeout. But instead of grumbling, Tar Heels are growling. A number of other states around the country have put similar measures in place. But where one door shuts, another door may open, and breweries are finding that\u2019s a car door.\n\nWhite Street Brewery in downtown Wake Forest is offering curbside service for people who bring in growler bottles to be filled with their signature tap beers. They also offer two-pint cans called \u201ccrowlers.\u201d\n\nTap room manager Rene Betancourt says the gesture is the brewery\u2019s way of showing appreciation for customers while helping to stem the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cBeer isn\u2019t a necessity,\u201d she says. \u201cBut \u2026 beer is a social thing. So, the fact that we\u2019re having to distance ourselves from each other, and those opportunities are being taken away, I think that is affecting a lot of people.\u201d\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, and the vast majority recover in several weeks. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause severe illness, including pneumonia.\n\nTo help customers make up for some of the fun they\u2019re missing from prohibited barroom gatherings \u2014 and to give a boost to flagging business \u2014 Austin Beerworks in Texas posted a photo of brightly colored cans and bottles stacked up at a new make-shift drive-thru.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with new rules, our taproom is now only able to offer Beer-To-Go,\u201d the brewery said in a tweet. \u201cWe set up a drive through tent and are working on preordering online.\u201d\n\nWolf Creek Brewery in Valencia, California, tweeted: \u201cThe brewery/tasting room may be closed for on premise fun; however, you can head on over to @wolfcreekscv for drive through 6-packs, merch, and some delicious food!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, beer drinkers in Alabama rejoiced when the state\u2019s ABC Commission on Tuesday issued an emergency rule allowing curbside sales of unopened alcohol at restaurants and bars. \u2063The move came as the state shut down 78 state-run liquor stores throughout Alabama. The Mississippi Department of Revenue said Tuesday that it would allow package stores to offer curbside pickup of liquor and wine until at least April 30.\n\nIn Wake Forest, podiatrist Jim Judge usually comes to White Street a couple of times a week. So, he popped in to pick up three crowlers to take home.\n\n\u201cBeer is up there with whiskey \u2014 which I can\u2019t get here,\u201d he said, when asked where the suds ranked on his list of necessities. \u201cAbsolutely above toilet paper right now. Without a doubt.\u201d\n\nFighting fear with beer.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Alabama", "COVID-19", "north carolina", "Texas", "valencia", "Wolf Creek Brewery"], "tags": ["Latest figures by county", "Dr. Jandial"], "authors": ["Associated Press", "Los Angeles Times", "Nouran Salahieh", "With Reporting Erika Martin"], "publish_date": "Thu Mar 19 15:56:48 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name.
