The Fed has bought nearly $1.3 trillion of Treasuries alone, and many billions of non-sovereign debt it would historically have never gone near.\"The question is, are markets underestimating this (virus) in terms of the long-term impact on the economy. There will be damage and there will be damage in terms of the consumer psyche,\" Rabobank's de Groot said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/Icons/PNG/favicon-76.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 159050394216641, "app_id": 313311835670174}, "og": {"site_name": "The Jerusalem Post | JPost.com", "title": "US crude gets crushed on markets as share trading turns cautious", "type": "Article", "image": "https://www.jpost.com//HttpHandlers/ShowImage.ashx?id=370634&w=822&h=537", "url": "https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/us-crude-gets-crushed-on-markets-as-share-trading-turns-cautious-625227"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.jpost.com//HttpHandlers/ShowImage.ashx?id=370634&w=822&h=537", "url": "https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/us-crude-gets-crushed-on-markets-as-share-trading-turns-cautious-625227", "site": "Jerusalem_Post", "title": "US crude gets crushed on markets as share trading turns cautious"}, "can-recommend": "false", "robots": "\u201dmax-snippet:160,"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/us-crude-gets-crushed-on-markets-as-share-trading-turns-cautious-625227"}
