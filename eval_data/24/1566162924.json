A high-level community leader in Laredo said the situation is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and \u201ccomplicated\u201d and is a combination of drug cartels fighting and protests by farmers and ranchers.\n\nThe private Facebook group Nuevo Laredo Alert Roja issued an urgent warning on Wednesday morning giving locations of several blockades, including one near a national highway and neighborhood subdivision in the northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas. The post states there were shootings and detonations of explosives and to use precaution in the area.\n\nThis is the second time in three months that this city in the northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas has come under rapid gunfire. On Jan. 2, the Webb County Sheriff\u2019s Department issued an urgent warning after overnight gunfire was so rampant that it could be heard clearly from the backyards of residents in the U.S. side, where many took cover in their basements.\n\nDuring a Wednesday morning public health emergency conference call \u2014 which is held daily with Laredo city officials to discuss the COVID-19 situation \u2014 the gunfire situation dominated the conversation, Border Report was told.\n\nVisit BorderReport.com for the latest exclusive stories and breaking news about issues along the United States-Mexico border.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Mederios Babb", "Jocelyn Moran", "Kaile Hunt"], "publish_date": "Wed Apr  1 17:56:38 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "McALLEN, Texas (Border Report) \u2014 Gunfire and blockades Wednesday again terrorized the northern Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo, but was not a threat to the border Texas city of Laredo, the city\u2019s fire chief told Border Report. \u201cI saw the situational report come in that there was some gunfire occurring in Nuevo Laredo and I [\u2026]", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/apple-touch-icon-ipad-retina.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "McALLEN, Texas (Border Report) \u2014 Gunfire and blockades Wednesday again terrorized the northern Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo, but was not a threat to the border Texas city of Laredo, the city\u2019s fire chief told Border Report. \u201cI saw the situational report come in that there was some gunfire occurring in Nuevo Laredo and I [\u2026]", "google-site-verification": "fjpvWalZZMmvYSWvHCz1_P-w3KSUxs_12FQHr0Kt03M", "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "fb": {"pages": 109229519926}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "BREAKING: Gunfire and blockades again break out on streets of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico", "url": "https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/top-stories/breaking-gunfire-and-blockades-again-break-out-on-streets-of-nuevo-laredo-mexico/", "description": "McALLEN, Texas (Border Report) \u2014 Gunfire and blockades Wednesday again terrorized the northern Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo, but was not a threat to the border Texas city of Laredo, the city&\u2026", "site_name": "YourCentralValley.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/mexico-violence.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "secure_url": "https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/mexico-violence.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-04-01T17:56:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-04-02T05:18:58+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "BREAKING: Gunfire and blockades again break out on streets of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico"}, "image": "https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/mexico-violence.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "BREAKING: Gunfire and blockades again break out on streets of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico", "description": "McALLEN, Texas (Border Report) \u2014 Gunfire and blockades Wednesday again terrorized the northern Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo, but was not a threat to the border Texas city of Laredo, the city&\u2026"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/apple-touch-icon-ipad-retina.png?w=152"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.borderreport.com/regions/mexico/breaking-gunfire-and-blockades-again-break-out-on-streets-of-nuevo-laredo-mexico/"}
