Joaquin Temes\n\nWith Latin America now the \u201cepicenter\u201d of the COVID-19 pandemic, Argentina is attracting global attention as its sovereign debt showdown with private creditors enters its most critical stage. The nation has defaulted for a ninth time after purposely missing debt servicing payments last week, but what appeared as a final deadline has once again given way to a mutually accepted extension. With talks underway, both sides have publicly accused each other of acting in bad faith, but have also recognized they prefer an agreement over a messy and acrimonious divorce. Argentina\u2019s debt restructuring negotiation has global implications in that it will serve as a sort of foreshadowing of what is to come given the immensity of the worldwide recession the coronavirus pandemic will leave behind. Whatever blueprint Argentina and its creditors leave for the rest of the world\u2019s increasingly troubled debtors, the nation will have to face \u201cthe day after\u201d sooner or later, where some 89 percent of the population has directly or indirectly received a public subsidy during this crisis, while the state is absolutely broke.\n\nPresident Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s bold bet on a young and inexperienced economy minister is close to revealing its worth. Mart\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n has led a meticulous and relatively civilized battle with Wall Street titans who have shown a predisposition to reaching a solution that works for everybody. Despite publicly shaming BlackRock BLK CEO Larry Fink, both as the Ministry leaked an initial offer of theirs that was \u201cnot even in our same planet\u201d and after Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s former Columbia University colleague Jeff Sachs signalled him out in a widely shared op-ed, it seems clear that the world\u2019s largest asset manager is ready to play ball. Leading the Ad Hoc Bondholders Group, which holds more than 25 percent of the post-2016 bonds and 15 percent of the 2010 \u201cExchange bonds,\u201d BlackRock has suggested to its fellow \u201cmasters of the universe\u201d that it is willing to negotiate lower returns in order to settle on a deal.\n\nIn a statement released last week, they noted, \u201cby providing the administration with an extended period of significant cash flow relief, the group seeks to provide a window for the steadfast implementation of policies which support economic growth, financial sector inclusion and overall sustainable development.\u201d Yet, and because this is a negotiation, they added: \u201cRegrettably, despite the efforts of the group and other stakeholders, the proposals contained in the recently published press release are not ones which the group can or will support.\u201d Reading between the lines it emerges that not only are these funds interested in reaching an agreement rather than litigating, but they are actively and constructively negotiating with Guzm\u00e1n and his team.\n\nThe same thing can be said of Guzm\u00e1n. While his countenance indicates introversion, dogmatism and resilience, he has walked hand-in-hand with the creditor group every step of the way, within the bounds of what he calls \u201cdebt sustainability.\u201d While he has publicly said that Argentina\u2019s offer is final and the risks of default aren\u2019t any worse than what the sovereign is currently experiencing, he has already pushed back the deadline for negotiations two times (this last one triggering an actual default) and acknowledged the very real possibility of improving the deal. Reports suggest a counter-offer by the Ministry is expected within days or weeks, meaning he is trying to close the deal before the new June 2 deadline. This doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t expect another extension, but that once again the self-imposed short deadlines are an indication of a certain haste to resolve the matter. It also doesn\u2019t guarantee that an agreement will be reached, but it tilts the scales that way. Failing to reach a deal would signal the failure of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s raison d'\u00eatre.\n\nWith Argentina formally in default, even if it is selective for the time being, the ticking clock has just been sped up with regards to the actual damage being caused by the situation. As both President Fern\u00e1ndez and Guzm\u00e1n have said, this situation \u2013 virtual default \u2013 was something they received from the previous administration and the work of former economy minister Hern\u00e1n Lacunza and his \u201cre-profiling\u201d of peso-denominated debt, as well as his predecessor Nicol\u00e1s Dujovne and ex central banker Luis \u201cToto\u201d Caputo. Every day that passes without a resolution is a day of increased uncertainty both in sovereign debt markets and in the private sector, which is suffering from the double whammy of Argentina\u2019s chronic economic decrepitude and the global crisis sparked by the coronavirus but also exacerbated by economic disruptions that preceded the pandemic.\n\nIt is also another day of emergency measures, and therefore financing, which at this point is essentially all money printing. It is not to say that once the veil of uncertainty regarding the debt situation is lifted Argentina will be able to access voluntary debt markets like some of its neighbors, as any deal reached with creditors would still be nothing more than ink on paper in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Yet, it would temporarily clear the risk of a hard default, and the subsequent shock to the market and popular confidence that would undoubtedly lead to increased animosity with sectors of the opposition. It is also time-consuming for the teams that should be planning Argentina\u2019s response to the economic catastrophe that is being left behind by a massive public health crisis, particularly as the country\u2019s major urban centers remain under lockdown.\n\nIt has become clich\u00e9 to say that every crisis is also an opportunity, but the \u201cstate of exception\u201d we are living through could give Guzm\u00e1n and Fern\u00e1ndez the support, and the space, to actually pursue structural reforms that would be impossible in other moments. Businessmen, union leaders, opposition politicians and the general population have been united by the common enemy that is the COVID-19 virus, and are now looking to the government for leadership and mission. Reforming the country could be one such objective. All of that is contingent on continued unity, which is something we should be very sceptical of, both because of those governing the country and those in the opposition. One step at a time.\n\nThis piece was originally published in the Buenos Aires Times, Argentina's only English-language newspaper.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Argentina", "BlackRock", "Larry Fink", "Alberto Fernandez", "Martin Guzman"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Agustino Fontevecchia"], "publish_date": "Wed May 27 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Argentina\u2019s debt restructuring negotiation has global implications in that it will serve as a sort of foreshadowing of what is to come given the immensity of the worldwide recession the coronavirus pandemic will leave behind.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i.forbesimg.com/48X48-F.png", "meta_data": {"referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=5,minimum-scale=1,user-scalable=yes", "description": "Argentina\u2019s debt restructuring negotiation has global implications in that it will serve as a sort of foreshadowing of what is to come given the immensity of the worldwide recession the coronavirus pandemic will leave behind.", "keywords": "Argentina,BlackRock,Larry Fink,Alberto Fernandez,Martin Guzman", "news_keywords": "Argentina,BlackRock,Larry Fink,Alberto Fernandez,Martin Guzman", "author": "Agustino Fontevecchia", "article": {"section": "Money", "section_url": "https://www.forbes.com/markets/", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/1167-5ecda039c80b230006135d7e", "published": "2020-05-27", "modified": "2020-05-26", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes", "author": "Agustino Fontevecchia"}, "og": {"title": "Everyone Wants A Happy Ending To Argentina\u2019s Debt Crisis, But Will They Make It On Time?", "site_name": "Forbes", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2020/05/27/everyone-wants-a-happy-ending-to-argentinas-debt-crisis-but-will-they-make-it-on-time/", "image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5ecda084abf9f200077362dd%2F0x0.jpg", "description": "Argentina\u2019s debt restructuring negotiation has global implications in that it will serve as a sort of foreshadowing of what is to come given the immensity of the worldwide recession the coronavirus pandemic will leave behind.", "updated_time": "2020-05-26T19:15:14.402-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@forbes", "creator": "@agufonte", "title": "Everyone Wants A Happy Ending To Argentina\u2019s Debt Crisis, But Will They Make It On Time?", "description": "Argentina\u2019s debt restructuring negotiation has global implications in that it will serve as a sort of foreshadowing of what is to come given the immensity of the worldwide recession the coronavirus pandemic will leave behind.", "image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5ecda084abf9f200077362dd%2F0x0.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2020/05/27/everyone-wants-a-happy-ending-to-argentinas-debt-crisis-but-will-they-make-it-on-time/"}
