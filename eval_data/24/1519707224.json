And you can\u2019t waste time mourning losses or celebrating wins \u2014 at least not until the game is over. Stamina, patience, precision of judgment \u2014 these are all the things I love about the job!\u201d\n\nWhen asked what advice she\u2019d give other women directors, she said, \u201cI would tell them to do things their own way and don\u2019t feel like you ever have to conform to the system, because the system was largely built by men. We need to take all the good lessons from the past and from those existing systems but also not be afraid to make our own rules,\u201d she emphasized.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Sarah Adina Smith", "Women Writers", "Amazon", "Women Directors", "Kristine Froseth", "Diana Silvers"], "authors": ["Laura Berger"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/themes/womenandhollywood-theme/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "generator": "WordPress 5.3", "og": {"url": "https://womenandhollywood.com/sarah-adina-smith-directing-ballet-drama-birds-of-paradise-kristine-froseth-diana-silvers-star/", "type": "website", "title": "Sarah Adina Smith Directing Ballet Drama \u201cBirds of Paradise,\u201d Kristine Froseth & Diana Silvers Star", "image": "https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kristine.jpg", "description": "Sarah Adina Smith\u2019s latest will be of special interest to fans of \u201cBlack Swan\u201d and \u201cBunheads\u201d: the writer-director of \u201cBuster\u2019s Mal Heart\u201d is working on a ballet drama.
