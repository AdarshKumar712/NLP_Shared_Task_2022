Some even turned to hoarding.\n\n\"That's because there is more 'virus' deception [not the actual virus],\" Wiendra Waworuntu, the ministry's director for the prevention and control of communicable diseases, said here on Tuesday, Antara reported.\n\nRead more: Still an Active TNI Officer, Dony Pedro, Leader of the King of the King, Underwent a Military Session\n\n\n\n\n\nWiendra said the new virus had not yet reached Indonesia. However, the ministry recommends those who cough badly to wear face masks, while those who are healthy should avoid being near sick people.\n\n\"There is a misconception [in public] that wearing a mask is a basic requirement. In fact, the basic need is to consume nutritious food in a balanced diet, get enough rest and, if you feel unwell, immediately consult a health facility, \"he added.\n\nAccording to Wiendra, it is important for Indonesia to become better at handling the spread of tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other deadly infectious diseases.\n\nIn addition, Wiendra said that the mask can be used by those who want to avoid polluted air. However, those who are healthy do not need surgical masks.\n\nSurgical mask sales have surged in Indonesia since the news about coronavirus, which was first discovered in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n\nRead more: Indonesia Refuses Request from the Government of Timor Leste to Quarantine Its Citizens Affected by Corona Virus in Bali\n\nAccording to sellers at the Pramuka Market in Jakarta, sales of protective masks have tripled. Meanwhile, KN95 respirator masks have become scarce on the market.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak in China has spread to 27 countries. The outbreak killed 427 people worldwide on Tuesday, Reuters reported.\n\nThe World Health Organization has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency and experts say much remains unknown about the pathogen, including mortality rates and transmission routes.\n\nNEWS24XX.COM/FIR", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["news", "news index", "national", "international", "automotive", "legal", "economic", "business", "technology", "sports", "video", "photos", "general NEWS24XX : Index of News"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "News24xx.com -\u00a0The Ministry of Health said the lack of facial masks in most cities in Indonesia was triggered by hoax news, not because of concer", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://news24xx.com/assets/image/logonews24.png", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"title": "Hoax News Triggers Mask Hoarding in Indonesia, said the Ministry of Health | NEWS24XX.COM", "description": "News24xx.com -\u00a0The Ministry of Health said the lack of facial masks in most cities in Indonesia was triggered by hoax news, not because of concer", "url": "/read/news/22380/Hoax-News-Triggers-Mask-Hoarding-in-Indonesia-said-the-Ministry-of-Health", "image": "/thumb/news/1580820050.jpg", "site": "@News24Xx", "creator": "@News24Xx", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "ID.NEWS24XX.COM"}, "og": {"title": "Hoax News Triggers Mask Hoarding in Indonesia, said the Ministry of Health | NEWS24XX.COM", "description": "News24xx.com -\u00a0The Ministry of Health said the lack of facial masks in most cities in Indonesia was triggered by hoax news, not because of concer", "url": "/read/news/22380/Hoax-News-Triggers-Mask-Hoarding-in-Indonesia-said-the-Ministry-of-Health", "image": "/thumb/news/1580820050.jpg", "site_name": "NEWS24XX.COM"}, "description": "News24xx.com -\u00a0The Ministry of Health said the lack of facial masks in most cities in Indonesia was triggered by hoax news, not because of concer", "keywords": "news, news index, national, international, automotive, legal, economic, business, technology, sports, video, photos, general NEWS24XX : Index of News", "site_name": "NEWS24XX.COM", "itemprop": "NEWS24XX.COM", "robots": "index,follow", "google-site-verification": "mTzwD9FbAd14x8jimvIfxfHftKIXeZ2Qk6_Dirf7d-U", "yandex-verification": "22f72c5377f4d994", "msvalidate.01": "24BCAA82C4D5ADAB08B8274E49F06E7F"}, "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/read/news/22380/Hoax-News-Triggers-Mask-Hoarding-in-Indonesia-said-the-Ministry-of-Health"}
