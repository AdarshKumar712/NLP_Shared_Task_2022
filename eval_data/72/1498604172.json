Ford together with 22 state law enforcement partners, reached an agreement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund, Inc. The agreement was created to ensure donors receive adequate information and disclosures when making charitable contributions through the company\u2019s online fundraising platform.\n\nPayPal Charitable Giving Fund, Inc. (PPGF) is the charitable arm of PayPal, Inc. PPGF is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation that allows donors to contribute funds electronically to PPGF and select a charity that will ultimately receive the benefit of their contribution. Donors\u2019 contributions are combined and distributed to the donors\u2019 chosen charities. PPGF does not collect fees from donors or charities for this service; however, a charity receives contributions more quickly if the charity maintains a PayPal account, a fact that had not been adequately disclosed to donors. In some instances, PPGF redirected donors\u2019 contributions from the charity selected by the donor to other organizations with similar purposes without informing donors.\n\n\u201cCharitable contributions are the financial backbone of many worthy causes,\u201d said AG Ford. \u201cConsumers should always have the information they need to make informed decisions about their donations. Today\u2019s settlement with PayPal\u2019s Charitable Giving Fund ensures every donor\u2019s wishes are honored.\u201d\n\nNationwide, charities regulators joined the effort to investigate PPGF\u2019s fundraising activities, including its disclosures, vetting practices and treatment of charitable contributions. To address the states\u2019 concerns, PPGF agreed to adopt reforms to its disclosures to ensure that donors know:\n\n\u2014That they are contributing to PPGF;\n\n\u2014The timeframe in which a selected charity may receive funds from PPGF; and\n\n\u2014The implication of being an enrolled versus an unenrolled charity on the PPGF platform.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlement, PPGF agreed to notify donors when it redirects a donor\u2019s charitable contribution to an organization other than the one selected by the donor. PPGF will also provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.\n\nPPGF also agreed to make a payment of $200,000 to the National Association of Attorneys General for deposit into the NAAG Charities Enforcement and Training Fund. This Fund has been established to defray costs associated with the investigation and litigation of cases brought by state charities regulators, and to provide training and education to those regulators.\n\nIn addition to Nevada, attorneys general from the following states and territory participated in this settlement: Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina Secretary of State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania Texas and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection represented Nevada in this matter.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["News"], "authors": ["The Ely Times"], "publish_date": "Sat Jan 18 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 5.7", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Attorney General Ford announces settlement with PayPal charitable giving fund", "url": "https://elynews.com/2020/01/18/attorney-general-ford-announces-settlement-with-paypal-charitable-giving-fund/", "description": "Carson City, NV \u2013 Today, Nevada Attorney General Aaron D.
