Those diagnosed with coronavirus outside the United States who have not undergone laboratory testing also are considered at high risk, as are those who have traveled from Hubei Province, China, where Wuhan is located.\n\nIf symptomatic, these people should be placed in immediate isolation, the CDC advised .\u201cIsolation for public health purposes may be voluntary or compelled by federal, state, or local public health order,\u201d according to the guidelines. \u201cLocal travel is only allowed by medical transport (e.g., ambulance) or private vehicle while symptomatic person is wearing a face mask,\u201d the CDC said.\n\nIf medical evaluation is needed, the hospital or other health-care facility where the testing will be done should be notified in advance.\n\nIf the person is not symptomatic, quarantine, either voluntary or by public health order, may be undertaken, with daily active monitoring and controlled travel.\n\nMedium risk\n\nThose considered at medium risk are people who have close contact with a person with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus who has symptoms, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing, and who do not meet the high-risk definition. Also, people living in the same home as a symptomatic patient but who consistently use precautions, such as isolating the patient in a separate room, wearing masks and gloves, providing food separately, would be considered at medium risk.\n\nA person on an airplane who is seated within 6 feet of a symptomatic passenger (approximately two seats in each direction) is also considered at medium risk, as is someone traveling from mainland China outside Hubei province who has not had high-risk exposure. Hong Kong and Macau are not considered part of mainland China.\n\nPhoto: U.S. CDC The CDC shared a sample seating chart for a 2019-nCoV aircraft...\n\nIf symptomatic, these people should follow essentially the same procedures as those at high risk, including immediate isolation, testing if warranted and advance notification to the health-care facility.\n\nIf the person has no symptoms, \u201cTo the extent possible, remain at home or in a comparable setting. Avoid congregate settings, limit public activities, and practice social distancing,\u201d the CDC said. Travelers from mainland China outside Hubei province with no known high-risk exposure should practice \u201cself-monitoring with public health supervision.\u201d Others should undergo active monitoring. Postponing travel is recommended. \u201cPeople who intend to travel should be advised that they might not be able to return if they become symptomatic during travel,\u201d the CDC said.\n\nLow risk\n\nThe CDC defines low risk as \u201cbeing in the same indoor environment (e.g., a classroom, a hospital waiting room)\u201d as a person with symptoms whose disease has been confirmed in a laboratory but not being in close contact. On an aircraft, a person is at low risk if seated within two rows of a symptomatic person but at least 6 feet away (such as across the aisle).\n\nIf symptomatic, the CDC\u2019s recommendation is to \u201cavoid contact with others and public activities while symptomatic,\u201d seek health advice about whether further testing is needed and to avoid public transportation while symptomatic.\n\nFor those with no symptoms, self-observation is all that is recommended.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration issued and order banning foreign nationals who have traveled to China in the previous 14 days from entering the United States, and quarantining U.S. citizens and family members who have been to Hubei province in the last 14 days.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Newsroom Staff"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "ispremium": 0, "dc.date": "2020-02-04T16:00:00Z", "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-04T16:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2020-02-04T23:00:34Z", "opinion": "false"}, "SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "news_keywords": "Av Harris, Trump, Hubei Province, Chinaa, CT, NewHaven, Wuhan, United States, Hong Kong, Macau, CDC, Department of Health, nCoV", "nlpOrganization": "CDC, Department of Health", "nlpPerson": "Av Harris, Trump", "nlpLocation": "Hubei Province, Chinaa, CT, NewHaven, Wuhan, United States, Hong Kong, Macau", "nlpOther": "nCoV", "nlpCategories": "%2FHealth%2FHealth+Conditions%2FInfectious+Diseases", "og": {"title": "CT to follow CDC guide on treating exposure to coronavirus", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to public health agencies on how to advise people at different levels of risk.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/CT-will-follow-CDC-guide-on-treating-anyone-15028979.php", "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/10/31/23/18978031/43/rawImage.jpg", "site_name": "NewsTimes"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NewsTimes"}, "fb": {"admins": 100006394927810, "app_id": 384537191685775, "pages": "105702905593,307851324523,12852567813,480760515417232,288240529145,316774245761,984197758297116,7457442370,207033189701,207346283795,222959748728,207042068180,72983690774,339413234035,343689323559,345828366626,234821559861394,335699426867,10150105039485602,338983127562,364516539001,337922332042,115637335153191,372011535931,333376634908,127590790608884,141923885872653,655037391286291,320774811368833,1740489152861748,469700473093040,386754203367,556449374478585,340999853450,350771491032,1120648627959218,342017778245,338463361591,138772706196968,1641688532739111,326312697536,353120110016,343366744658,335009494554,347261603104,350924013892,257724773860,361203926417,367174215398,284154645394,334501182354,350279743224,154340691263654,147848678611852,361381078011,362831597677,10150095255780118"}, "msvalidate.01": "9451CA04ABC9D1D5C6419C73B4C4F7B7"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/CT-will-follow-CDC-guide-on-treating-anyone-15028979.php"}
