Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is ratcheting up his condemnation of President Trump\u2018s order that lead to the death of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, comparing the killing to Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cassassinating dissidents.\u201d\n\nSanders, who was one of the first 2020 Democrats to call Trump\u2019s airstrike on Soleimani an \u201cassassination,\u201d lobbed harsh criticism against the Trump administration for the killing.\n\n\u201cThis guy, you know, was, as bad as he was, an official of the Iranian government,\u201d Sanders said of Soleimani, in the CNN interview. \u201cAnd, you unleash \u2014 then, if China does that, you know, if Russia does that, you know, Russia has been implicated under Putin with assassinating dissidents.\u201d\n\nSANDERS RIPS BIDEN\u2019S RECORD AS \u2018SO WEAK\u2019 IT WON\u2019T CREATE \u2018EXCITEMENT AND ENERGY\u2019 TO DEFEAT TRUMP\n\nHe continued, \u201cSo, once you\u2019re in the business of assassination, you unleash some very, very terrible forces. And, what I\u2019m seeing now in this world as a result of Trump\u2019s actions, more and more chaos, more and more instability.\u201d\n\nSanders was one of several prominent liberal figures who criticized Trump for ordering the killing of Soleimani.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nActress Rose McGowan tweeted last Friday: \u201cDear #Iran, The USA has disrespected your country, your flag, your people. 52% of us humbly apologize. We want peace with your nation. We are being held hostage by a terrorist regime. We do not know how to escape. Please do not kill us.\u201d\n\nShe later clarified, \u201cOf course #Soleimani was an evil evil man who did evil evil things. But that at this moment is not the f\u2013king point. The United States is morally corrupt and acts illegally. It is only logical to appeal to Iran\u2019s pride by apologizing. I\u2019m taking one for the team. #TeamStayAlive.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "Feed to Post 3.9"}, "canonical_link": "https://1010wcsi.com/fox-politics/sanders-compares-trump-taking-out-soleimani-to-putin-assassinating-dissidents/"}
