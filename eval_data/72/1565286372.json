And because of that many parents are still planning playdates with other kids to keep their little ones busy. But is it safe to allow your kids to go on playdates when it is advised to maintain social distancing?Well, the answer is no. Scheduling a playdate with other kids is not an ideal option to keep your kids busy at this time of crisis. Just because the number of kids getting infected with the virus is low, you should not take things lightly. At this time, children's interaction should be limited to siblings and only to the close members of the family. Inviting anyone at home or visiting someone else's home increases the risk of getting infected from the infectious virus. Children usually display mild or no symptoms of coronavirus , but they can spread the virus to others. This simply means that your child may appear healthy but can pass on the virus to an adult, who may experience serious symptoms of COVID19.Coronavirus is a highly contagious virus. Studies suggest that the virus can exist on some surfaces for days and can remain in the air for up to three hours. Another study indicates that virus can live on plastic and stainless steel for up to three days, and it lingers on wood, glass and paper for four to five days.Looking at the complexity of the situation, it is best to limit your contact with others for a few days. It is essential to understand that restriction has been imposed to curb the growth of the virus and your safety lies in your hand. You can look for other ways to keep your child busy at home during the lockdown.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["lockdown", "Coronavirus outbreak", "coronavirus and parenting", "coronavirus", "Corona Crisis"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Scheduling a playdate with other kids is not an ideal option to keep your kids busy at this time of crisis.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/icons/etfavicon.ico", "meta_data": {"og": {"site_name": "The Times of India", "title": "Corona outbreak: Should children go on playdates? - Times of India", "type": "article", "description": "Scheduling a playdate with other kids is not an ideal option to keep your kids busy at this time of crisis.", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/parenting/toddler-year-and-beyond/corona-outbreak-should-children-go-on-playdates/articleshow/74914878.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74915060,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1120179/74915060.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}}, "fb": {"admins": 556964827, "app_id": 117787264903013, "pages": 26781952138}, "google-site-verification": "ZgFICIedNvVZl5pV9EfAUeenwta9vBY0Za_GgmV4zuw", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia", "title": "Corona outbreak: Should children go on playdates? - Times of India", "description": "Scheduling a playdate with other kids is not an ideal option to keep your kids busy at this time of crisis.", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/parenting/toddler-year-and-beyond/corona-outbreak-should-children-go-on-playdates/articleshow/74914878.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74915060,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1120179/74915060.jpg"}, "news_keywords": "Lifestyle News,lockdown,Coronavirus outbreak,coronavirus and parenting,coronavirus,Corona Crisis", "keywords": "lockdown,Coronavirus outbreak,coronavirus and parenting,coronavirus,Corona Crisis", "article": {"tag": "lockdown", "section": "Life & Style"}, "description": "Scheduling a playdate with other kids is not an ideal option to keep your kids busy at this time of crisis.", "al": {"android": {"url": "toireaderactivities://t/a/74914878", "package": "com.toi.reader.activities", "app_name": "The Times Of India"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height,initial-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no", "robots": "NOODP", "position": 2}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/parenting/toddler-year-and-beyond/corona-outbreak-should-children-go-on-playdates/articleshow/74914878.cms"}
