Musk's announcement was first reported by Electrek.\n\nCongratulations Tesla team on making our 1,000,000th car!! pic.twitter.com/5M99a9LLQi \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2020\n\nThe Model Y will be Tesla's fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings report.\n\nTesla reported that it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year.\n\nTesla is expecting deliveries in 2020 to exceed 500,000 units and for production to outstrip deliveries thanks to Model 3 production in Shanghai and Model Y production in Fremont, California. Model Y production in Shanghai is scheduled for 2021.\n\nTesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 400,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 150,000 Model 3 cars per year.\n\nIt's also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021.\n\nMusk today suggested the Berlin Gigafactory should have a \"mega rave cave\" under the facility with an \"epic sound systems & woofers the size of a car\".\n\nTesla should have a mega rave cave under the Berlin Gigafatory \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2020\n\nGiven Musk's taste for audacious publicity stunts, there's a chance he could build a Tesla underground club in a nod to Berlin's rave culture.\n\nSEE: The new commute: How driverless cars, hyperloop, and drones will change our travel plans (TechRepublic cover story) | Download the PDF version\n\nMusk posted the one million Tesla production milestone a few hours after Tesla shares fell 13.6% to $608 per share as investors fretted over oil output increases announced by Saudi Arabia and Russia this week. The prospect of cheaper petrol over the long term could dampen enthusiasm for electric vehicles in general.\n\nThe other major concern is the impact of the COVID-19 virus on Tesla's Shanghai plant, which the Chinese government ordered to be shut for 10 days from 29 January.\n\nMore on Elon Musk and Tesla electric vehicles", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["CXO", "Tech Industry", "Security", "5G", "IoT", "Smart Cities", "See All Topics", "AI", "Executive Guides", "Digital Transformation", "Cloud", "Coronavirus", "Windows 10", "ZDNet Recommends", "Working from Home", "Innovation", "Topics"], "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Just as oil price wars start, Tesla CEO Elon Musk reveals that his company has made its millionth electric vehicle.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/zdnetcss/images/logos/logo-192x192.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Just as oil price wars start, Tesla CEO Elon Musk reveals that his company has made its millionth electric vehicle.", "og": {"site_name": "ZDNet", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/elon-musk-weve-made-1-million-tesla-electric-cars/", "title": "Elon Musk: We've made 1 million Tesla electric cars | ZDNet", "description": "Just as oil price wars start, Tesla CEO Elon Musk reveals that his company has made its millionth electric vehicle.", "image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/03/10/416ed67a-ddd8-4d33-a9b1-d1d376d16b97/thumbnail/770x578/70d9dec8abf903ffb68c41e3dbd033b0/teslaycnet.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 136759700898}, "author": "Liam Tung", "article": {"author": "https://twitter.com/LiamT"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ZDNet", "creator": "@ZDNet", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/elon-musk-weve-made-1-million-tesla-electric-cars/", "title": "Elon Musk: We've made 1 million Tesla electric cars | ZDNet", "description": "Just as oil price wars start, Tesla CEO Elon Musk reveals that his company has made its millionth electric vehicle.", "image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/03/10/416ed67a-ddd8-4d33-a9b1-d1d376d16b97/thumbnail/770x578/70d9dec8abf903ffb68c41e3dbd033b0/teslaycnet.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#080e14"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/elon-musk-weve-made-1-million-tesla-electric-cars/"}
