The result was a complete and utter fiasco.\n\nCustomers were unable to log into their accounts. Data from some customer accounts appeared in different ones. Obscure technical error messages abounded. Customers overwhelmed call centers to the point that beleaguered call center reps walked off the job.\n\nIn an effort to stanch the bleeding, the bank waived tens of millions of pounds\u2019 worth of overdraft fees and increased interest payments to cover customer losses.\n\nAt the center of this ill-fated initiative was a migration from a mishmash of legacy apps to a modern suite of applications, in part in the public cloud. Nevertheless, in spite of the noble goal to migrate legacy apps to the cloud, the effort was as one insider described, \u201ca clusterfuck in the making.\u201d\n\nHow could such an effort go so wrong? And perhaps more to the point, how can you avoid your cloud migration suffering a similar fate?\n\nDan Foy\n\nFiasco Years in the Making\n\nLloyd\u2019s Bank in the UK spun off Trustee Savings Bank (now TSB) after the 2008 financial crisis. Even as an independent bank, however, it continued to use Lloyd\u2019s aging IT platform, which consisted of a mix of older apps that Lloyd\u2019s had acquired over several years of bank acquisitions.\n\nIn 2015, Spain\u2019s Banco Sabadell acquired TSB for \u00a31.7 billion (about $2.2 billion), but it remained on the legacy platform. Migrating to a new platform, however, was an urgent priority, as TSB was paying Lloyds as much as \u00a3220 million ($286 million) per year to Lloyd\u2019s for use of its platform.\n\nTo this end, Sabadell decided to migrate TSB\u2019s application infrastructure to its own Proteo platform, which was based on Accenture \u2019s COBOL-based Alnova system. Sabadell, however, had heavily customized this platform over the years.\n\nTSB planned to heavily customize Proteo even further for its own purposes, as well as migrating it (at least in part) to the AWS cloud from Amazon.com . The bank dubbed the result Proteo4UK.\n\nBy late 2017, TSB leadership was sanguine about Proteo4UK. \u201cWe have created a more digital, agile and flexible TSB,\u201d crowed Paul Pester, CEO of TSB.\n\nThe bank played up the speed of the migration. \u201cWe have a great partnership with Sabadell and the development team in Barcelona,\u201d said Genevieve Kangurs from the Digital Transformation Office at TSB. She said that Proteo4UK boasted \u201cspeed, adaptability and flexibility unheard of before.\u201d\n\nSabadell leadership was equally sanguine. \u201cWith this migration, Sabadell has proven its technological management capacity, not only in national migrations but also on an international scale,\u201d bragged Josep Oliu, Chariman of Banco Sabadell.\n\nFell Over Right Away\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for people to realize such confidence was unwarranted. Within hours of TSB flipping the switch on Proteo4UK in April 2018, the system came to a screaming halt, locking out up to 1.9 million TSB customers \u2013 and problems persisted well into the following week.\n\nThe same insider at the bank spoke to The Guardian about the situation in the weeks following the debacle. \u201cIt seemed a bad fit for a smaller bank to inherit all the problems of a bloated mess to service far fewer customers,\u201d said the insider. \u201cI could have put money on the rollout being the disaster it has been, with evidence of major code changes on the hoof over last weekend and into this week.\u201d\n\nThe insider had more to say. \u201cThe time period to develop the new system and migrate TSB over to it was just 18 months,\u201d the insider added. \u201cIt was unbelievable \u2013 hardly even a prototype or proof of concept, yet it was supposed to be fully tested and working by May [2018] before the integration work started.\u201d\n\nCustomers were livid. Here is one tweet among hundreds. \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse as the day goes on,\u201d tweeted Jobseeker (@Anonymous_Nottz). \u201cI can\u2019t login online at all now!! I\u2019m locked out of the app as its trying to text me on a number I changed 3 years ago.\u201d\n\nAvoiding Your Own Migration Fiasco\n\nTSB made many mistakes, including an overly aggressive timeline, inadequate testing, and an untold number of technical faux pas. As with many legacy migration efforts, however, the biggest mistake was tackling the entire effort as a single \u2018big bang\u2019 initiative.\n\nMany organizations face the choice between two risky alternatives. \u201cToday, enterprises making the shift to the cloud face two options: The first option is to \u2018lift and shift,\u2019 moving applications to the cloud as they are currently running on premises, and moving all the headaches to the cloud too,\u201d explained Google vice president of technical infrastructure, Urs H\u00f6lzle. \u201cOr it\u2019s a very scary transition, where you have to rewrite a lot of things.\u201d\n\nTSB bet on the latter choice, which was perhaps their primary mistake. Fortunately, many organizations are learning this lesson. \u201cNot long ago, many enterprise teams we spoke with believed there were only two ways to deal with existing applications \u2013 rearchitect them for the cloud, or keep them on-premises indefinitely. But that\u2019s a false choice,\u201d explained Dan Jones, VP of Product for Skytap. \u201cSmart IT teams understand the cloud has benefits for many application types and that rearchitecting isn\u2019t always necessary, or even advisable, to gain those advantages.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, rewriting apps for the cloud does make sense \u2013 but it\u2019s important to take a gradual approach. \u201cRebuilding your app to take advantage of cloud features can help you realise reduced costs, reduced risk and less need for operational support,\u201d said Richard Latham, principal consultant at KCOM. \u201cTrying to do everything at once runs the risk of slowing down the entire migration process, multiplying costs and can even delay implementation by as much as several years.\u201d\n\nThe bigger the migration effort, the more can go wrong. \u201cTypical migration solutions are high risk and can take years to complete. This is because altering programs and applications can require writing thousands, and in some cases, millions of lines of code, meaning that the scope for error is far-reaching,\u201d said Carl Davies, managing director at TmaxSoft UK. And yet, \u201ccloud-based architectures are certainly possible and offer tremendous flexibility. Almost all forms of processing are now moving to open systems made possible by the cloud.\u201d\n\nFailure may sink the entire business \u2013 an eventuality that may or may not be in the cards for TSB. Success, however, can lead to strategic benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to merely shift applications and infrastructure to the cloud. By critically evaluating the options for the whole business, companies can benefit from opportunities to advance or extend their business models and stakeholder experiences,\u201d explained Suranjan Chatterjee, global head of cloud apps, microservices & API-fication Unit at Tata Consultancy Services . \u201cWhen executives emphasise business drivers in their decision-making to move away from legacy systems, it will open up cloud opportunities beyond cutting capital expenses, ending software maintenance contracts and reducing IT staff.\u201d\n\nPostscript: Will TSB Survive?\n\nTSB\u2019s failed migration gave them both a customer relations nightmare as well as a technical quagmire they have had to clean up quickly.\n\nThe cost of the fiasco (outside of the technical fixes) may end up costing TSB as much as \u00a3150 million ($195 million), according to Mark Brown, who heads up TBU, a union that represents many TSB employees. This number includes compensation to customers, fines, increased costs, and lost business \u2013 as well as addressing rampant fraud, as criminals have been quick to take advantage of the situation.\n\nTo clean up the technical mess \u2013 and most importantly, the sorry state the fiasco had put the bank\u2019s data in \u2013 TSB hired IBM .\n\nIBM\u2019s estimated cost? As much as \u00a3955 million ($1.26 billion), according to an article on Wolf Street. This number includes the technical fixes and cleaning up the data mess. Compared to the \u00a31.7 billion purchase price for TSB, these numbers would suggest that the fix may not be worth the trouble, customers be damned.\n\nOnly time will tell \u2013 but the moral of this story is clear. Cloud or no, IT migration promises both substantial upside and commensurate risk. There are no panaceas, and it is all too easy to oversimplify the alternatives.\n\nAnd most of all? Know what you\u2019re getting yourself into. \u201cWhere is the problem simply about infrastructure \u2013 which is the case for many traditional, scale-up apps \u2013 and where is the issue an app\u2019s functionality?\u201d asks Skytap\u2019s Jones. \u201cThe answers are critical to creating a cloud strategy that actually solves your problems and delivers measurable value.\u201d\n\nIntellyx publishes the Agile Digital Transformation Roadmap poster, advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives, and helps vendors communicate their agility stories.
