She was then found to have been infected with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and transferred to hospital.\n\nThe traveler said she visited a local fresh market in Wuhan on a regular basis prior to the onset of illness on Jan. 5, but did not go to Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where most of the cases were detected.\n\nThe WHO said the patient is in a stable condition and her full exposure history is still under investigation.\n\nSince the initial report of cases in Wuhan on Dec. 31, 41 cases with novel coronavirus infection have been preliminarily diagnosed, including one case that died with severe underlying medical conditions. No additional cases have been detected since Jan. 3 in China.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan 15 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"publishid": "138706210.11.3.0", "pageid": "2.4.0.0.11110320.0.0.0.0.0.113536.138706210", "renderer": "webkit", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no", "format-detection": "email=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no"}, "canonical_link": ""}
