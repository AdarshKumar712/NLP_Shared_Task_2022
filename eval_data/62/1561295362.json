He said they ignore U.S. ally Colombia\u2019s role as the main source of the world\u2019s cocaine and his own role in facilitating peace talks between Colombia\u2019s government and that country\u2019s rebels over the past decade. \u201cDonald Trump, you are a miserable human being,\u201d Maduro railed during his televised address. \u201cYou manage international relations like a New York mafia extortion artist you once were as a real estate boss.\u201d\n\nWhat was some of Maduro\u2019s most venomous rhetoric ever against Trump also came with a threat of military force: \u201cIf one day the imperialists and Colombian oligarchy dare to touch even a single hair, they will face the Bolivarian fury of an entire nation that will wipe them all out.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Venezuela\u2019s chief prosecutor opened an investigation against opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 for allegedly plotting a coup with retired army Gen. Cliver Alcal\u00e1, who after being named in the U.S. indictments said he had stockpiled assault weapons in Colombia for a cross-border incursion. Without offering evidence, Maduro said the Drug Enforcement Administration was behind a plan by Alcal\u00e1 to assassinate him and other political leaders. The indictment of a functioning head of state is highly unusual and is bound to ratchet up tensions with Washington as the spread of the coronavirus threatens to collapse Venezuela\u2019s shortage-plagued health system.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["defiant", "maduro", "threatens", "cowboy", "trump", "drug", "charge"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "MIAMI: Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro stood defiant in the face of a $15 million bounty by the U.S. to face drug trafficking charges, calling Donald Trump a \u201cracist cowboy\u201d...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "TITLE": "Defiant Maduro threatens \u2018cowboy\u2019 Trump after drug charge | World | thenews.com.pk", "description": "MIAMI: Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro stood defiant in the face of a $15 million bounty by the U.S. to face drug trafficking charges, calling Donald Trump a \u201cracist cowboy\u201d...", "keywords": "defiant,maduro,threatens,cowboy,trump,drug,charge", "fb": {"app_id": 650123461797330}, "og": {"title": "Defiant Maduro threatens \u2018cowboy\u2019 Trump after drug charge", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 390}, "description": "MIAMI: Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro stood defiant in the face of a $15 million bounty by the U.S. to face drug trafficking charges, calling Donald Trump a \u201cracist cowboy\u201d...", "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/635552-defiant-maduro-threatens-cowboy-trump-after-drug-charge", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thenews_intl", "creator": "@NNewsdesk", "title": "Defiant Maduro threatens \u2018cowboy\u2019 Trump after drug charge", "description": "MIAMI: Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro stood defiant in the face of a $15 million bounty by the U.S. to face drug trafficking charges, calling Donald Trump a \u201cracist cowboy\u201d...", "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=031733"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The News International", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#333333", "theme-color": "#000000"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/635552-defiant-maduro-threatens-cowboy-trump-after-drug-charge"}
