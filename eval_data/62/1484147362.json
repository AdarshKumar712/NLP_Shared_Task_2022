ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos\n\nHoliday parties, birthdays, reunions. These are all beautiful occasions to gather with our friends and loved ones, celebrate all the good things in our lives, raise our glasses to the bad ones, and drink for what\u2019s to come. It\u2019d be nice if we could do all that without a horrible, head-wracking hangover.\n\nBefore you start scheduling hangover recovery time on your holiday calendar, know there are things you can do to make that bottle-ache a bit milder. And that\u2019s the best-case scenario, because we\u2019re sorry to tell you one cold, hard fact: there is no cure for hangovers. Like, none. Zero.\n\nWhat do you mean there\u2019s no cure for hangovers?\n\nExactly that, actually. For starters, science still doesn\u2019t quite know what causes a hangover. Literature on the subject has identified three possible culprits: the direct effect of alcohol on the brain and other organs, the effects of alcohol withdrawal from these organs; and other non-alcoholic factors, such as the physiological effects of compounds created when the body processes alcohol, like methanol.\n\nIt\u2019s also challenging to define what a hangover is. The definition researchers generally agree upon is that it\u2019s a condition characterized by a feeling of misery that can last up to 24 hours after the amount of alcohol in your blood drops to zero. As anyone who\u2019s ever experienced a hangover will tell you, symptoms can vary both in nature and intensity, going from headache, nausea, and fatigue, to muscle aches, vomiting, lack of concentration, and anxiety.\n\nThe symptoms you experience after a night of drinking will depend on multiple factors, like how much you drank, for how long, what it was, if you ate, what kind of food you devoured, if you danced, or smoked, and more. And that\u2019s not even taking into account genetic predisposition to hangovers or family history regarding alcohol addiction.\n\nConsidering these effects vary widely from person to person\u2014and even from one hangover to another\u2014it is very hard to study them, which makes hangovers a tough nut to crack. And then there\u2019s the morality of curing them.\n\n\u201cA possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior,\u201d Utrecht University researchers Joris C. Verster and Renske Penning wrote in their 2010 paper Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover.\n\nAccording to them, it is possible that part of the scientific community may not want to find a cure for hangovers because doing so would make binge drinking that much easier.\n\nOk, so how do I deal with a hangover?\n\nIt's definitely easier to avoid a hangover than to cure it. ArturVerkhovetskiy via Deposit Photos\n\nSince we don\u2019t know what causes hangovers, there\u2019s no drug or homemade remedy that will get rid of one entirely. In fact, the only scientifically proven method to avoid a hangover is moderate alcohol consumption or good old abstinence.\n\nBut since it is likely you will eventually have to deal with at least one hangover, it\u2019s a good idea to know there are things you can do to make the day after a party a little less miserable.\n\nRehydrate\n\nDehydration is one of the main symptoms of hangovers. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing water and resulting in the overproduction of urine. Add that to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea (all possible hangover symptoms), and you end up with a sure case of dehydration.\n\nDrinking one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you consume is a great way to prevent a bad hangover. If that ship has already sailed and you\u2019re experiencing hangover-induced dehydration, you can always opt for a sports drink or make your own oral rehydration salts. All you need to do is mix two tablespoons of sugar and a 3/4 teaspoon of salt in four cups of water. Doing so will not only help you get that precious water back into your body, but will also restore your electrolytes.\n\nBeware of congeners\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever experienced a red wine-induced hangover, you know they\u2019re some of the worst you can get, and congeners are to blame. These are the biologically active compounds that give alcoholic beverages their distinct taste, smell, and color. Research shows a higher concentration of congeners may have something to do with more severe hangovers, whereas drinking distilled spirits containing purer ethanol, such as vodka or gin, will result in milder or fewer hangover effects.\n\nWhen it comes to avoiding hangovers, the lighter the color, the better\u2014stay away from rum, whiskey, tequila and red wine, which are among the alcoholic drinks with higher amounts of congeners.\n\nSleep well\n\nFatigue and muscle aches are two of the most common hangover symptoms, and you don\u2019t have to be a doctor to know the best way to treat them: rest. But alcohol consumption disrupts sleep patterns, resulting in both less and worse sleep. Drinking also alters your circadian rhythm, which raises cortisol levels and causes a feeling similar to jet lag.\n\nIt might be difficult, but a good way to combat a hangover is just to sleep. Give yourself the time to get some rest and bounce back. And if you made the horrible decision of making plans for early the next day, God help you.\n\nBe careful when taking Aspirin or paracetamol\n\nWhen you\u2019re suffering from a hangover that features an intense headache, your first instinct may be to take Aspirin or paracetamol. Studies have shown alcohol can cause an inflammatory response in the body, so anti-inflammatory drugs such as these could have a positive effect.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Holiday parties, birthdays, reunions.
