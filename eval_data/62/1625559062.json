German Economy Peter Altmaier said that the aim is \u201cnothing less than a European moonshot in digital policy.\u201d\n\nGermany and France will set up a non-profit association to coordinate and organize the data infrastructure, Altmaier said. Conceived last year and initially announced in October, GAIA-X follows on the heels of an existing push by the European Union\u2019s two biggest economies to set up a car battery consortium aimed at catching up with Asian rivals.\n\nThe cloud computing project \u201ccould not have been more timely\u201d as Europe tries to dig itself out of a deep recession caused by the coronavirus crisis, French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said.\n\n\u201cWith the COVID crisis, companies massively shifted to teleworking. This makes the need for (a) secure and European cloud solution all the more urgent,\u201d Le Maire told a news conference by video link from Paris.\n\n\u201cThe crisis also showed that the giant tech companies are the winners \u2026 the European digital space has to be protected,\u201d he added, pledging that the new platform \u201cwill ensure the application of policy rules based on EU values and standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not China, we are not the United States \u2014 we are European countries with our own values and our own economic interests that we want to defend,\u201d Le Maire said. He stressed the importance of \u201cinteroperability,\u201d allowing companies to switch easily to the new system without losing any data.\n\nThe two ministers said the project has brought together 22 companies in France and Germany, including Dassault Systemes, Orange, Siemens, SAP, Robert Bosch and Deutsche Telekom. They didn\u2019t give financial details. Le Maire called on \u201call other European companies and countries\u201d to join the initiative.\n\nBeyond that, \u201cthe idea is that we invite companies across the world providing their cloud services according to European standards and rules,\u201d Altmaier said. \u201cEveryone who wants to have the label of GAIA-X will have to respect and to satisfy several sets of rules,\u201d including on interoperability and data migration.\n\nHe said that the project\u2019s success \u201cwill be crucial for Germany, for France and for Europe as far as our economic strength, our competitivity and our sovereignty are concerned.\u201d\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Associated Press.
