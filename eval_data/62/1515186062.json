And the barbs were sharper when they were aimed at the two men who finished the first nominating contest, in Iowa, in a virtual tie.\n\nFormer South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has gotten a big boost in polls after his astonishingly strong showing in Iowa's caucuses, got it from a few competitors. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont slammed him for taking campaign cash from billionaires.\n\nCartoons on the 2020 Election View All 174 Images\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota referred to him obliquely as the ''cool newcomer,'' adding, ''I just don't think that's what people want right now. We have a newcomer in the White House. And look where it got us. I think having some experience is a good thing.''\n\nSanders, who effectively tied Butigieg in Iowa and is seeing his clear first-place standing in New Hampshire polls erode with Buttigieg's surge, took his hits as well. Former Vice President Joe Biden noted of his longtime Senate colleague that ''Bernie's labeled himself \u2013 not me \u2013 a democratic socialist\" and would be cast that way, along with down-ticket Democrats, by President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden also criticized Sanders for his record on gun control, noting that Sanders had voted in the past against national background checks and for legislation that protected gun manufacturers from lawsuits if their products were used in crimes. Sanders responded that he was representing his home state, largely rural Vermont, and was proud of his current, D-minus rating by the National Rifle Association.\n\nButtigieg got in on it, too, saying the ''my way or the highway'' approach would not unite the country. Asked directly if he was referring to Sanders, Buttigieg said, ''yes.''\n\nAll of that brought exasperated responses from the two men at the end of the stage, businessmen Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer, who pleaded with the contenders to focus on the economy and coming up with a united and clear strategy to defeat Trump.\n\nAnd many were happy to go gleefully after a candidate who wasn't even on the stage and hadn't even tried to be: former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is deliberately skipping the first four nominating contests in hopes of a big showing Super Tuesday on March 3.\n\nWhile the other candidates have been forced to wheedle supporters for campaign cash as they embark on the grueling process of campaigning in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, Bloomberg has been running slick and expensive TV ads in places the others can barely afford to be present. And the resentment over that was clear Friday night.\n\n''I guess if you're worth $60 billion and you can spend several hundred million dollars on commercials, you have a slight advantage. That is nonsense,\" Sanders said.\n\n''I don't believe anyone ought to be able to buy their way into the nomination'' or to the White House, Warren said with more than a tinge of anger in her voice. She used the opportunity, too, to take a not-so-veiled shot at Buttigieg, who has been criticized by challengers for taking donations from the wealthy.\n\n''I don't think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns ought to be able to do it,'' she added. ''Everyone on this stage except Amy and me is a billionaire or receiving help from Super PACs. Time to put your money where your mouth is and say no to the PACs.''\n\nButtigieg \u2013 who with an estimated net worth of $100,000 is the least well off of those onstage \u2013 appeared baffled.\n\n\"Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is not exactly an establishment fundraising powerhouse,'' Buttigieg said. He noted that he had raised a lot of money from online donors.\n\nBoth Biden and Klobuchar had fiery performances. Biden, who has alternated from an affable ''Uncle Joe'' demeanor to a more forceful and critical competitor, showed more fire Friday night as he sought to recover from a disappointing showing in Iowa. Klobuchar delivered a strong performance, noting Buttigieg's lack of experience and her own success passing bills and winning in red districts. But it's unclear whether Klobuchar, who has inched up in polls after doing well in other debates, can break into the top three or even the top four as the race for votes and campaign cash gets harder.\n\nThe contenders were hoping to move the needle in New Hampshire but also clearly looking ahead to Nevada and South Carolina. Biden, Steyer and Sanders got into a sort of competition over who had more endorsements from African Americans \u2013 important in South Carolina, where the Democratic electorate is about 60% black.\n\nAsked what to do about racial discrimination, the candidates went on at length about their proposals for education, housing and criminal justice reform \u2013 all things they said could alleviate the problem.\n\nYang, the only non-white candidate onstage, was blunt and dismissive of the question.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Susan Milligan", "2020 presidential election", "debates", "Sanders", "Bernie", "National News", "Politics", "America 2020"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Feb.", "At P.M.", "Read More"], "publish_date": "Fri Feb  7 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The presidential candidates turned on each other in fiery exchanges often aimed at top Iowa finishers Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/static/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "The presidential candidates turned on each other in fiery exchanges often aimed at top Iowa finishers Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders.", "keywords": "Susan Milligan,2020 presidential election,debates,Sanders, Bernie,National News,Politics,America 2020", "site": "news", "zone": "home/articles", "fb": {"pages": 5834919267, "app_id": 130063997038366}, "og": {"title": "Democrats on the Attack in New Hampshire Debate", "description": "The presidential candidates turned on each other in fiery exchanges often aimed at top Iowa finishers Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders.", "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/85c76bd/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fee%2Fd1%2Ff402e5a64dd8b6a68d5db0abbc3b%2F200207-debate3-editorial.jpg", "type": "article", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "url": "https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2020-02-07/democrats-on-the-attack-in-new-hampshire-debate"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/85c76bd/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fee%2Fd1%2Ff402e5a64dd8b6a68d5db0abbc3b%2F200207-debate3-editorial.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@USNews", "title": "Democrats on the Attack in New Hampshire Debate", "description": "The presidential candidates turned on each other in fiery exchanges often aimed at top Iowa finishers Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders."}, "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "optimizely": "Optimizely is supported by this application but is not enabled for this page."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2020-02-07/democrats-on-the-attack-in-new-hampshire-debate"}
