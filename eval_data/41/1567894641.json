Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s administration has requested an emergency supply of the drugs President Trump touted as having success treating patients with severe symptoms of the novel coronavirus, in a reversal from the state\u2019s directive to medical professionals last week to avoid the medication for this purpose.\n\nMichigan, this week, requested hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile for physicians to use to help treat patients with COVID-19, after the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend granted an emergency use authorization for the anti-malarial drugs.\n\nBut last week, Whitmer\u2019s administration threatened physicians prescribing the drugs, saying they were subject to \u201cadministrative action\u201d should they continue to use the medication.\n\nTrending: Biden: \u2018No amendment to the Constitution is absolute.\u2019 Got your amendments right here, Mr. President\n\n\u201cThe Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs has received multiple allegations of Michigan physicians inappropriately prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. \u2026", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Gabe Kaminsky", "Federalist", "Mandy Velez", "Daily Beast", "Mark David", "Dirt", "Sam Dorman", "Fox News", "Kristine Marsh", "Newsbusters"], "publish_date": "Fri Apr  3 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "robots": "noimageindex", "googlebot": "noimageindex", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Michigan governor reverses course on Trump-touted coronavirus drugs - Liberty Unyielding", "description": "Brooke Singman, Fox News", "url": "https://libertyunyielding.com/2020/04/03/michigan-governor-reverses-course-on-trump-touted-coronavirus-drugs/", "site_name": "Liberty Unyielding", "image": {"identifier": "https://libertyunyielding.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Michigans-Governor-elect-Gretchen-Whitmer-1200x630.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/LibertyUnyielding", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/LibertyUnyielding", "published_time": "2020-04-03T15:05:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-04-03T13:23:31+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 825695570796997, "pages": 350154138430441}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/libertyunyieldi", "site": "@LibertyUnyieldi"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2"}, "canonical_link": "https://libertyunyielding.com/2020/04/03/michigan-governor-reverses-course-on-trump-touted-coronavirus-drugs/"}
