And very soon. In a movie that we\u2019re shooting right now.\u201d\n\nNow, according to two sources close to the studio, Feige only intended to respond to the first part about LGBT+ characters, and he did not mean to imply that a trans character will be coming to the MCU very soon, reports variety.com.\n\nAt the time of his appearance in December, the only MCU movie in production was Eternals from director Chloe Zhao. In August, Feige confirmed that the film, which features Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kumail Nanjiani, Gemma Chan, Kit Harington, Barry Keoghan and Brian Tyree Henry, will have the MCU\u2019s first major gay character.
