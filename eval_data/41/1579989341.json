The lockdowns and restrictions on movements due to the virus around the world have delivered a significant blow to the global economy.\n\nCoates, who is the chairman of the Tokyo 2020 Coordination Commission, said that Japan like most countries could face a recession due to the pandemic and the Olympics is a good opportunity for them to make some recoveries.\n\n\u201cIf Japan is anywhere like the rest of the world where there is an economic downturn, a recession maybe, these Games are a very positive opportunity to be an economic stimulus,\u201d Coates told reporters via a press conference on Youtube after an IOC and Tokyo 2020 executive project review meeting.\n\n\u201cThese Games can be how you can kick-start the economy again. These Games can be the rebirth of the tourism industry and provide opportunities for your hotel operators and airlines.\n\n\u201cThey will obviously provide jobs, with new events in the spring. Yes, there will be some negative impacts,\u201d he said.\n\nCoates also said that Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe must have had all this in mind when a postponement to next year was proposed initially.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Abe is a very smart man and I have no doubt that when he proposed we postpone the Games for one year, he had in mind the positive economic stimulus this would provide for Tokyo and Japan in what would otherwise be a downturn.\n\n\u201cI think there would be a lot of other cities and countries around the world wishing for a similar opportunity. These are the sorts of things world leaders are considering at the moment, projects which can kick-start economies.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Abe is a leader in the world and I am suspecting this might have been in his mind.\u201d\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics is set to be held from July 23 to August 8, 2021.\n\n\u2013IANS\n\nrkm/bbh", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["recession", "olympics", "japan", "stimulus", "economic"], "authors": ["Canindia New Wire Service"], "publish_date": "Thu Apr 16 13:08:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Canada's Favourite South Asian Newspaper!
