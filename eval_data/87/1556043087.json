The video goes behind-the-scenes of the R-rated DC flick, delving into the origins of the script, the hiring of director Cathy Yan, the fight scenes, and more. It\u2019s a crash-course in a crazy film that will hopefully find a larger audience on digital than it did in theaters.\n\nBirds of Prey Featurette\n\nBirds of Prey is a lot of fun. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best of the recent DC films, but it\u2019s certainly plenty entertaining \u2013 and deserved a much better reception than it got in theaters. Now, Warner Bros. is gearing up to drop the movie onto digital early, and I\u2019m hopeful more folks will discover it there. If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, and want some indication of the tone of the flick, you might want to check out the featurette above. It\u2019s pretty extensive \u2013 it runs a little over 8 minutes \u2013 and covers a lot of bases. Star Margot Robbie talks about how she pitched the entire idea for the film, and then met with screenwriter Christina Hodson about the project. From there we learn about Cathy Yan being brought on to direct the film, the casting, the action, and more. This is actually one of several features included on the home media release. Here\u2019s a full list of what else is included.\n\nBirds Eye View Mode\n\nBirds of Prey: Birds of a Feather\n\nGrime and Crime\n\nWild Nerds\n\nRomanesque\n\nSanity is Sooo Last Season\n\nA Love/Skate Relationship\n\nGag Reel\n\nOn March 24, Birds of Prey will be available to own in high definition and standard definition from select digital retailers including Amazon, FandangoNOW, iTunes, PlayStation, Vudu, Xbox and others. And then on April 7, Birds of Prey will be made available digitally on Video On Demand services from cable and satellite providers, and on select gaming consoles.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["birds of prey"], "authors": ["Chris Evangelista"], "publish_date": "Sun Mar 22 09:00:51 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Go behind-the-scenes of Birds of Prey with a new featurette that's one of the special features included on the home media release.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/slashfilm/siteimages/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 254451208349115}, "description": "Go behind-the-scenes of Birds of Prey with a new featurette that's one of the special features included on the home media release.", "news_keywords": "birds of prey, movies, film, tv", "original-source": "https://www.slashfilm.com/birds-of-prey-featurette-new/", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Birds of Prey' Featurette: Go Behind-the-Scenes Ahead of Next Week's Digital Release", "description": "Go behind-the-scenes of Birds of Prey with a new featurette that's one of the special features included on the home media release.", "url": "https://www.slashfilm.com/birds-of-prey-featurette-new/", "site_name": "/Film", "updated_time": "2020-03-21T08:57:16-07:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/birds-of-prey-featurette-new.jpg", "secure_url": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/birds-of-prey-featurette-new.jpg", "width": 948, "height": 435, "alt": "birds of prey featurette new"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/slashfilm", "tag": "birds of prey", "section": "Comic Book/Superhero", "published_time": "2020-03-22T09:00:51-07:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-21T08:57:16-07:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Go behind-the-scenes of Birds of Prey with a new featurette that's one of the special features included on the home media release.", "title": "'Birds of Prey' Featurette: Go Behind-the-Scenes Ahead of Next Week's Digital Release", "site": "@slashfilm", "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/birds-of-prey-featurette-new.jpg", "creator": "@cevangelista413"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-270x270.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.slashfilm.com/birds-of-prey-featurette-new/"}
