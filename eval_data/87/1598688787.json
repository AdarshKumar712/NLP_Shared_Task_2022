And we\u2019ve already begun to talk about a transition plan with FEMA.\u201d Pence added, \u201cWe\u2019re starting to look at the Memorial Day window, early June window as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies begin to manage \u2014 begin to manage our national response in a more traditional manner.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has shown an eagerness for the country to get back to work, expressing optimism that the virus can be successfully contained; however the rate of new infections continues to rise in much of the country, even as some early U.S. hotspots have begun to bring the virus under control.\n\nEditorial credit: Michael Candelori / Shutterstock.com", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Posted"], "publish_date": "Wed May  6 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "White House To Wind Down Coronavirus Task Force To Focus On Covid-19 Treatments, Economic Reopening", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "White House To Wind Down Coronavirus Task Force To Focus On Covid-19 Treatments, Economic Reopening", "SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "og": {"site_name": "KTTS", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article", "image": "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/1028/2020/05/06100502/tmp687b74b7-6b55-4575-aa9e-0b2a38083b05.jpg", "title": "White House To Wind Down Coronavirus Task Force To Focus On Covid-19 Treatments, Economic Reopening", "url": "https://www.ktts.com/2020/05/06/white-house-to-wind-down-coronavirus-task-force-to-focus-on-covid-19-treatments-economic-reopening/", "description": "The White House coronavirus task force is set to wind down in the weeks ahead as the administration looks to shift focus from the day-to-day public health response toward an economic reopening of the country.
