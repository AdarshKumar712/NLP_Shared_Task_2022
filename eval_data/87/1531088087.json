The investor and activist qualified for the 10th Democratic debate after increasing his poll numbers in South Carolina, which holds its primary Saturday.\n\nSteyer\u2019s comment highlights the backlash faced by the other billionaire Democratic candidate in the race, Michael Bloomberg, over his history of having at least three former female employees sign nondisclosure agreements related to alleged offensive comments he made. During the last debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., pointedly criticized Bloomberg for the agreements and accused him of buying his way onto the stage through a blitz of political advertising.\n\nSteyer, who didn\u2019t qualify for the last debate, told the PBS NewsHour that spending time discussing nondisclosure agreements are a distraction.\n\n\u201cThe attitude you have towards women matters,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cIf you could show that there was something really wrong, that really matters. But something that says, \u2018There could have been something wrong,\u2019 and they have a nondisclosure agreement\u2013 I don\u2019t think that rises to the level of a presidential debate.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: 6 takeaways from the Las Vegas Democratic debate\n\nSteyer said he felt that Trump \u201cwon\u201d the last debate because \u201cpeople spent their time talking about minor, irrelevant points to try and tear each other down, when in fact the real question is, what you are going to do for the American people that\u2019s different and better?\u201d\n\nAfter Steyer poured millions of dollars of his own personal wealth into running ads and hiring campaign staff in South Carolina, he said he, too, expects to be attacked by some candidates over his affluence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize for being a success,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cIf I were a person who is totally self-absorbed and selfish, then I\u2019d have something to be embarrassed about. I\u2019m not embarrassed about starting a business, succeeding in a business and using everything I can to try and work for the American people. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nEarly on in its history, his hedge fund invested in fossil fuels and private prisons\u2013 two sectors criticized by many Democrats. When asked if those investments were a mistake, Steyer affirmed that it was, and that he had corrected it on his own by disinvesting in those industries. \u201cI really care about these issues,\u201d he said, adding that attacks based on that history \u201care low political blows.\u201d\n\nA poll released Monday by NBC news and Marist shows former Vice President Joe Biden leading in South Carolina with 27 percent of support. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, currently seen as the Democratic front-runner, is just four points behind. Steyer is in third place with 15 percent.\n\nWATCH: Buttigieg vows to focus on diversity ahead of South Carolina\n\nTo Steyer, criticism of his spending in South Carolina is offensive to the black voters who make up the majority of Democratic primary voters in the state \u2014 and with whom he has made inroads.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out here renting rooms and hiring people to work,\u201d Steyer said of his campaign operation. \u201cEvery time somebody hires a black person and they go into a community, somehow that\u2019s buying influence. No one ever says that when you go and hire white people.\u201d\n\nSteyer said that \u201cthe implication is that black people are there to be bought and that we\u2019re trying to do it, that\u2019s not true,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do when you organize politically. You get people from the community, you hire staff in the community so you can work in the community.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Essays", "tom steyer", "south carolina", "ScienceScope", "Supreme Court", "Innovation and Invention", "Politics Monday", "The Leading Edge", "Basic Research", "Teachers' Lounge", "Race Matters", "democratic debates", "vote 2020", "Long-Term Care", "Shields and Brooks"], "authors": ["Yamiche Alcindor", "Meredith Lee"], "publish_date": "Tue Feb 25 16:56:27 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Tom Steyer, qualified for the 10th Democratic debate after increasing his poll numbers in South Carolina, told the PBS NewsHour that attacks against Michael Bloomberg over the nondisclosure agreements are a distraction.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/ios/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Tom Steyer, qualified for the 10th Democratic debate after increasing his poll numbers in South Carolina, told the PBS NewsHour that attacks against Michael Bloomberg over the nondisclosure agreements are a distraction.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "title": "WATCH: Steyer says NDAs should not be a presidential debate focus", "description": "Tom Steyer, qualified for the 10th Democratic debate after increasing his poll numbers in South Carolina, told the PBS NewsHour that attacks against Michael Bloomberg over the nondisclosure agreements are a distraction.", "image": {"identifier": "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/02/2020-02-24T012303Z_205116571_RC2P6F9K5X9A_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-STEYER-1024x683.jpg", "height": 683, "width": 1024}, "url": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-steyer-says-ndas-should-not-be-a-presidential-debate-focus"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour/", "published_time": "2020-02-25T16:56:27-05:00", "section": "Politics", "tag": "democratic debates, south carolina, tom steyer, vote 2020"}, "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116, "pages": 6491828674}, "twitter": {"site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "WATCH: Steyer says NDAs should not be a presidential debate focus", "description": "Tom Steyer, qualified for the 10th Democratic debate after increasing his poll numbers in South Carolina, told the PBS NewsHour that attacks against Michael Bloomberg over the nondisclosure agreements are a distraction.", "image": "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/02/2020-02-24T012303Z_205116571_RC2P6F9K5X9A_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-STEYER-1024x683.jpg"}, "news_keywords": "democratic debates, south carolina, tom steyer, vote 2020, politics", "msapplication-config": "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-steyer-says-ndas-should-not-be-a-presidential-debate-focus"}
