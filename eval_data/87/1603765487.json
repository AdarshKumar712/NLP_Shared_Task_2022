They were discovered living in Hawaii in January, though they may have been living there for weeks prior.\n\nMelani said in the interview that she had not seen the children in person since they were packing up to move from their Chandler, Arizona, home late this summer, weeks after Vallow\u2019s previous husband Charles Vallow was shot and killed by Lori\u2019s brother Alex, who claimed self-defense. Melani said that Vallow and her children moved to Rexburg from Arizona just ahead of the start of the school year, and that at her aunt\u2019s urging, Melani followed in early November, with at least one visit to Rexburg during the time Lori lived there.\n\nFrom the interview:\n\n\u201c[Lori] said, \u2018Just come. Try out somewhere new and come see if you like it up here.\u2019 We toured BYU-Idaho and she said Tylee was with friends. [Tylee] always was with friends so I didn\u2019t ask any questions about that. And JJ is either doing some type of therapy or with a nanny or in a school that will help him. So if I didn\u2019t see him, I wasn\u2019t asking, \u2018Where is he?\u2019 I just have always trusted her. I had known that they left to Idaho because they were being threatened by people. I didn\u2019t want to ask so many questions and I didn\u2019t know what to do with that.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Melani suggested that Lori was trying to protect the children from Kay Woodcock, Charles Vallow\u2019s sister and JJ\u2019s biological grandmother. Melani claimed hat after she moved to same apartment complex where Lori was living in early November, she didn\u2019t see much of Lori at all, so it didn\u2019t concern her that she didn\u2019t see the children. Instead, she said her uncle Alex visited her almost daily, and she was consumed with a custody battle between her and her ex-husband. Shortly after moving to Rexburg, Melani met her current husband Ian, who she married after only two weeks of dating.\n\n\u201cSo if I saw Lori, she was still moving in and getting situated so I didn\u2019t spend a lot of time over there. I did see some of their things and she had a room set up perfectly for Tylee and JJ and it didn\u2019t seem strange to me,\u201d Melani said in the interview.\n\n\u201cI knew the threats she was getting from Kay Woodcock and from others and I guess I didn\u2019t ask questions because I knew that history. I knew what was going on and in my own head I\u2019m trying to find out where my own kids are.\u201d\n\nWatch the interview on EastIdahoNews.com.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n\u2018Tylee and JJ needed to die\u2019: \u2018Cult Mom\u2019 Lori Vallow believed her children were zombies, relative says [Report]\n\n\u2018Red flag\u2019 missed?
