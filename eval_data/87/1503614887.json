It can accommodate 100,000 practitioners at one go, making it the largest closed structure meditation centre in the world. When lit up at night, it can match popular structures like the Sydney harbour, the institute claimed.\n\n75-year milestone\n\nThree, three-day sessions will be held during January 28-30, February 2-4 and February 7-9, 2020, will host 1.2 lakh practitioners as part of mass meditation activity to commemorate the milestone of 75 years.
