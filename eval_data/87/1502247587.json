President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claims that international parties have accepted Petro payments in the past \u2013 despite American assertions that any companies or nations found to be dealing in Petros will face punitive measures.\n\nRegardless, Maduro has stated on several occasions that he remains in talks with international counterparts about accepting the Petro in payments deals. Moscow has previously discounted the possibility of dealing in the Petro, but Maduro is thought to be optimistic about changing Vladimir Putin\u2019s mind on the matter.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s other major ally, Iran, could also be targeted as another potential Petro collaborator should Havana decide in favor of using the oil-backed cryptocurrency.\n\nAn American think-tank last year warned that America\u2019s opponents (including Iran, Venezuela and Russia) are drawing up long-term strategies involving digital currencies, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins in an effort to bypass United States sanctions.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Mining", "Community", "Petro", "Venezuela", "Privacy", "Forecast", "CBDC", "South Korea", "Bitcoin", "Japan", "USA", "Russia", "Binance", "Legal", "MARKETS", "Security", "Payments", "Investing", "Market", "Regulation", "Altcoins", "Crime", "Exchange", "Binance Coin", "Adoption", "Economics", "Ripple", "Banking", "Society", "Central Bank", "Litecoin", "Hack", "Cuba", "M&A", "Ethereum", "Humor", "Stablecoin", "Decentralization", "Coinbase", "Trading", "Cryptocurrency", "Bitcoin Cash", "Investment", "Blockchain", "Wallet", "DeFi", "China", "ChainLink", "Tax", "ICO", "CRYPTO", "XRP", "Cardano"], "authors": ["Tim Alper"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Venezuela is in talks with Cuba about using the Petro, the former\u2019s state-issued, oil-backed cryptocurrency, in bilateral payments including trade deals.
