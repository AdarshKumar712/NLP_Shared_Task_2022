Here are some things you need to know:\n\nHealth officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are legally obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, beginning March 26, in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Some provinces and territories have also implemented additional recommendations or enforcement measures to ensure those returning to the area self-isolate.\n\nSymptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing \u2014 very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.\n\nTo prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.\n\nFor full COVID-19 coverage from Global News, click here.\n\nStory continues below advertisement", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Coronavirus", "coronavirus animals", "Coronavirus Good News", "coronavirus news", "coronavirus UK", "coronavirus update", "COVID-19", "Goat", "Goats", "Kashmiri Goats", "Llandudno", "wild goats", "News", "Trending"], "tags": ["coronavirus news", "coronavirus update", "Coronavirus Good News", "goats", "Questions answered", "COVID-19", "More Headlines", "coronavirus", "Goat", "coronavirus animals", "coronavirus UK", "Coronavirus", "click here", "wild goats", "Goats", "Llandudno", "Kashmiri Goats"], "authors": ["Josh K.
