The Hadid sisters and Kendall Jenner are Selman fans, and RiRi \u2013 who gives seriously good sunglasses \u2013 has worn her friend\u2019s shades despite designing pairs herself over at Fenty.com. So, does Selman have the same magic touch when it comes to underwear?\n\n\u201cLingerie is something I\u2019ve always wanted to design,\u201d Selman tells Vogue. \u201cSo many of my collections have been influenced and inspired by the detailing and fabrics. It was an easy pairing because Rihanna and I share so many core beliefs: our brands make people feel confident, powerful and joyful.\u201d\n\nRead more: Rihanna Names Normani Savage X Fenty\u2019s First Ambassador As Victoria\u2019s Secret Cancels Show\n\nThe Xclusive 19-piece underwear edit is split into two categories: Locket Down and Down The Aisle. The former is a play on words, but is as literal as it gets, according to the collection notes. Available in a metallic Goji Berry Red and Black Caviar, the vinyl foil spandex sets feature heart-shaped locket and key charm zipper pulls and rose gold hardware for the \u201cbad ass babe\u201d.\n\nRead more: Rihanna\u2019s First Fenty Collaboration Is All About Big Boss Energy\n\nDown the Aisle, in contrast, is \u201cdeceivingly sweet\u201d, all delicate ruffles and heart trims. Designed to be layered, mixed and matched, the separates have a vintage look, as well as that girl next door aesthetic.\n\nEach set is packaged neatly into a Savage X Fenty Xtra VIP box with a bonus collectors\u2019 Rihanna phone ring. But it will be the campaign faces that sway you to click to buy, rather than the gift.
