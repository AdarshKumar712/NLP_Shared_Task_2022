"PABLO Sanchez\u2019s first bid to be installed as Spain\u2019s prime minister has failed in a highly-charged investiture debate.\n\nFollowing Sanchez\u2019s successful election win in November last year, Spain\u2019s caretaker PM still needed a 176-majority in the 350-strong congress.\n\nIn the end, 166 deputies voted in favor (PSOE, Unidas Podemos, Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds, Comprom\u00eds, Nueva Canarias, Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG) and Teruel Existe), 165 against (Popular Party (PP), Vox, Ciudadanos, Together for Catalonia, Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), Navarra Suma, Coalici\u00f3n Canaria, Foro Asturias and the Regionalist Party of Catalonia (PRC)), with 18 abstentions (ERC and EH Bildu).\n\nAt a second vote on Tuesday, however, he is expected to win the poll, given that a simple majority of more yes votes than no is required.\n\nSanchez\u2019s chances have been bolstered by the abstention of the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) thanks to a deal covering the future approach by the central government to the issue of Catalan independence.\n\nThe future coalition government will expect fierce opposition from other parties in Congress due to this approach, however.\n\nThe leader of the conservative Popular Party (PP), Pablo Casado, yesterday accused S\u00e1nchez of destroying national sovereignty thanks to his agreement with the ERC.\n\nNever before had the \u2018defence of the homeland\u2019 been such a topic of debate in Congress \u2013 an issue also taken up by far-right Vox and center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens).\n\nThe debate was thrown into turmoil this morning when speaker for the Baque EH Bildu party faced chants of \u2018murderers\u2019 and \u2018long live the King\u2019 from Vox, PP and Ciudadanos.\n\nS\u00e1nchez, however, insisted that the predictions of these right-wing parties would not come to pass. \u201cSpain is not going to break up and the Constitution will not be violated,\u201d he told the assembled deputies. \u201cWhat is going to be broken is the blocking of the progressive government that was voted for democratically by Spaniards.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["news
