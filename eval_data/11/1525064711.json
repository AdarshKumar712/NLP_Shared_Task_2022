It is because for too long in our history, for too many years, we failed to do so. Therefore, finding a solution will not be simple.\u201d\n\nDuring the debate, Miller said Bennett spoke with hereditary chiefs Tuesday.\n\nThe situation is evolving hour by hour, he said, describing the de-escalation efforts as positive.\n\n\u201cClearly we see there is a path forward, we see there is modest and positive progress,\u201d he said.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 19, 2020.\n\nAmy Smart, The Canadian Press", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Feb 19 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.news957.com/wp-content/themes/news957/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hereditary chiefs say they'll meet with ministers if RCMP get out", "description": "VANCOUVER \u2014 A small, mobile RCMP detachment in\u00a0a remote area of\u00a0British Columbia has become a bargaining chip in proposed talks that many hope could put an end to blockades that have disrupted rail and road traffic across the country.
