On the basis of the past two weeks I don\u2019t know what Level 3 is but am pretty sure that resembles the game \u2018Statues\u2019 from my 70s childhood. You have to stand frozen on the spot until the State of Emergency is lifted. Otherwise the forces of law and order have the power to fine/detain/blast you with water canon/all of the previous.\n\nWith the country in lockdown I counted my blessings for a number of reasons. Firstly because of the beautiful house that I live in, surrounded by land and overlooking a lake. Even the friendly Policia Locales from the village (there are four and you don\u2019t dial an emergency number, you dial their mobile) agreed that if you had to sit out the lockdown, the Casita was a rather splendid place to be.\n\nAs someone who spends most of their time pottering around, reading trivia, talking to myself, playing obscure music and staring vacantly into the middle distance \u2013 and that\u2019s just on air at the radio station \u2013 the lockdown hasn\u2019t really made that much difference to me. The meltdown reaction to many people on social media raised a wry smile but for bookworms, gamers, model makers and the like, the lockdown has been geek heaven. On a purely selfish note, on the occasions that I have had to sally forth from the Casita, the road has been blissfully free from cyclists, which, as you know by now, are the bane of my life.\n\nI was thinking that this whole coronavirus malarkey was something of a walk in the park that wouldn\u2019t really affect me. And then one of my best friends posted a shocking photograph that his wife had taken. Diagnosed with COVID-19, he experienced chest pains and paramedics rushed to his house at 5am. He told me later that it felt like he had been \u201chit by the house\u201d. I\u2019m both pleased and relieved to report that he is on the road to recovery. But please, wash your hands, self isolate and stay in the f***king house!\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["news spain", "The Olive Press", "newspaper"], "authors": ["Https", "Www.Theolivepress.Es Spain-News Author Giles", "Do You Have News For Us At Spain S Most Popular English Newspaper - The Olive Press", "Contact Us Now Via Email"], "publish_date": "Sun Mar 29 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "And thus it came to pass that the Geek did, indeed, inherit the Earth", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.theolivepress.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/opfavicon-1.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.theolivepress.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Giles-column.jpeg", "secure_url": "https://www.theolivepress.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Giles-column.jpeg", "width": 720, "height": 960}, "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "How Spain's coronavirus is both a geek heaven and a harsh reality writes Giles Brown - Olive Press News Spain", "description": "And thus it came to pass that the Geek did, indeed, inherit the Earth", "url": "https://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2020/03/29/how-spains-coronavirus-is-both-a-geek-heaven-and-a-harsh-reality-writes-giles-brown/", "site_name": "Olive Press News Spain", "updated_time": "2020-03-27T16:03:52+00:00"}, "description": "And thus it came to pass that the Geek did, indeed, inherit the Earth", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/OlivePressNewspaper/", "tag": "The Olive Press", "section": "Columnists", "published_time": "2020-03-29T07:00:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-27T16:03:52+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "And thus it came to pass that the Geek did, indeed, inherit the Earth", "title": "How Spain's coronavirus is both a geek heaven and a harsh reality writes Giles Brown - Olive Press News Spain", "site": "@olivepress", "image": "https://www.theolivepress.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Giles-column.jpeg", "creator": "@olivepress"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "fb": {"pages": 113448108715799}, "google-site-verification": "Mf0jYCrXkyoVaT3YfRt26elD5Omkn7vLDiBeZClA5wY"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2020/03/29/how-spains-coronavirus-is-both-a-geek-heaven-and-a-harsh-reality-writes-giles-brown/"}
