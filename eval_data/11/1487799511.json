Pressured to provide a public explanation on her absence, Vidal released a statement through her social media accounts to reveal her serious health diagnosis. It read:\n\n\u201cToday I did not go to vote in Congress, and it will take me some time to return. I have cancer. A rare, widespread and aggressive one.\u201d\n\nAvui no he pogut anar a al Congr\u00e9s a votar. S\u00f3n dies de nervis i jo i la meva fam\u00edlia hem cregut important explicar el perqu\u00e8.\n\nSalut i lluita \u270a\ud83c\udffb pic.twitter.com/9oQqOw8O6c \u2014 Aina Vidal S\u00e1ez (@AinaVS) January 5, 2020\n\n\n\nThe news has somewhat overshadowed the heightened political crisis, with an outpouring of support being made to the popular Deputy of En Com\u00fa Podem. Hundreds of Spaniards wished Vidal the very best, with one simply stating that \u201cWho cares about the vote, this news shows what really matters in life, which is more than Spain\u2019s government.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the anguish, Sanchez must continue on with his efforts to gain victory, where he now has less than two days to secure support to end a lengthy eight-month political gridlock. On Sunday, he had needed an absolute majority of at least 176 votes out of 350-member chamber to be confirmed as Prime Minister \u2013 an attempt he failed, garnering 166 in favour, 165 against and 18 abstentions.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 8, Sanchez will have a second chance of success, where he will now only need more votes in favour of his reelection than ones given against it. The political crisis is also drawing the international media\u2019s attention due to Spain being without a proper government after two inconclusive elections took place in April and November.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Spain news", "News", "Spain's political crisis deepens for Pedro S\u00e1nchez as Deputy reveals cancer diagnosis"], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": "Mon Jan  6 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "AS all eyes are fixed upon Spain\u2019s government and mounting pressure is pinned upon acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to take a majority, a leading", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/identicon-1-150x150.gif?x27390", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "AS all eyes are fixed upon Spain\u2019s government and mounting pressure is pinned upon acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to take a majority, a leading", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Spain's political crisis deepens for Pedro S\u00e1nchez as Deputy reveals cancer diagnosis", "description": "AS all eyes are fixed upon Spain\u2019s government and mounting pressure is pinned upon acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to take a majority, a leading", "url": "https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2020/01/06/spains-political-crisis-deepens-for-pedro-sanchez-as-deputy-reveals-cancer-diagnosis/", "site_name": "Euro Weekly News Spain", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5477708-1.jpg?x27390", "width": 800, "height": 450}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/EuroWeeklyNews", "published_time": "2020-01-06T09:50:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-06T15:36:01+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 181067459001980}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@euroweeklynews", "site": "@euroweeklynews"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 1.0.62.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/identicon-1.gif?x27390", "theme-color": "#d33"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2020/01/06/spains-political-crisis-deepens-for-pedro-sanchez-as-deputy-reveals-cancer-diagnosis/"}
