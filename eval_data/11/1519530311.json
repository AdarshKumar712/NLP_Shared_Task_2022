The other 20 per cent is what we are talking about\u2026 which is insured. We are redirecting [the fruit] and I believe that at the end of February we will have a slightly more concrete picture,\u201d he said.\n\nO\u2019Ryan added that logistics companies had expressed concerns that the crisis could lead to a backlog of containers being discharged and returned.\n\nThe situation is not as acute for Peru, as the table grape campaign \u2013 the number one fruit exported to China \u2013 has just concluded and most of the production was sold prior to Chinese New Year.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate that all the northern production managed to be delivered and distributed. However, there is still a remnant of production from the south and we are watching to see what happens, because we have part of that merchandise in Chinese ports, \u201d Leonel Arce, general manager of the Agroindustrial Beta Complex told Fresh News.\n\nLuis Vila of the Chamber of Commerce of Ica, said local producers were concerned that future shipments of citrus, asparagus, avocados, pomegranates and quinoa could be affected.\n\nPeru exported US$262m of fresh produce to China in 2019, including US$124m of grapes, US$87m of blueberries and US$34m of avocados.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["China Fruit Logistica", "Global Berry Congress", "The Importer", "Food Safety & Certification", "Packaging & Technology", "Foodservice", "Wholesale", "Video", "Convenience", "Education", "Fruitnet Insights", "Local Sourcing", "Global Tomato Congress", "News Analysis", "Environment", "Energy", "Marketing", "Production & Trade", "Fruit Logistica", "Organics", "People", "Exotics", "Consumers", "Crime", "Comment & Analysis", "Interviews", "Podcasts", "Features", "Food waste", "Data", "Sustainable Business", "Cartoon", "Coronavirus", "Discounters", "Audio", "Recruitment & Training", "Videos", "Sustainability", "Events", "Bushel Box", "Week in pictures", "Research & Development", "Money", "Health", "Asia Fruit Logistica", "Fruitbox", "Mergers & Acquisitions", "Retail & Distribution", "Fresh Focus Chile", "Brexit", "Climate change", "Charity", "Eurofruit 500", "European Vegetable Strategies", "Transport & Logistics", "Economics & Finance", "Government", "Fairtrade & CSR"], "authors": ["Maura Maxwell"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Chinese outbreak is taking its toll on fruit exports from the region", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "http://www.fruitnet.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@eurofruit", "title": "Latin America fears fallout of coronavirus", "description": "The Chinese outbreak is taking its toll on fruit exports from the region", "image": {"identifier": "http://upload.evocdn.co.uk/fruitnet/uploads/asset_image/2_1212900_e.jpg", "alt": "Latin America fears fallout of coronavirus"}, "creator": "Maura Maxwell"}, "description": "The Chinese outbreak is taking its toll on fruit exports from the region", "robots": "index,follow", "google-site-verification": "inGH5rbiw9PvAULKUBRoYEiy9FAOr_Kkx5DNvt-b94k", "og": {"image": "http://upload.evocdn.co.uk/fruitnet/uploads/asset_image/2_1212900_e.jpg", "url": "http://www.fruitnet.com/eurofruit/article/180871/latin-america-fears-fallout-of-coronavirus", "title": "Latin America fears fallout of coronavirus", "description": "The Chinese outbreak is taking its toll on fruit exports from the region"}, "generator": "Evosite Core 2.24.06"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.fruitnet.com/eurofruit/article/180871/latin-america-fears-fallout-of-coronavirus"}
