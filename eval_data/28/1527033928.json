videoPresident Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo\n\nThe President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, says investor confidence in Ghana\u2019s economy is growing following the competent management of the economy exhibited since 2017.\n\nAccording to President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, \u201cin three years we have reduced inflation to its lowest level (7.8% in January 2020) since 1992. For the first time in over forty (40) years, we have had a fiscal deficit below five per cent (5%) of GDP for three years in a row.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, indicated that \u201cfor the first time in over twenty (20) years, the balance of trade (that is the difference between our exports and imports) has been in surplus for three (3) consecutive years. Our current account deficit is shrinking, interest rates are declining, and the average annual rate of depreciation of the cedi is at its lowest for any first-term government in the Fourth Republic.\u201d\n\nHe made this known on Thursday, 20th February, 2020, when he delivered a Message on the State of the Nation, in Parliament.\n\nEconomic growth, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo said, has rebounded to place Ghana among the fastest growing economies in the world for three years in a row at an annual average of 7%, up from 3.4% in 2016, the lowest in nearly three decades.\n\n\u201cThe international investor community has recognised this development, resulting in Ghana, today, being the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in West Africa. The sovereign credit rating agencies have upgraded our ratings, and also improved the outlook for this year, notwithstanding the fact that it is an election year,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo added, \u201cThis is a massive vote of confidence in the current management of the economy, as best illustrated by Ghana\u2019s successful issue of the longest-dated Eurobond ever issued by a sub-Saharan African country, with investors placing fifteen billion United States dollars ($15 billion) of orders for Ghana\u2019s forty-one (41) year Eurobond.\u201d\n\nThe seven (7) year Bond, he explained, attracted the lowest coupon rates ever for Ghana at 6.375%, compared with the 9.25% Ghana had to pay for a similar Eurobond issue in 2016.\n\n\u201cNo wonder Bloomberg, the reputable global financial media house, earlier this week, highlighted Ghana as the top candidate for an economic leap in Africa. This expression of confidence is important because it will lead to enhanced investments in our economy, and the accompanying greater numbers of jobs,\u201d he added.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Feb 21 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.ghanamma.com/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.ghanamma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/45531064.jpg"}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "General News of Friday, 21 February 2020 Source: presidency.gov.gh 2020-02-21 play videoPresident Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo The President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, says investor confidence in Ghana\u2019s economy is growing following the competent management of the economy exhibited since 2017.
