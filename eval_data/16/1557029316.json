"movies": [], "text": "NEW DELHI: The restrictions imposed by the army on its personnel and formations in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak is posing challenges to its internal functioning.Extension of leave for soldiers and placing those who recently returned on quarantine have created a shortage of manpower that is affecting the turnover of troops for daily, security and administrative duties. While this is also affecting the training routines of troops, reduction in attendance at the headquarters is set to slow down other work as well, said officials.The steps are aimed at ensuring social distancing and preventing contagion. It has created an unprecedented situation, forcing the army to improvise, especially because troops eat, sleep and train together within confined spaces. For example, one particular unit has now divided troops into teams that live in different areas, while ensuring that only one team uses the common toilets at a time. Training is conducted in small batches, and the equipment is sanitised every time it is used.The army on Monday issued fresh instructions to all its military stations, cantonments, units and formations in the 82 districts under lockdown. These include restricted movements, functioning of only those personnel engaged in essential services and the closure of all CSD canteens Officials said the reduction in manpower in some of the army\u2019s formations was due to the extension of leave of soldiers till April 15 and placing those who recently returned on quarantine. Those who are going on leave due to an emergency in their families will be sent for a minimum period of 30 days. \u201cWe are in a situation where we are slightly less in strength. It affects day-to-day functioning, administrative and security duties. There is an increase in the workload of those on guard duties, because there is less turnover of troops,\u201d an official said.The manpower also gets affected because troops are tasked with manning the quarantine facilities setup by the army. However, officials said the situation was not \u201calarming\u201d, would not affect operational efficiency and that it was necessary due to the pandemic.Work at the army headquarters in Delhi has also started slowing down, following the army\u2019s Friday advisory of reducing attendance in offices and starting the work from home concept. Last week, the army passed instructions that 35% officers and 50% junior commissioned officers (JCO) and other ranks (OR) would work from home for a week from Monday, while the next group would do this starting March 30. The lockdown in Delhi is also affecting the travel of those personnel who stay in Gurgaon and Uttar Pradesh.\u201cWork at the headquarters has slowed, as we are working with bare essentials. The deadline for work such as submitting reports will be extended. Only emergency work will continue as it was,\u201d an official said.The army\u2019s complaints section for now will only be dealing with cases that are urgent. Officials said rosters had been created to divide the staff between those who work at home and those who come to the office. However, it remains to be seen what work will be given to those working from home, because files cannot be taken home due to confidentiality issues. Several issues also cannot be communicated over email due to cybersecurity threats. Moreover, JCOs and ORs are mainly clerks who are part of the filing system for letters and documents, which can be done only from the offices.Officials said training of troops had also reduced. However, this will not affect operational preparedness, because it is for a short duration and can be made up later.In relation to the unit mentioned earlier, training of troops has become more \u201cconcentrated\u201d, because smaller batches are being trained. \u201cThis has given us an opportunity to train better. Training small groups ensures that everyone\u2019s doubts are cleared and attention is given to each aspect. But due to the pandemic, we have to sanitise an equipment every time it is used,\u201d an official said.This type of training comes after troops were divided into small teams that maintained a distance of 200 metre between each other. It is also being ensured that distances are being maintained between troops of a team. \u201cOnly one team can use a bathroom at a time. After the team is done, the bathroom is sanitised and only then can the other team use it. We also have separate timings for eating at the cookhouse for the teams,\u201d the official said.A major concern for the army stations and cantonments, which are isolated areas in a city, is the civilian manpower that is coming from outside. For example, washing points and blow drying of clothes have been setup outside the gates of one of the cantonments for this manpower.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Army", "CSD canteens", "Coronavirus outbreak", "formations", "coronavirus"], "tags": ["Coronavirus outbreak", "CSD canteens", "coronavirus outbreak", "formations", "army", "Army"], "authors": ["Shaurya Karanbir Gurung"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Extension of leave for soldiers and placing those who recently returned on quarantine have created a shortage of manpower that is affecting the turnover of troops for daily, security and administrative duties.
