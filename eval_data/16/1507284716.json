It\u2019s very good for them. In fact it\u2019s overly good to them. So we\u2019ll see what happens. Now without them, we don\u2019t do the deal and that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nTrump added, \u201cWe think there\u2019s a very good chance that they\u2019re going to want this.\u201d\n\nAfter his session with Netanyahu, Trump met separately with Benny Gantz, the head of Israel\u2019s centrist Blue and White Party, who is the right-wing prime minister\u2019s rival in a March 2 election.\n\nWhile Trump allowed reporters and cameras in for his meeting with Netanyahu, the session with Gantz was held without the presence of the news media.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s peace plan is a significant and historic milestone indeed,\u201d Gantz told reporters later. \u201cImmediately after the elections, I will work toward implementing it from within a stable, functioning Israeli government, in tandem with the other countries in our region.\u201d\n\nPalestinian leaders say they were not invited to Washington for Trump\u2019s presentation of his long secret peace blueprint and that no plan could work without them.\n\n\u201cWe reject it, and we demand the international community not be a partner to it because it contradicts the basics of international law and inalienable Palestinian rights,\u201d Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said on Jan. 27. \u201cIt is nothing but a plan to finish off the Palestinian cause.\u201d\n\nPalestinians have refused to deal with the Trump administration in protest at such pro-Israeli policies as moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, whose eastern half Palestinians seek for a future capital.\n\nTrump\u2019s two days of meetings with the Israelis stand in contrast to a trial in the Republican-led Senate weighing articles of impeachment submitted by the Democratic-led House of Representatives against the Republican president.\n\nBut whether it truly will jumpstart the long-stalled effort to bring Israelis and Palestinians together is far from certain.\n\nPalestinians denounced a $50 billion economic revival plan the Trump administration set forth last July to lift the Palestinian and neighboring Arab state economies because the proposal did nothing to address Israeli occupation.\n\nThe White House hope was that support from both Netanyahu and Gantz would provide momentum.\n\nHaving both Israeli leaders present removes the domestic Israeli political tensions, said a U.S. source familiar with internal deliberations.\n\nThe Trump plan is the product of three years\u2019 effort by senior advisers Jared Kushner and Avi Berkowitz, as well as Jason Greenblatt, who left the government last autumn.\n\nThe proposal, which officials say will be more than 50 pages long, aims to take on some of the most difficult issues separating the two sides, such as the status of Jerusalem.\n\nBut Palestinians called Trump\u2019s proposal dead in the water even before its publication.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said Washington can no longer be regarded as an honest mediator. In addition to the actions he took on Jerusalem, Trump slashed hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to the Palestinians.\n\nPalestinian and Arab sources who were briefed on the draft fear it seeks to bribe Palestinians into accepting Israeli occupation, in what could be a prelude to Israel annexing about half of the West Bank including most of the Jordan Valley, the strategic and fertile easternmost strip of the territory.\n\nFurther obstacles to a peace deal include the expansion of Israeli settlements on occupied land and the rise to power in Gaza of the Islamist movement Hamas, which is formally committed to Israel\u2019s destruction.\n\nThe Trump administration in November reversed decades of U.S. policy when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that Washington no longer regarded Israeli settlements on West Bank land as inconsistent with international law.\n\nPalestinians and most of the international community view the settlements as illegal. Israel disputes this.\n\nNetanyahu, a veteran right-wing leader, faces political and legal troubles at home as he heads for his third election in less than a year, and was indicted on criminal charges in November. He denies any wrongdoing.\n\nJon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said both Trump and Netanyahu were looking to change the subject from their own domestic troubles.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity to change the subject and to demonstrate that there are important things that need to be done. The problem is it doesn\u2019t feel like this is the beginning of an important initiative,\u201d he said.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s principal domestic political rival, Gantz, a centrist former general, last week lifted his objection to having the peace plan published before Israel\u2019s March election. He had previously seen it as interference in the vote.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Israel", "Palestine", "Donald Trump"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "US President Donald Trump said he will announce his long-delayed Middle East peace proposal and that he believes Palestinians will eventually go along with it despite their refusal to engage on the subject.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//s.hurriyet.com.tr/hdnstatic/dist/images/hdn.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "US President Donald Trump said he will announce his long-delayed Middle East peace proposal and that he believes Palestinians will eventually go along with it despite their refusal to engage on the subject.", "keywords": "Israel,Palestine,Donald Trump", "news_keywords": "Israel,Palestine,Donald Trump", "og": {"title": "Trump to share Mideast peace plan with Israelis - World News", "description": "US President Donald Trump said he will announce his long-delayed Middle East peace proposal and that he believes Palestinians will eventually go along with it despite their refusal to engage on the subject.", "image": "https://i.hurimg.com/i/hdn/75/200x200/5e2fdfbd7af507082474dc54.jpg", "site_name": "H\u00fcrriyet Daily News", "url": "https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/trump-to-share-mideast-peace-plan-with-israelis-151483", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@HDNER", "url": "https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/trump-to-share-mideast-peace-plan-with-israelis-151483", "title": "Trump to share Mideast peace plan with Israelis - World News", "description": "US President Donald Trump said he will announce his long-delayed Middle East peace proposal and that he believes Palestinians will eventually go along with it despite their refusal to engage on the subject.", "image": {"src": "https://i.hurimg.com/i/hdn/75/200x200/5e2fdfbd7af507082474dc54.jpg"}, "account_id": 87645208}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/trump-to-share-mideast-peace-plan-with-israelis-151483"}
