The organisation team of the Munich demonstration has also been thinking about this for days.\n\nDue to today's discussion in the core group regarding the announcement by Health Minister Spahn, we decided to postpone the demo until early autumn. This is for the following reasons:\n\nWe are not concerned with the fear of the corona virus (this fear is not present), but we are concerned about the official measures against the foreign speakers, but of course also against those who participate in the demo. There is a risk of quarantine as an official deprivation of lfreedom with massive consequences if only one person is tested positive. Or we could be blamed if new cases of corona infection arise in Bavaria afterwards.\n\nThe press is not on our side, which is why there is a real risk that when the demo takes place, the participants would be described as irresponsible, ruthless and so on, which would do more harm to our movement than postponing the demo to next autumn.\n\nSome foreign speakers are already unable to travel to Germany. Also from the United States some people are reconsidering their participation.\n\nFlights can probably still be rebooked free of charge and other reservations can also be canceled, which brings great financial relief, since the same costs will not arise again. However, this is not possible only a few days before the demo. Here you have to act relatively quickly.\n\nThe authorities can still ban the demo one day before March 21, which is very likely to occur based on current developments. If this happens, the damage would be many times greater.\n\nFor many, this decision is of course a big disappointment. This decision was not an easy one for us to take either, and many hours went into \"for and against discussions\". This decision is a rational one and not one from the heart. But reason is now more appropriate given the hysteria among the general public.\n\nWe will be happy to inform you as soon as possible when the new date is fixed. Of course this still has to be discussed with the city of Munich and our foreign guests.\n\nAt this point we would like to thank EVERYONE for the commitment of so many volunteers. However, we are sure that we can approach the demo in autumn much more calmly and relaxed, with even more energy and enthusiasm. Thank you already today that we will be able to count on all of you again.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe organization team from Netzwerk Impfentscheid Germany\n\nDaniel Trappitsch, board member Netzwerk Impfentscheid", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Super User"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Invitation to european protest for medical freedom.
