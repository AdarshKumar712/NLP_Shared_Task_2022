It is a significant moment for the company that was founded only in 2003. CEO Elon Musk made the announcement by sharing a picture of the car \u2014 a red Model Y \u2014 on Twitter. The firm released its first consumer car, the Roadster, back in 2008, meaning it\u2019s taken a little over 12 years to hit this million-car milestone.\n\nIn its January earnings report, the company said it hopes to ship over 5,00,000 cars worldwide in 2020. Established automakers like Toyota or the Volkswagen Group each produce over ten million vehicles every year. Nevertheless, Tesla\u2019s milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for an auto start-up that only produces electric vehicles and is indicative of how Musk says he works \u2014 building companies to solve problems based on their importance, not on his likelihood of success.\n\nFurthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original \u201cfall 2020\u201d estimate. The Model Y will be Tesla\u2019s fourth electric car line, following the Model S, Model X, and the cheaper Model 3, which made up most of its production and deliveries in Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report.\n\nThe company said it produced 17,933 Model S and X vehicles in the quarter and delivered 19,450. It produced 86,958 Model 3 vehicles and delivered 92,550. It delivered 367,500 vehicles for the full year. It\u2019s also developing new facilities in Berlin to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, which should start rolling out in 2021. Tesla says its Model 3 and Model Y production capacity in Fremont is 4,00,000 units per year, while its Shanghai factory can produce 1,50,000 Model 3 cars per year. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck is due to go into production in late 2021.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["India Matters"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Mar 13 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original \u201cfall 2020\u201d estimate.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://images.newindianexpress.com/images/FrontEnd/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Tesla just made its one millionth car", "description": "Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original \u201cfall 2020\u201d estimate.", "msvalidate.01": "E3846DEF0DE4D18E294A6521B2CEBBD2", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"pages": 178988994793}, "og": {"url": "https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2020/mar/13/tesla-just-made-its-one-millionth-car-2116121.html", "type": "article", "title": "Tesla just made its one millionth car", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/3/13/w600X390/SDGI0JFGI9UJ.jpg", "width": 450, "height": 298}, "site_name": "The New Indian Express", "description": "Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original \u201cfall 2020\u201d estimate."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "NewIndianXpress", "site": "@newindianexpress.com", "title": "Tesla just made its one millionth car", "description": "Furthermore, the EV maker is also expected to start shipping its latest car, the Model Y, months ahead of its original \u201cfall 2020\u201d estimate.", "image": "https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/3/13/w600X390/SDGI0JFGI9UJ.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2020/mar/13/tesla-just-made-its-one-millionth-car-2116121.html"}
