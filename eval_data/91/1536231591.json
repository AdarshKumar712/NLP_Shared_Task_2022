This new route, which is already on sale, will be operated by one of the airline\u2019s new Airbus A350 aircraft.\n\nJust this week Aeroflot\u2019s first Airbus A350 took its first leap into the sky from Toulouse, France. The airline has been busy announcing routes for the aircraft, from London and New York to Beijing. However, now we have another route to add to the portfolio. From the 25th of October 2020, the world\u2019s most punctual airline will begin flying to Singapore. This new route will be operated by the A350.\n\nWhat to expect?\n\nAeroflot will operate its new Singapore service five times per week. Flights will depart Moscow on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. Meanwhile, the return legs from Singapore will depart on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.\n\nThe flight schedule should look something like this:\n\nAeroflot flight SU 280 will depart from Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO) at 19:40 on the days that the flight is operating. Following a 10-hour 15-minute flight, the aircraft will touch down in Singapore (SIN) the next day at 10:55.\n\nFollowing around an hour and a half on the ground, Aeroflot flight SU 281 will depart from Singapore at 12:30. The Airbus A350-900 will fly for 11-hours before arriving back in Moscow at 18:30.\n\nThe new route to Singapore will be a key part of Aeroflot\u2019s strategy. The Russian flag carrier wants to turn Moscow into a transit hub. This would see it focusing on routes from Asia to Europe and North America. Aeroflot believes that by offering fast transfers in Moscow it can cut three hours off of the time competitors take for similar routes.\n\nThe Aeroflot A350\n\nAeroflot\u2019s first Airbus A350 is on course to be delivered this quarter having taken its first flight earlier this week. The aircraft will be delivered to the Russian flag carrier sporting an elegant white paint scheme, a departure from the carrier\u2019s signature silver style.\n\nThe airline will operate the aircraft with three classes of travel. These are business class, Comfort Class (Aeroflot\u2019s premium economy cabin), alongside an economy cabin.\n\nCommenting, Aeroflot\u2019s Deputy CEO for commerce and finance, Andrey Chikhanchin, said \u201cAeroflot is constantly expanding its international route network, continually providing new unique opportunities for passengers.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe addition of the modern and fuel-efficient long haul a three50\u2013900 to the Aeroflot fleet allows the airline to further strengthen its competitive advantages, among which are high-quality service and superior value for money.\u201d\n\nAre you looking forward to flying on the Aeroflot Airbus A350?
