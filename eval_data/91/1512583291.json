Security Council that the militant group \u2014 known as IS and ISIL \u2014 is also exploiting weaknesses in security in both countries.\n\nThe experts monitoring sanctions against the Islamic State and al-Qaida said it is unclear whether the Islamic States\u2019 new leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi Al-Qurayshi, can effectively lead the extremist group\u2019s diverse and far-flung supporters and affiliates.\n\nBut the panel said unidentified U.N. member nations have made a provisional assessment that the strategic direction of the extremist group is unchanged when it comes to administration, propaganda and recruitment \u2014 and that command and control between its \u201ccore in the conflict zone and affiliates abroad will be maintained.\u201d\n\nAl-Qurayshi\u2019s predecessor, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed in a U.S. raid last October in Syria\u2019s last rebel stronghold in Idlib province.\n\nThe experts said the issue of foreigners who came to fight for the Islamic State and were part of its so-called \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria and Iraq \u201cremains acute.\u201d\n\nMember states assess that between one-half and two-thirds of the more than 40,000 who joined the \u201ccaliphate\u201d are still alive, they said in the report circulated Friday.\n\nThe panel said the reduction in U.S. forces in Syria has raised concerns about the ability of security forces in the country\u2019s northeast \u201cto maintain adequate control over a restive population of detained ISIL fighters, as well as family members, numbering more than 100,000.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany dependents remain equally ideologically committed and their fate is a major concern for the international community,\u201d the experts said. \u201cSome 2,000 foreign terrorist fighters remain in detention in the area.\u201d\n\nWhile some countries believe the best way to address the issue is to repatriate Islamic State members, others are reluctant to accept returnees, the panel said, and the issue \u201cis expected to aggravate the global threat posed by ISIL, and possibly al-Qaida for years to come.\u201d\n\nThe experts said Idlib province, the last rebel stronghold where Syrian forces launched an offensive in December, remains dominated by groups affiliated with al-Qaida but also hosts relocated IS fighters and their families.\n\nParts of Iraq, especially areas in Anbar province near the Syrian border, \u201calso represent a permissive security environment for the movement of ISIL fighters,\u201d the panel said.\n\nBeyond Syria and Iraq, the experts said U.N. member nations are most concerned about the conflict in Afghanistan, which by some measures suffers \u201cthe heaviest toll from terrorism of any country in the world.\u201d\n\nAl-Qaida and foreign fighters aligned with it, under protection of the Taliban, \u201cpose a long-term global threat,\u201d the panel said.\n\nIslamic State extremists suffered sever losses and were largely expelled from their Afghan stronghold in Nangarhar province in November 2019, but the panel said IS \u201chas proved resilient in the past and is still assessed to pose a serious threat.\u201d\n\nThe experts said threats from al-Qaida and Islamic State affiliates also persist in parts of Africa and southeast Asia.\n\nThey called the Islamic State West Africa Province in the Lake Chad Basin the extremist group\u2019s most successful affiliate in the last six months of 2019 for its \u201chigh tempo of attacks\u201d and raids on security forces in Niger, which garnered significant arms, military materiel and other supplies.\n\nLoading...
