But in some cases, PPGF redirected contributions from selected charities to other organizations with similar purposes without telling donors. PPGF also failed to adequately disclose that charities that have PayPal accounts can receive donations faster than those that do not.\n\nCharity regulators nationwide joined the effort to investigate PPGF\u2019s fundraising activities, including its disclosures, vetting practices and treatment of charitable contributions. To address the states\u2019 concerns, PPGF agreed to reform its disclosures to ensure that donors know:\n\nThat they are contributing to PPGF\n\nThe timeframe in which a selected charity can receive funds from PPGF\n\nThe implication of being an enrolled charity rather than an unenrolled charity on the PPGF platform\n\nPPGF also agreed to notify donors when it redirects charitable contributions to organizations other than those they selected. PPGF will provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.\n\nAdditionally, PPGF agreed to pay $200,000 to the National Association of Attorneys General for deposit into the NAAG Charities Enforcement and Training Fund. This fund was established to defray costs associated with the investigation and litigation of cases brought by state charities regulators, and to provide training and education to those regulators.\n\nStates and territories participating in the settlement include Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina Secretary of State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.\n\nSubmitted by the office of Attorney General Dave Yost.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Community"], "authors": ["Pomeroy Daily Sentinel"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan 22 15:58:30 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "COLUMBUS \u2014 Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and charity regulators from 21 other states and the District of Columbia have reached an agreement with Pa", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://d31029zd06w0t6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2017/08/mydailysentinel-150x150.jpeg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "geo.placename": "Pomeroy", "theme-color": "#006400", "twitter": {"site": "@td_sentinel", "card": "summary", "description": "COLUMBUS \u2014 Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and charity regulators from 21 other states and the District of Columbia have reached an agreement with Pa", "title": "Multistate settlement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund - Pomeroy Daily Sentinel"}, "description": "COLUMBUS \u2014 Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and charity regulators from 21 other states and the District of Columbia have reached an agreement with Pa", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Multistate settlement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund - Pomeroy Daily Sentinel", "description": "COLUMBUS \u2014 Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and charity regulators from 21 other states and the District of Columbia have reached an agreement with Pa", "url": "https://www.mydailysentinel.com/features/community/49574/multistate-settlement-with-paypal-charitable-giving-fund", "site_name": "Pomeroy Daily Sentinel"}, "article": {"section": "Community", "published_time": "2020-01-22T15:58:30-05:00"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://d31029zd06w0t6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2017/08/mydailysentinel.jpeg"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.mydailysentinel.com/features/community/49574/multistate-settlement-with-paypal-charitable-giving-fund"}
