They will hold the games from July 23 to August 8, 2021.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of the information the IOC has, postponement has been decided,\u201d Pound said in a phone interview.\n\nThis news comes less than a day after the IOC issued a statement saying it might consider postponing the games but would not cancel them. That statement sparked moves by both the Canadian and Australian Olympic committees to withdraw from the 2020 games.\n\n\u201cWhile it is incredibly disappointing, postponement is likely the best option we have,\u201d said Sarah Laico, events and logistics extern at the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee.\n\n\u201cThe games simply would not have gone on with the same vigor and excitement they deserve, and we owe it to our athletes to keep them safe and healthy, first and foremost. I look forward to seeing Team USA shine at the right time, under the right conditions.\u201d\n\nWe will update this story with more information as it becomes available.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["coronavirus", "More Articles", "Reviews"], "authors": ["Adam Ruggiero", "March"], "publish_date": "Mon Mar 23 18:42:53 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A veteran International Olympic Committee member said, 'postponement has been decided.'", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://gearjunkie.com/wp-content/themes/marvin2/assets/images/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 1581013275506378, "pages": 20785552513}, "application-name": "GearJunkie", "theme-color": "#226440", "google-site-verification": "YMt2qhx8r9X9CWKsaIwZRfyWsnM7guvgnwSUo03Z0MU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "A veteran International Olympic Committee member said, 'postponement has been decided.'", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Olympics Postponed: Official Says 2021 Likely | GearJunkie", "description": "A veteran International Olympic Committee member said, 'postponement has been decided.'", "url": "https://gearjunkie.com/news/2020-olympics-postponed-coronavirus-tokyo", "site_name": "GearJunkie", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2020/03/portland-olympic-rings-1200x628.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheGearJunkie/", "published_time": "2020-03-23T18:42:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-30T18:25:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thegearjunkie", "site": "@thegearjunkie", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Adam Ruggiero", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "author": "Adam Ruggiero", "gj_ga_category": "News Olympics"}, "canonical_link": "https://gearjunkie.com/news/2020-olympics-postponed-coronavirus-tokyo"}
