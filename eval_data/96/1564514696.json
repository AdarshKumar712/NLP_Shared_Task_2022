And I mean even the doctor.\n\nAs part of today\u2019s presser, United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson delivered some remarks to the nation from the podium. And THIS GUY literally opened up his remarks by coughing into his hand and then TOUCHING. HIS. FACE.\n\nSeriously. He coughed into his fist and then just a few moments later moved the offending hand to his face and touched it, right beside his nose.\n\nYou literally can\u2019t make this stuff up, y\u2019all.\n\nIt\u2019s really no wonder people are panic buying toilet paper and potatoes when this is the administration we\u2019re currently forced to depend on to pull us out of the trenches.\n\nFeatured image via screen capture\n\nLike what you see here?
