No.\n\n\"We did something to track [things]. It's 900,000 euros a year.\n\n\"We commissioned a study a few weeks ago to shed light on this.\n\n\"Barcelona have an obligation to keep looking at what's going on in the digital world.\n\n\"We look around the world; we have a brand that must be preserved. Our obligation is this.\n\n\"I spoke to the players and they told me to be calm. I am calm.\"\n\nThere have been increasingly vocal calls for Bartomeu to resign from his position and bring forward elections, which are currently due in 2021, but he looked to point out that the club are currently in a transitional phase between two different generations.\n\n\"I joined the club in 2003 as a director,\" he continued.\n\n\"We began an era of many successes.\n\n\"Over the years, we have won many trophies, most of them at a world-class level.\n\n\"There are many opponents who prepare and study how we play.\n\n\"We're having a transition in terms of playing how we want to.\n\n\"This generation competes a lot, and there's another young generation coming through.\n\n\"When there is a generational change, many clubs stop competing.\n\n\"At Barcelona, I'm happy because this doesn't happen.\"\n\nBartomeu also discussed Lionel Messi's future, making clear that he sees the Argentine's long-term future at the Camp Nou.\n\n\"He's the best player in the world,\" the president stated.\n\n\"He's clear on that.\n\n\"Messi will stay at Barcelona and will retire at Barcelona.\"\n\nThe decision to replace Ernesto Valverde with Quique Setien is a subject that has been much discussed, with Bartomeu revealing that it was the right time to offer the former Real Betis coach a chance to take the reins at Barcelona.\n\n\"We are a club of coaches, because they have a very important weight in our concept of an organisation,\" Bartomeu explained.\n\n\"A new dynamic was needed.\n\n\"Talking to the directors, we thought it was time to give Setien a chance.\n\n\"He is keen to show that this model is in place today.\n\n\"Today, there is no one who creates a school like Barcelona's.\n\n\"Many clubs have taken notice of us.\"\n\nEder Sarabia, Setien's assistant, was met with some criticism for the way in which he was criticising Barcelona's play and their players during the Clasico defeat to Real Madrid, but Bartomeu actually liked the character he showed.\n\n\"The actions are not the right ones for a club like Barcelona,\" Bartomeu said.\n\n\"Deep down, I agree with the coach.\n\n\"But having character is good.\"\n\nNeymar's case against Barcelona is still ongoing, with the Brazilian believing that he is owed money as part of a bonus payment prior to departing the club in 2017, yet Bartomeu has stated that they are awaiting the final verdict from the court.\n\n\"We are awaiting the judgement,\" Bartomeu noted.\n\n\"We've gotten used to the Neymar issue.\n\n\"It is not a priority issue.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["", "Marca English"], "tags": ["Marca English"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 10 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "With news that Barcelona's Champions League match against Napoli will be played at an empty Camp Nou, Blaugrana president Josep Maria Bartomeu...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.marca.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": ",Marca English", "news_keywords": ",Marca English", "robots": "index,follow", "theme-color": "#CC0000", "organization": "Unidad Editorial Informaci\u00f3n Deportiva S.L.", "DC.date.issued": "2020-03-10T17:49:41Z", "date": "2020-03-10T15:21:45Z", "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-10T15:21:45Z", "modified_time": "2020-03-10T17:49:41Z", "section": "En/football/barcelona", "tag": "Marca English"}, "twitter": {"site": "@MarcainEnglish", "creator": "@MarcainEnglish", "title": "Bartomeu: Playing behind closed doors against Napoli will cost Barcelona six million euros", "description": "With news that Barcelona&apos;s Champions League match against Napoli will be played at an empty Camp Nou, Blaugrana president Josep Maria Bartomeu...", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2020/03/10/15838523287429.jpg"}, "description": "With news that Barcelona&apos;s Champions League match against Napoli will be played at an empty Camp Nou, Blaugrana president Josep Maria Bartomeu...", "og": {"title": "Bartomeu: Playing behind closed doors against Napoli will cost Barcelona six million euros", "description": "With news that Barcelona&apos;s Champions League match against Napoli will be played at an empty Camp Nou, Blaugrana president Josep Maria Bartomeu...", "url": "https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2020/03/10/5e67b01ae2704e6a9a8b4603.html", "image": "https://e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2020/03/10/15838523287429.jpg", "type": "article", "site_name": "MARCA in English"}, "fb": {"app_id": 135978896526107}, "referrer": "unsafe-url"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2020/03/10/5e67b01ae2704e6a9a8b4603.html"}
