The PUIs are still admitted at the referral facility,\" Health Assistant Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a media briefing.\n\nThis is contrary to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III's earlier statement that all 13 symptomatic repatriates have tested negative for the highly-infectious illness.\n\nEight of the 10 who tested negative are set to be sent back to the New Clark City Athlete's Village to complete their quarantine after recovering from their mild illnesses.\n\nAll in all, 445 Filipinos \u2014 mostly crew members \u2014 were brought home from the Diamond Princess cruise ship last week. The repatriates, along with the health and foreign affairs personnel and volunteers from the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo who helped bring them home, were transported to the sporting village in Tarlac for the second round of 14-day quarantine.\n\nOverseas Workers Welfare Administration Administrator Hans Cacdac said the Filipino crew will be given P10,000 each and transportation allowance to travel from New Clark City to their homes in the Philippines once they complete the quarantine requirements.\n\nThe repatriation did not include 80 Filipinos who have fallen ill to COVID-19 in Japan. Of this number, 32 have already recovered. Ten of those have already returned to the Philippines, while 22 other await repatriation details and will undergo strict DOH monitoring.\n\nSome Americans, Britons, and Australians who were previously on the Diamond Princess only tested positive for coronavirus after they returned home from a 14-day quarantine. Among them is a 78-year-old man from Perth, Australia who became that country's first reported death due to the virus.\n\nThe World Health Organization said the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea, while others become infected but don\u2019t develop any symptoms. About 80 percent of those infected recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who get COVID-19 become seriously ill and develop difficulty breathing. Older people and those with underlying medical problmes like high blood pressure or diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness, the WHO added.\n\nThere are 43 patients under investigation admitted in various hospitals. The Philippines has three confirmed COVID-19 cases. Two of them have already recovered and returned to China, while one died \u2014 the first recorded death outside of mainland China.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Mar  2 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "This is contrary to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III's earlier statement that all 13 symptomatic repatriates have tested negative for the highly-infectious illness.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/.resources/demo-cnn-new/webresources/img/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 343451476306798, "pages": "1515763818663512, 1576823632632003"}, "robots": "all", "description": "This is contrary to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III's earlier statement that all 13 symptomatic repatriates have tested negative for the highly-infectious illness.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@cnnphilippines", "image": "https://cnnphilippines.com/.imaging/mte/demo-cnn-new/750x450/dam/cnn/2020/2/26/Diamond-Princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus_5_CNNPH.jpg/jcr:content/Diamond-Princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus_5_CNNPH.jpg"}, "og": {"image": {"identifier": "http://cnnphilippines.com/.imaging/mte/demo-cnn-new/750x450/dam/cnn/2020/2/26/Diamond-Princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus_5_CNNPH.jpg/jcr:content/Diamond-Princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus_5_CNNPH.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cnnphilippines.com/.imaging/mte/demo-cnn-new/750x450/dam/cnn/2020/2/26/Diamond-Princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus_5_CNNPH.jpg/jcr:content/Diamond-Princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus_5_CNNPH.jpg"}, "title": "10 quarantined Filipinos test negative for coronavirus, 4 await lab results", "type": "article", "url": "https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/3/2/Coronavirus-Philippines-Diamond-Princesss-quarantine.html?fbclid=IwAR1bOZ2A65lCDONsNXDcjqtF8vX7W1jYUkLIdosSizksjOvNgb43u4U2hVI", "description": "This is contrary to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III's earlier statement that all 13 symptomatic repatriates have tested negative for the highly-infectious illness.", "site_name": "cnn"}, "google-site-verification": "3JBhzuGftJP66AoozLCqVfGifHvzp9mwwAbENn4t6j0", "msapplication-TileImage": "//cnnphilippines.com/static/theme/default/base/ico/windowsmetro-144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF"}, "canonical_link": "http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/3/2/Coronavirus-Philippines-Diamond-Princesss-quarantine.html?fbclid=IwAR1bOZ2A65lCDONsNXDcjqtF8vX7W1jYUkLIdosSizksjOvNgb43u4U2hVI"}
