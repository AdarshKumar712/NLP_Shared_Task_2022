D. from two center for higher studies, the International Seagull Award and an Honorary Mention from the University of Puebla.\n\n\n\nIn this capital, the ceremony would take place after the 27th Havana International Ballet Festival and prior to the 42nd International Festival of New Latin American Cinema, so as not to coincide with other great events.\n\n\n\nMartin intends to bring together artists from North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean, among others, and from the list of honorees, he has brought forward Cuban maestros Guido L\u00f3pez Gavil\u00e1n, Enrique P\u00e9rez Mesa, Zenaida Romeu, Ulises Aquino, and Frank Fern\u00e1ndez.\n\n\n\n\"The awards gala would include performances and we would, of course, invite the great maestros to be part of the shows,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIn his opinion, the ideal place to present the Batuta Awards is the Garc\u00eda Lorca hall of the Alicia Alonso Gran Teatro de La Habana and Mart\u00edn thanked the Ministry of Culture and the Cuban Music Institute for their support.\n\n\n\nAccording to Mart\u00edn, his management of the Batuta Awards will try to do justice in life to many great maestros, and for this reason, the award could have several itinerant editions in the same year, at least in its first five years.\n\n\n\nAfterward, it could be held annually or, perhaps, one in Asia, one in Europe and one in America, in respect for such wealth, he said.\n\n\n\nThis year, Mart\u00edn will support the production of a documentary to celebrate the centennial of the ILM in 2021, under the direction of Cuban musician Edesio Alejandro, who is the ILM's cultural ambassador and an active member of the Hollywood Film Academy.\n\n\n\nIn addition, he will produce a song performed by several Cuban musicians and Mexican singer Lila Down, a multi-award winning folklorist who recently became the first artist from her country to be named cultural ambassador of the ILM.\n\n\n\nCurrently, the ILM is growing inward, I love this idea, we are trying not only to be in the big cities but to reach municipalities, and perhaps more intricate regions, we are doing studies of folklore.\n\n\n\n\"I think we should look inward, toward our ancestors, and be very proud of that,\" Mart\u00edn concluded.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Luis E Amador", "radio enciclopedia", "International Batuta Awards Ceremony 2020", "Cuba", "Latin Music Institute (ILM)", "Daniel Martin"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cmbq Radio Enciclopedia"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  8 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The president of the Latin Music Institute (ILM), Daniel Martin, recently announced that he plans to hold an edition of the Batuta Awards this year in Havana, Cuba, in November.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.radioenciclopedia.cu/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "language": "en", "title": "International Batuta Awards Ceremony to be Held in Cuba in 2020", "keywords": "Luis E Amador,radio enciclopedia,International Batuta Awards Ceremony 2020, Cuba, Latin Music Institute (ILM), Daniel Martin", "description": "The president of the Latin Music Institute (ILM), Daniel Martin, recently announced that he plans to hold an edition of the Batuta Awards this year in Havana, Cuba, in November.", "robots": "all", "abstract": "Specials, CMBQ Radio Enciclopedia, Cuban Radio, Cuba, Culture", "distribution": "Global", "category": "Medios de Difusi\u00f3n", "identifier-url": "http://www.radioenciclopedia.cu/cultural-news/exclusive/international-batuta-awards-ceremony-to-be-held-in-cuba-in-2020-20200108/", "author": "CMBQ Radio Enciclopedia", "reply-to": "web@renciclopedia.icrt.cu", "copyright": "CMBQ Radio Enciclopedia", "subject": "International Batuta Awards Ceremony to be Held in Cuba in 2020 - CMBQ Radio Enciclopedia", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@enciclopedia_cu"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.radioenciclopedia.cu/cultural-news/exclusive/international-batuta-awards-ceremony-to-be-held-in-cuba-in-2020-20200108/", "title": "International Batuta Awards Ceremony to be Held in Cuba in 2020. - CMBQ Radio Enciclopedia", "description": "The president of the Latin Music Institute (ILM), Daniel Martin, recently announced that he plans to hold an edition of the Batuta Awards this year in Havana, Cuba, in November.", "image": "http://www.radioenciclopedia.cu/images/images/cultura2020/enero/0-cubadsde.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "http://www.radioenciclopedia.cu/cultural-news/exclusive/international-batuta-awards-ceremony-to-be-held-in-cuba-in-2020-20200108/"}
