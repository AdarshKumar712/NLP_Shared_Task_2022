This is a tragic reminder of how serious the flu can be for both children and adults,\u2019\u2019 said Public Health Commissioner Dr. Monica Bharel in a statement.\n\n\u201cEvery flu season is different, but January and February are typically the height of flu season. We want people to know that it\u2019s not too late to get a flu shot,\u201d said Bharel.\n\nThe child tested positive for influenza B, a common type of flu in pediatric patients.\n\nThis season, between 2,000 to 3,000 Massachusetts residents have been hospitalized with the flu, and there have been 15,000 to 20,000 emergency room visits, according to DPH.\n\nLast flu season, there were four confirmed pediatric flu-related deaths in Massachusetts. As of Jan. 11, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a total of 39 pediatric flu deaths this season across the nation.\n\n\u201cFlu vaccination is our best protection against illness,\u201d said Dr. Larry Madoff, medical director of the Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences. \u201cPeople also should remember to wash their hands, cover their cough and sneeze, and stay home when they are sick to limit the spread of disease.\u201d\n\nBabies, the elderly and those with chronic illness are most susceptible to the flu and flu-related complications.\n\nThe most common symptoms are fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills, runny nose and fatigue.\n\nThe flu vaccine is still available and it is not too late to get vaccinated as the flu season will continue to run for many more weeks.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Department of Public Health", "Flu Season", "Worcester"], "authors": ["Alexi Cohan", "Alexi Cohan Is A General Assignment Reporter Covering Local News", "Government As Well As Health", "Medicine Stories.
