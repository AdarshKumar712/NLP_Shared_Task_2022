It says players and staff at each club - or around 40 to 50 people - should be tested and then isolated in a training camp to begin their preparations.\n\nFor the first week, players would have to train individually, respecting social distancing guidelines. If, after that, there are no positive cases, teams can start normal training.\n\nIn an interview with the same newspaper, a leading Italian virologist said it would not be necessary to stop the whole competition if a player tested positive.\n\nFrancesco Vaia, of the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases, said the re-opening of the country, including football, needed a combination of \u201ccommon sense and science which should go hand-in-hand\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to stop everything if a player tests positive,\u201d Vaia said.\n\n\u201cThe answer is to treat football in the same way as healthcare workers. If I find a healthcare worker who tests positive, I don\u2019t suspend everyone from work. We put those who came into contact with him under observation with blood tests and swabs.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Long Reads", "Francesco Vaia", "Fp Exclusives", "Coronavirus", "Coronavirus Outbreak", "Covid-19", "New India", "Coronavirus Pandemic"], "authors": ["Updated Date"], "publish_date": "Sat Apr 25 18:23:47 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Clubs in Italy\u2019s Serie A will donate five COVID-19 test kits for every one they use once they start training for a possible resumption of the season, a report in the Corriere dello Sport newspaper said on Saturday.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/favicon.ico?v=6.55", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "description": "Clubs in Italy\u2019s Serie A will donate five COVID-19 test kits for every one they use once they start training for a possible resumption of the season, a report in the Corriere dello Sport newspaper said on Saturday.", "news_keywords": "coronavirus,Coronavirus outbreak,Coronavirus Pandemic,COVID-19,Francesco Vaia,Gabriele Gravina,Italian Football Federation (FIGC),Italy,KickingAround,Serie A,Vincenzo Spadafora", "Keywords": "coronavirus,Coronavirus outbreak,Coronavirus Pandemic,COVID-19,Francesco Vaia,Gabriele Gravina,Italian Football Federation (FIGC),Italy,KickingAround,Serie A,Vincenzo Spadafora", "og": {"title": "Coronavirus Outbreak: Serie A clubs will donate COVID-19 test kits, claims newspaper report - Health News , Firstpost", "description": "Clubs in Italy\u2019s Serie A will donate five COVID-19 test kits for every one they use once they start training for a possible resumption of the season, a report in the Corriere dello Sport newspaper said on Saturday.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Firstpost", "type": "article", "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Premier-league-Football-generic-Reuters-social.jpg", "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/health/coronavirus-outbreak-serie-a-clubs-will-donate-covid-19-test-kits-claims-newspaper-report-8300051.html", "updated_time": "2020-04-25T18:23:47+05:30"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1162386820478832, "admins": 500851548, "pages": 165818073477856}, "twitter": {"title": "Coronavirus Outbreak: Serie A clubs will donate COVID-19 test kits, claims newspaper report - Health News , Firstpost", "description": "Clubs in Italy\u2019s Serie A will donate five COVID-19 test kits for every one they use once they start training for a possible resumption of the season, a report in the Corriere dello Sport newspaper said on Saturday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 4503599627804328, "image": {"src": "https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Premier-league-Football-generic-Reuters-social.jpg"}, "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "domain": "Firstpost", "site": "@firstpost", "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/health/coronavirus-outbreak-serie-a-clubs-will-donate-covid-19-test-kits-claims-newspaper-report-8300051.html"}, "article": {"tag": "Vincenzo Spadafora", "section": "Health", "published_time": "2020-04-25T18:23:47+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-04-25T18:23:47+05:30"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.firstpost.com/health/coronavirus-outbreak-serie-a-clubs-will-donate-covid-19-test-kits-claims-newspaper-report-8300051.html"}
