The BBB said 163 people in North Texas alerted the BBB to phishing scams this year. You should never trust unsolicited messages asking for your personal information.\n\nWhile buying her first home, Gracie Veronica wired money to someone she thought was her title officer after receiving a convincing email.\n\nShe lost $45,000 in one fell swoop.\n\n\u201cFor someone to come and take away what I\u2019ve been saving up for years\u2026.what am I going to do now?\u201d said Veronica. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous amount of money, and I\u2019ve worked so hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is just to stay vigilant,\u201d said Devin Dedeaux of the BBB. \u201cKeep a suspicious eye for things you don\u2019t recognize.\u201d\n\nThe easiest way to spot a phishing email is to check for proper grammar and spelling.\n\nWith 116 reports, the second biggest scam of 2019 dealt with online purchases.\n\nScammers may pretend to sell you an item but never deliver the goods.\n\nThe best defense is making sure you\u2019re buying from a secure website. In the URL, look for a padlock and the letters \u201ch-t-t-p-s.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake sure you\u2019re looking for an address, contact number, and email in case something goes awry and you need to get in contact with the company,\u201d Dedeaux advised.\n\nEmployment scams ranked third with 73 reports. The BBB said crooks take advantage of people by \u201caccidentally\u201d overpaying employees with a fake check and then asking them to wire back the difference. Workers could also be asked to buy expensive equipment with their own money.\n\nTake Larissa Royster, for example. Through an online posting, she found a gig that required her to print bad checks on paper that she was expected to buy herself. The bank alerted her to the fraudulent scheme.\n\nBeware of any employer asking you to pay upfront for training fees or to immediately provide banking information to run a background or credit check.\n\n\u201cIf someone gives you a job before they\u2019ve interviewed you, you need to be cautious,\u201d Dedeaux said.\n\nHere are the other top scams of 2019, according to the BBB:\n\n4. Fake check/money order scam (43 reports)\n\n5. Tech support scam (34 reports)\n\n6. Lottery scam (31 reports)\n\n7. Debt collection scam (29 reports)\n\n8. Government grant scam (27 reports)\n\n9. Credit card scam (20 reports)\n\n10. Advanced fee loan scam (13 reports)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["ones for justice", "north texas", "scams", "better business bureau", "bbb", "top scams of 2019", "phishing", "online shopping", "employment scams", "dfw news"], "tags": ["Top Scams of 2019", "DFW News", "scams", "Ones For Justice", "Phishing", "BBB", "Online Shopping", "Better Business Bureau", "Employment Scams", "North Texas"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "In 2019, consumers in North Texas reported losing nearly $350,000 to scam artists, according to the Better Business Bureau.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://dfw.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909545/2019/07/cropped-dfw-favicon-512.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "ones for justice, north texas, scams, better business bureau, bbb, top scams of 2019, phishing, online shopping, employment scams, dfw news", "keywords": "ones for justice, north texas, scams, better business bureau, bbb, top scams of 2019, phishing, online shopping, employment scams, dfw news", "fb": {"pages": 108571612499317}, "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"title": "Ones For Justice Tackles Top Scams Of 2019 In North Texas", "image": {"identifier": "https://dfw.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909545/2020/01/6EE1A5EEB8634D2A8F0ACD1D948A0EF8.jpg?w=855", "secure_url": "https://dfw.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909545/2020/01/6EE1A5EEB8634D2A8F0ACD1D948A0EF8.jpg?w=855", "width": 855, "height": 481}, "description": "In 2019, consumers in North Texas reported losing nearly $350,000 to scam artists, according to the Better Business Bureau.", "type": "article", "url": "https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2020/01/01/ones-for-justice-tackles-top-scams-2019-north-texas/"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T07:10:32+00:00", "suggested-social-copy": "In 2019, consumers in North Texas reported losing nearly $350,000 to scam artists, according to the Better Business Bureau.", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSDFW", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSDFW"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://dfw.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909545/2020/01/6EE1A5EEB8634D2A8F0ACD1D948A0EF8.jpg?w=855", "title": "Ones For Justice Tackles Top Scams Of 2019 In North Texas", "description": "In 2019, consumers in North Texas reported losing nearly $350,000 to scam artists, according to the Better Business Bureau.", "site": "CBSDFW"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://dfw.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909545/2019/07/cropped-dfw-favicon-512.png?w=270", "description": "In 2019, consumers in North Texas reported losing nearly $350,000 to scam artists, according to the Better Business Bureau."}, "canonical_link": "https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2020/01/01/ones-for-justice-tackles-top-scams-2019-north-texas/"}
