Above all, the party is targeting the 258,000 voters who switched from the FP\u00d6 to the \u00d6VP in the 2019 elections.\n\nAnd the party certainly needs to change a few things.\n\nAfter ruling alongside Chancellor Kurz\u2019s conservative \u00d6VP until the government\u2019s collapse in May 2019 with a 26% share of the vote, the party has suffered a deep fall. The so-called \u2018Ibiza-gate\u2019 scandal led to Heinz-Christian Strache\u2019s resignation as Vice-Chancellor and FP\u00d6 leader, followed by an affair involving misuse of party funds.\n\nBut after new elections were held in September following the government\u2019s collapse in May, the FP\u00d6 slipped by almost ten percentage points. The party then had to watch its former government partner form a new coalition \u2013 with the Greens, a party seemingly with little in common with the FP\u00d6.\n\nOn top of that, there is the persistent problem of FP\u00d6 members being associated with extreme right-wing movements, despite the party leadership publicly condemning them.\n\nThe blue vest needs to turn white\n\nThe green light for reforming the party was given at the party retreat on 8-9 December 2019. In the preceding months, working groups had begun work on the FP\u00d6\u2019s new image.\n\nBut what would this \u201cmodern right-wing conservative party\u201d, in the words of party leader Norbert Hofer, look like? The party\u2019s focus on migration, security and social issues remains the same, but there is now a stronger focus on family policy.\n\nBut after the FP\u00d6 scandals surrounding corruption and right-wing extremism, the key is to wash the slate clean. For instance, party leader Hofer announced the implementation of new compliance rules for the FP\u00d6 and its members which are stricter than for any other party, with the aim of preventing new financial scandals.\n\nAnd to prevent cases of right-wing extremism, the party membership criteria should be tightened, with applicants having to make the commitment to respect the rule of law, democracy and non-violence.\n\n\u201cWe remain a right-wing party\u201d\n\nAndreas Rabl, the mayor of Wels who chaired the working group for the FP\u00d6\u2019s modernisation, explained exactly how this commitment would work in an interview with EURACTIV.\n\nAnyone who applies online for party membership must first watch explanatory videos which show \u201cthat we do not want racists, anti-Semites or right-wing extremists in our party\u201d, Rabl said.\n\nThen, a set of ten questions, which Rabl calls \u201cthe Ten Commandments of Democracy\u201d, need to be answered. Such questions include, for instance, whether one is committed to the rule of law. Only those who answer these questions correctly are eligible to become party members.\n\nBut Rabl emphasised that \u201cwe remain a right-wing party because the basic principles of the right political spectrum are important to us: Home, merit, personal responsibility and family.\u201d\n\nAnd new financial compliance rules are primarily about rebuilding lost credibility, as Rabl appears to understand that after all the scandals, FP\u00d6 voters are \u201cdisappointed, very disappointed\u201d.\n\nAccording to Rabl, the FP\u00d6 is now demonstrating firmness by highlighting it has \u201cunderstood the message, we are sorry\u201d.\n\nOn the search for new voters\n\nBut where will the new voters come from?\n\nFirst of all, Rabl wants to appeal to new strata of the population as it has, until now, been particularly weak among women, academics and in cities.\n\nThe FP\u00d6 wants to win female votes by setting new priorities in family policy: Women should be able to choose more freely between bringing up children and a career, for example, by improving childcare facilities. The FP\u00d6 also intends to promise more for single parents.\n\nAnd by implementing the new compliance rules, the FP\u00d6 could convince academics because \u201cbetter educated, in particular, people attach great importance to transparency\u201d, says Rabl. Besides, it would also persuade academics through \u201cmore differentiated argumentation\u201d, by making counterproposals and not just rejecting other parties\u2019 proposals in the future.\n\nRegaining the trust of 258,000 voters\n\nThe FP\u00d6 is also seeking to regain the trust of the 258,000 voters who switched from the FP\u00d6 to the \u00d6VP in 2019.\n\nAccording to Rabl, the majority of them are \u201calready disappointed by the \u00d6VP\u201d because these people demand strict integration and migration policies, and such measures cannot be implemented with the Greens, even if these are part of the government programme. To get them back, the FP\u00d6 now wants to become the \u201cguardian of the grail of migration policy\u201d.\n\nLore Hayek, an expert in political communication, suspects that this could lead to fierce competition because the \u00d6VP will not give up these voters without a fight.\n\nAccording to Hayek, the harsh migration policy that is now part of the government programme, which many Greens regret, is conveying the message to those who switched parties that the ruling conservative party \u201cis continuing the centre-right course\u201d.\n\nAs a counter-tactic, the FP\u00d6 says that if voters want an FP\u00d6 policy, they should vote for the FP\u00d6. The party will do everything in its power to discredit the government\u2019s migration policy, arguing that even if the \u00d6VP wants to take a hard line here, it is not feasible with the Greens as coalition partners.\n\n\u201cGreta Coalition\u201d\n\nHerbert Kickl, chairman od the FP\u00d6\u2019s parliamentary club and, according to Hayek, the most important party strategist, called the government a \u201cGreta coalition\u201d and accused the \u00d6VP of shifting to the left. Kickl also criticised the government\u2019s stance on preventive detention as part of its migration policy, providing a foretaste of his party\u2019s communication strategy.\n\nPreventive detention, originally an FP\u00d6 idea, was not feasible with the Greens, according to Kickl. Should it fail, the FP\u00d6 would perceive it as deceiving the electorate and would campaign hard on the matter.\n\nThis is what Mayor Rabl meant by being the \u201cguardian of the Grail of migration policy\u201d.\n\nHayek suggests that this strategy of washing its vest, while discrediting the government\u2019s policy is precisely what the FP\u00d6 needs right now.\n\nBut will a \u2018reformed\u2019 FP\u00d6 be able to convince new people of its merits?\n\n(Edited by Benjamin Fox)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan 15 17:11:14 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Austria's right-wing populist party FP\u00d6 has launched a rebranding exercise with the aim of becoming a \"modern right-wing conservative party\", EURACTIV Germany reports.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/themes/euractiv_com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "wp-parsely_version": "2.1.3", "robots": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot-news": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Austria's right-wing populist party FP\u00d6 has launched a rebranding exercise with the aim of becoming a \"modern right-wing conservative party\", EURACTIV Germany reports.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Could FP\u00d6's new 'modern' strategy save Austria's populist party?", "description": "Austria's right-wing populist party FP\u00d6 has launched a rebranding exercise with the aim of becoming a \"modern right-wing conservative party\", EURACTIV Germany reports.", "image": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/w_55220371-1-800x450.jpg"}, "og": {"title": "Could FP\u00d6's new 'modern' strategy save Austria's populist party?", "url": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/could-fpos-new-modern-strategy-save-austrias-populist-party/", "type": "article", "site_name": "www.euractiv.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/w_55220371-1-800x450.jpg", "alt": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/could-fpos-new-modern-strategy-save-austrias-populist-party/"}, "description": "Austria's right-wing populist party FP\u00d6 has launched a rebranding exercise with the aim of becoming a \"modern right-wing conservative party\", EURACTIV Germany reports."}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-15 17:11:14", "author": "Philipp Gr\u00fcll", "section": "Politics", "tag": "right-wing populism"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/ea_favicon_16x16.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/could-fpos-new-modern-strategy-save-austrias-populist-party/"}
