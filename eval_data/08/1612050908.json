Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food, the CDC said. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover coughing or sneezing and wash hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.\n\nIt may be possible that a person can get the coronavirus by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\n\nIn general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging, like packaging coming from the Dole plant.\n\nRELATED: Outbreak of 20 cases linked to Dole plant\n\nThe health district said it has been working closely with Dole to monitor and contain the outbreak since the first case was detected April 22, and said Dole has \u201cgone above and beyond the required safety precautions\u201d and assisted with contact tracing and telling those affected to stay home and to quarantine.\n\nThank you for reading the Springfield News-Sun and for supporting local journalism.
