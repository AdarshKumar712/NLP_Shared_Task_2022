Inspired from the Dutch painter and his struggles, he decided to curate an experience on Van Gogh\u2019s life in Delhi.\n\nSo, Agarwal is organising a workshop titled, Loving Vincent \u2013 Movie Screening & Paint Party. Here participants can view Van Gogh\u2019s world through the beautifully animated movie Loving Vincent.\n\n\n\nRachit says, \u201cWith the inspirations drawn out of the movie and with the rhythm of jazz in the background, the participants can create their own versions of an extremely famous Van Gogh painting, ie, Starry Nights.\u201d\n\nAgarwal chose Starry Night to be reinterpreted at the workshop because Vincent Van Gogh painted it in a unique style when he was in the asylum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe ambience in the painting evokes some rather strong emotions, hence, this painting is instantly recognisable and has been promoted extensively.\n\n\n\nPeople all over the world love to own a Starry Night, while artists love to explore their own styles and come up with their interpretation of this painting.\u201d\n\nArtist Mansha Bedi mentored by acclaimed Rameshwar Broota will guide the participants.\n\n\n\nWhen: January 25, 11.00 am-3.00 pm\n\nWhere: Delhi\u2019s The Stainless Gallery", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Rachit Agarwal", "Ptah", "Van Gogh Museum", "Starry Night"], "tags": ["Van Gogh Museum", "India Matters", "Ptah", "Rachit Agarwal", "Starry Night"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Jan 24 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Rachit Agarwal chose Starry Night to be reinterpreted at the workshop because\u00a0Vincent Van Gogh painted it in a unique style when he was in the asylum.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://images.newindianexpress.com/images/FrontEnd/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Create your own version of 'Starry Night'", "description": "Rachit Agarwal chose Starry Night to be reinterpreted at the workshop because\u00a0Vincent Van Gogh painted it in a unique style when he was in the asylum.", "keywords": "Rachit Agarwal, Ptah, Van Gogh Museum, Starry Night", "news_keywords": "Rachit Agarwal, Ptah, Van Gogh Museum, Starry Night", "msvalidate.01": "E3846DEF0DE4D18E294A6521B2CEBBD2", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"pages": 178988994793}, "og": {"url": "https://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/hindi/2020/jan/24/create-your-own-version-of-starry-night-2093870.html", "type": "article", "title": "Create your own version of 'Starry Night'", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/1/24/w600X390/Create___.jpg", "width": 450, "height": 298}, "site_name": "The New Indian Express", "description": "Rachit Agarwal chose Starry Night to be reinterpreted at the workshop because\u00a0Vincent Van Gogh painted it in a unique style when he was in the asylum."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "NewIndianXpress", "site": "@newindianexpress.com", "title": "Create your own version of 'Starry Night'", "description": "Rachit Agarwal chose Starry Night to be reinterpreted at the workshop because\u00a0Vincent Van Gogh painted it in a unique style when he was in the asylum.", "image": "https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/1/24/w600X390/Create___.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/hindi/2020/jan/24/create-your-own-version-of-starry-night-2093870.html"}
