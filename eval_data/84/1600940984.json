Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz (\u00d6VP) stated on Sunday, March 15 that this will be a hard week, and the federal government is finding ways to support companies that have taken a hit due to coronavirus countermeasures.\n\nOne of these was announced the same day: a \u20ac4 billion relief package, which Chancellor Kurz and Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler (Greens) stated will include \u201ccash on hand\u201d for the self-employed to weather the crisis. The pot is set to feed into various funds, including some that are specifically for the self-employed and family businesses.\n\nOn March 18, the package was expanded to \u20ac38 billion and in the press conference, both Kurz and Kogler stressed that no business that has suffered from the security measures would be left behind. The package also includes various incentives for keeping employees (see below) and delaying tax payments until revenues are back at normal levels.\n\nWhat\u2019s included in the package?\n\nFurther aid for businesses includes expanding Kurzarbeit (short-time work), allowing employees to reduce their work output to zero with the state paying up to 90% of their salary. The measure seeks to ensure that companies aren\u2019t forced to lay people off due to temporary revenue shortages. Kurz said the costs would turn their projected minor budget surplus into a \u201cmassive deficit,\u201d but Finance Minister Gernot Bl\u00fcmel (\u00d6VP) stressed that \u201cthere will be as much money there as needed.\u201d\n\nThe Ministry of Finance offers a combined form for companies and the self-employed to request tax relief to secure companies\u2019 liquidity, according to Bl\u00fcmel. The form can be sent to [email protected] of uploaded on the FinanzOnline account of the company. Here is what you can request:\n\nA reduction of advance payments (Vorauszahlungen) for income tax (Einkommensteuer) or corporate tax (K\u00f6rperschaftssteuer) to zero\n\nSuspension of interest on back taxes owed (Nichtfestsetzung von Anspruchszinsen)\n\nDelayed payment or payment by instalments\n\nA waiver or reduction of overdue fees\n\nOther relief measures for companies and opportunities to apply will be released over the coming days and will be updated here in English. The funds for tourism, gastronomy and other event-related companies will start accepting applications in the week of March 23.\n\nCompanies can find detailed information by sector in German on this page.\n\nRelief for Viennese businesses\n\nThe City of Vienna and Vienna Chamber of Commerce have announced their own \u20ac35 million aid package for local businesses, the largest in the latter organization\u2019s history. Measures include:\n\n\u20ac12 million in guarantees to ensure liquidity for Viennese SMEs (backed by the private bank Wiener Kreditb\u00fcrgschafts- und Beteiligungsbank)\n\n\u20ac20 million emergency funding for the self-employed and very small companies (applications can be submitted starting April 1)\n\nA \u20ac3 million increase of WAFF funds for labor foundations (Arbeitsstiftungen)\n\nCity Hall has a website dedicated to the coronavirus measures; in addition, both the Austrian and Viennese Chambers of commerce have all the relevant information and available forms. Their Frequently Asked Questions page has a list of all planned relief efforts and will link to the proper application forms as they are annouced.\n\nWe will continue to publish information regarding aid for companies on this page as the situation unfolds.
