According to Nguyen Minh Thao at the Central Institute of Economic Management, two of these five components were recognised for reforms, namely access to credit and payment of taxes and social insurance. Nevertheless, the head of government\u2019s instructions still demonstrate a strong resolve for continued reform.\n\nIn fact, Vietnam currently has many advantages over other economies in attracting foreign investment. In a recent ranking by the US News & World Report, Vietnam jumped from number 23 to number 8 on the list of the best countries to invest in. An annual survey by the Japan External Trade Organisation also shows that 70% of the Japanese companies operating in Vietnam plan to expand their business in Asia and ASEAN, particularly in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to economist Vo Tri Thanh, foreign investors are seizing opportunities from the new changes in the world and in Vietnam, so there are reasons to be optimistic for the next ten years.\n\nWith the stability of the macroeconomic foundations and strong economic growth at above 6.5% over the past 5 years, Vietnam has become one of the fastest growing economies in the region, thereby attracting large investment inflow.\n\nHowever, more challenges are expected to emerge in the coming years, requiring both the government and enterprises to take bold actions to take advantage of the opportunities, said Thanh.\n\nNew policy-making mindset\n\nUnder its tentative programme, the Vietnam Reform and Development Forum (VRDF) 2019 was scheduled to begin at 8:30 in the morning but Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Chi Dung had arrived an hour earlier. Discussions on Vietnam\u2019s prosperity and the opportunities and challenges facing the country had already heated up before the official opening hour.\n\nThe VRDF is customarily held at the end of the year. But 2020 is a special year in which Vietnam will formulate the socio-economic development strategy for 2021-2030 and the socio-economic development plan for 2021-2025. It is also the year to complete the documents to be presented to the 13th National Party Congress.\n\nFurthermore, a rapidly changing world, with the advent of never-seen-before technologies that are transforming the way of doing business, has made traditional successes inadequate in realising Vietnam\u2019s aspiration for prosperity.\n\n\u201cSuch context brings about both opportunities and challenges for developing countries like Vietnam, requiring it to quickly seize the opportunities and overcome the challenges, otherwise it will fail to catch up with the current development trends\u201d, said Minister Nguyen Chi Dung in his address with domestic and foreign experts to explain why VRDF 2019 was held earlier than usual. What the organisers had intended was to create a forum to garner suggestions and recommendations for the new stage of Vietnam\u2019s development.\n\nSuch challenges had already been mentioned a long time ago. In a traditional development model, land, capital and the labour force are the most important resources in attracting investment. In the case of Vietnam, the main factors have been cheap labour and natural resources. But with new business models, ideas, intelligence and connectedness will now be the main resources.\n\nEconomic prosperity in the future calls for a new mindset in the formulation of mechanisms and policies, said economist Tran Dinh Thien.\n\nIt is apparent that the drivers and development structure of the fourth industrial revolution require radical changes in policy formulation and institutional reforms so that the drivers can be determined correctly towards bolstering development.\n\nThien reiterated that although the fourth industrial revolution is a technological revolution, it should go hand in hand with institutional reform. It is also the reason why institutional reform is still brought up by economic experts as Vietnam\u2019s key to the door of prosperity.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["vietnam news", "vietnam business", "vietnam travel", "vietnam culture", "vietnam sports", "vietnam politics", "hanoi", "saigon", "ho chi minh city", "apec", "da nang", "hue", "hoi an", "vietnam development", "asean", "nhandan", "vietnam arts", "vietnam food", "vietnam english", "vietnam war", "vietnam history", "vietnam headlines", "vietnam government", "vietnam people", "east sea", "south china sea", "paracel", "spratly", "hoang sa", "truong sa", "ha long bay", "son doong"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "NDO - The question of how Vietnam will develop in the next 10 and 20 years is not only for policymakers.
