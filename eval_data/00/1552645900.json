These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don\u2019t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.\n\n\n\nWhen to seek medical help?\n\n\n\nMost people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.\n\n\n\nOlder people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.\n\n\n\nPeople with fever, cough and difficulty in breathing should seek medical attention.\n\n\n\nBasic protective measures against the new coronavirus:\n\n\n\nWash your hands frequently\n\n\n\nRegularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.\n\n\n\nWhy? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.\n\n\n\nMaintain social distancing\n\n\n\nMaintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\n\n\n\nWhy? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.\n\n\n\nAvoid touching eyes, nose and mouth\n\n\n\nWhy? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.\n\n\n\nALSO READ: 15 Myths About COVID-19 You Must Not fall For\n\n\n\nPractice respiratory hygiene\n\n\n\nMake sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.
