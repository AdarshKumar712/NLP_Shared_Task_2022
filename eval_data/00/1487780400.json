San Francisco, San Jose, Irvine, and Fremont, California, all come in the top 10 best cities.\n\nWalletHub started by looking at the most popular resolutions and 182 U.S. cities to see which were keeping to their goals. They also considered 57 metrics that factored in resolutions related to health, finances, school/work, bad habits and relationships.\n\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n\nWallethub then looked at metrics including how many adults aren\u2019t exercising, income growth, unemployment rate, binge and heavy-drinking, and people who spend time and talk to family and friends.\n\nCalifornia cities fared well on average for these metrics. Fremont, Irvine, San Francisco and San Diego have the lowest percentage of obese adults. San Francisco also ranked third for highest median credit score, ranked second for most restaurants per capita and has among the lowest unemployment rates of all the cities WalletHub considered.\n\nSan Jose also came in first for lowest percentage of adult smokers.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["New Year's", "resolution", "California", "Wallethub", "best", "worst", "cities", "popular", "lose weight", "gym"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "WalleHub has released a study with the best and worst cities for keeping New Year\u2019s resolutions.
