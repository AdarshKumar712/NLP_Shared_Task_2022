In case of DMD patients in the United States , the diagnosed prevalent cases were 16,840 in 2017.\n\n, the diagnosed prevalent cases were 16,840 in 2017. The total diagnosed prevalent cases of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients were found to be maximum in the age-group 8-13 year and 14-19 year in the United States , which was 4,757 and 4,714 respectively in 2017.\n\n, which was 4,757 and 4,714 respectively in 2017. In EU5 countries the diagnosed prevalence was found to be 27,685 in 2017 which is expected to rise in the forecast period 2020-2030.\n\nScope of the Report\n\nThe report covers the descriptive overview of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), explaining its causes, signs and symptoms, pathophysiology.\n\nThe report provides insight into the 7MM historical and forecasted patient pool covering the United States , EU5 countries ( Germany , France , Italy , Spain , and United Kingdom ) and Japan .\n\n, EU5 countries ( , , , , and ) and . The report assesses the disease risk and burden and highlights the unmet needs of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).\n\nThe report provides the segmentation of the disease epidemiology for 7MM by Total Prevalent Cases of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Total Diagnosed and Treated Cases of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).\n\nReport Highlights\n\nEleven Year Forecast of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)\n\n7MM Coverage\n\nDiagnosed Prevalent Population of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy\n\nAge-specific Diagnosed Prevalence of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Different age groups have been considered to develop the forecast model such as 2-7, 8-13, 20-25 and >25. Out of which the highest diagnosed prevalent age group was 8-13 years old.\n\nReport also covers Mutation-specific Diagnosed Prevalence of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, including several mutations such as Large Mutations, Small Mutations and Point Mutations with major proportion for deletions in Large Mutations subgroup.\n\nDiagnosed Prevalence of Associated Comorbidities in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The publisher has also estimated ocuurence of associated comorbidities due to DMD, which include Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Cardiomyopathy and others.\n\nKey Questions Answered\n\nWhat is the disease risk, burden and unmet needs of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)?\n\nWhat is the historical Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patient pool in the United States , EU5 ( Germany , France , Italy , Spain , and the UK) and Japan ?\n\n, EU5 ( , , , , and the UK) and ?
