The Russian Health Ministry on Tuesday said it has introduced methods of urgent post-contact prevention against the novel coronavirus infection for medical personnel to be taken in case biological liquids get on the skin or mucous membranes.\n\n\"Protecting medical personnel is a duty and high priority of all managers of health service establishments.
