So, likewise when you shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the door.\u201d Also remember that when Jesus was hungry and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, for the time of the figs was not yet, he answered and said to the tree, \u201cNo man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever.\u201d The next morning, the fig tree was dried up from the root.\u201d\n\n[Matthew 24: 32-35, Mark 11: 12- 21]\n\n\n\nThe fig tree represents Israel and the nations of the world that bear only leaves and no fruit. The leaves are symbolic of God given gifts which are received without repentance. However, one must repent in order to receive the fruits of the Spirit which are love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance.\n\n[I Corinthians 12: 8-10, Galatians 5: 22-23]\n\n\n\nWhen I was in Israel in 2017, I too stood upon the Mount of Olives. I also observed Israel to be a rocky mountain country. However, it was an amazing sight to see the land bearing much natural crops and fruits. Israel had been dried up, burned up in the holocaust, and scattered all over the world, but God reversed the curse and Israel became a nation again in 1948. Yes, the fig tree is blooming again. Many leaves on the trees of many nations are about to blossom and bring forth fruit because the true word of God is now watering the roots of the dried up trees. As corona virus sweeps over the world, many people will return to God. But sad to say, that many will continue in their same old ways; disrespecting our Lord and Savior, our maker and creator of all things. [Matthew 24: 36, Revelation 9: 20- 21, 11: 15-19, 21: 8-10]\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t know the day or the hour of Jesus\u2019 return, but he surely did give us signs and he told us that we would definitely know the season of his return. Look up saints for our redemption draws nigh! [I Thessalonians 5: 1-11, Luke 21: 28]\n\n\n\n\u2014 Savannah Herald\n\n\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["The Gospel Truth With Gwendolyn Greene"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/clients/bl-s18215/favicon2.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "The Gospel Truth With Gwendolyn Greene", "og": {"image": "http://savannahherald.net/clients/savannahherald/4-28-2020-12-24-30-PM-2858026.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Gospel Truth With Gwendolyn Greene", "image": "http://savannahherald.net/clients/savannahherald/4-28-2020-12-24-30-PM-2858026.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "canonical_link": ""}
