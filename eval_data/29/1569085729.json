Six percent are children under 12. There are nine cases of people over 80.\n\nTo date 22 patients in serious condition have been reported: 8% of confirmed cases. In other countries, he said, this indicator stands at around 20%. In Cuba, only 5% of cases have developed critical conditions.\n\nHe also disclosed that 50% of seriously ill patients are over 60 years old, and that 36.4% are between 40 and 60 years old. Eighty percent are men. In all cases, he said, their serious condition has been linked to pre-existing chronic diseases.\n\nThe latest report records that there are six critically ill and two patients in serious condition, attended by highly experienced staff, he added. All the provinces, except Mayabeque and the Isla de la Juventud Special Municipality, have confirmed cases. According to what he said, until now the most affected territories are Havana (73 cases), Villa Clara (32), Matanzas (23), Ciego de \u00c1vila (23), Pinar del R\u00edo (21), Santiago de Cuba (21), Sancti Sp\u00edritus (16) and Camag\u00fcey (16).\n\nHe stressed that those diagnosed are mostly Cuban (237 vs. 32 foreigners). Of the total of sick Cubans, 102 (43.2%) were infected abroad, mainly in the United States (35), Spain (25) and Mexico (13), in addition to Panama, Guyana, France and other nations. \u201cThose persons came from abroad and developed the disease,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the other hand, 135 Cubans were infected within the island. Forty-two percent became ill from contacts with foreigners and Cubans who came from abroad, while 48% had interactions with Cuban and foreign travelers during the fourteen days of incubation. The 8.8%, he said, corresponds to secondary events of local transmission in Matanzas and Pinar del R\u00edo.\n\nRegarding the situation in the El Carmelo People\u2019s Council, in El Vedado, he said that it was \u201can area where there are 238 rental houses and a large influx of tourists and people, so it is essential to take the isolation measure to avoid an important transmission and protect not only the province, but the country.\u201d In addition to the eight confirmed cases, there are 18 contacts currently under surveillance. In that area, 30.8% of the population is over 60 years old.\n\nFinally, he said that the safe-conduct announced yesterday as a requirement to enter or leave the area will not be applied. \u201cThis is not a quarantine,\u201d he said, but an increase in isolation to protect the population. \u201cResidents should stay in their homes, and only leave if it is essential or if they have important work commitments. The population that does not live in that area should refrain from visiting.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let your guard down for a single minute,\u201d he said. \u201cThe population must understand that we are protecting their health,\u201d he concluded.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["cuban society", "coronavirus in Cuba"], "authors": ["Oncuba Staff"], "publish_date": "Sat Apr  4 22:43:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "This was said at the Mesa Redonda television program by Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Portal Miranda, who offered statistics and information to characterize COVID-19 on the island.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://oncubanews.com/en/wp-content/themes/oncubanews-child/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "theme-color": "#00a7e4", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#00a7e4", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "#00a7e4", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Cuban Minister of Health: \u201cYou can\u2019t let your guard down for a single minute\u201d | OnCubaNews English", "site_name": "OnCubaNews English", "description": "This was said at the Mesa Redonda television program by Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Portal Miranda, who offered statistics and information to characterize COVID-19 on the island.", "url": "https://oncubanews.com/en/cuba/cuban-minister-of-health-you-cant-let-your-guard-down-for-a-single-minute/", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/oncubanews.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fotos-de-la-habana-en-tipos-de-coroanvirus-5-1.jpg?fit=750%2C536&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/oncubanews.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fotos-de-la-habana-en-tipos-de-coroanvirus-5-1.jpg?fit=750%2C536&ssl=1", "width": 750, "height": 536}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-04-04T22:43:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2020-04-04T22:43:00+00:00", "section": "Cuba", "tag": "cuban society"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cuban Minister of Health: \u201cYou can\u2019t let your guard down for a single minute\u201d | OnCubaNews English", "description": "This was said at the Mesa Redonda television program by Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Portal Miranda, who offered statistics and information to characterize COVID-19 on the island.", "url": "https://oncubanews.com/en/cuba/cuban-minister-of-health-you-cant-let-your-guard-down-for-a-single-minute/", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/oncubanews.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fotos-de-la-habana-en-tipos-de-coroanvirus-5-1.jpg?fit=750%2C536&ssl=1"}, "description": "This was said at the Mesa Redonda television program by Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Portal Miranda, who offered statistics and information to characterize COVID-19 on the island.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"pages": 287207208102085}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://oncubanews.com/en/cuba/cuban-minister-of-health-you-cant-let-your-guard-down-for-a-single-minute/?ia_markup=1"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/oncubanews.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/isotipo.jpg?fit=250%2C250&ssl=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://oncubanews.com/en/cuba/cuban-minister-of-health-you-cant-let-your-guard-down-for-a-single-minute/"}
