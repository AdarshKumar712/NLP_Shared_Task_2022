In addition, Levy heads up Ascend Long Island, a pilot program that supports underserved communities in Nassau County.\n\nLevy said that \u201c$1,200 doesn\u2019t go nearly as far in Hempstead as it does in Huntsville, Alabama. The help is not going to go as far here as it will in other parts of the country.\u201d It\u2019s disappointing, he said, as \u201cthe federal government does recognize\u201d the cost of living difference in how it pays its employees based on where they live.\n\nThe $1,200 per taxpayer is \u201cpunishing to the higher costs suburbs all around the country,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, to access that money, most people don\u2019t need to do anything. But some, including senior citizens and low-income people who might not traditionally file tax returns, are advised to take action. People behind on filing their taxes might also want to get caught up.\n\nEligibility\n\nAnyone earning up to $75,000 in adjusted gross income and who has a Social Security number will receive a $1,200 payment. That means married couples filing joint returns will receive the full payment \u2014 $2,400 \u2014 if their adjusted gross income, which is what you report on your taxes, is under $150,000.\n\nThe payment steadily declines for those who make more. Those earning more than $99,000, or $198,000 for joint filers, are not eligible. The thresholds are slightly different for those who file as a head of household.\n\nParents will also receive $500 for each qualifying child.\n\nAccessing funds\n\nMost people don\u2019t have to do anything to access the funds.\n\nThe money will be directly deposited in your bank account if the government has that information from your tax return. If you haven\u2019t filed your 2019 taxes, the government will use information from your 2018 taxes to calculate your payment and determine where to send it. It can use your Social Security benefit statement as well.\n\nIf you don\u2019t usually have to file taxes\n\nPeople who are not required to file a tax return \u2014 such as low-income tax payers, some senior citizens, Social Security recipients, some veterans and people with disabilities \u2014 will need to file a very simplified tax return to receive the economic impact payment. It provides the government basic details including a person\u2019s filing status, number of dependents and direct-deposit bank information.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t yet file 2018 or 2019 taxes\n\nYou will still get a payment, but the IRS urges anyone required to file a tax return and has not yet done so for those years to file as soon as possible in order to receive an economic impact payment. Taxpayers should include their direct-deposit banking information on the return if they want it deposited in their account.\n\nIf you don\u2019t use direct deposit on your taxes\n\nThe government will default to sending you the check by mail if you did not use direct deposit.\n\nHowever, IRS and Treasury say that they will develop an online portal in the coming weeks for individuals to provide their banking information so that they can receive the payments immediately instead of in the mail. It has not yet set a deadline for updating that information.\n\nLearning more about the check\n\nThe IRS and Treasury say the website irs.gov/coronavirus will soon provide information about the check, including how people can file a simple 2019 tax return.\n\nWhen you need more time to file your tax returns\n\nThe IRS says people concerned about visiting a tax professional or local community organization in person to get help with a tax return should not worry. The economic impact payments will be available throughout the rest of 2020.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["COVID-19"], "authors": ["Adina Genn"], "publish_date": "Mon Apr  6 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "How to access payments, and what the money means to the region.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://libn.com/files/2014/03/libn57.png", "meta_data": {"description": "How to access payments, and what the money means to the region.", "og": {"title": "Where\u2019s my $1,200?", "type": "article", "url": "https://libn.com/2020/04/06/wheres-my-1200/", "image": "https://libn.com/files/2020/04/LG-Depositphotos_165381128_xl-2015-e1586186976499-1024x545.jpeg", "site_name": "Long Island Business News"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-04-06T11:32:17Z", "modified_time": "2020-04-06T14:40:16Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Where\u2019s my $1,200?", "image": "https://libn.com/files/2020/04/LG-Depositphotos_165381128_xl-2015-e1586186976499-1024x545.jpeg"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Where\u2019s my $1,200?", "thumbnail": "https://libn.com/files/2020/04/LG-Depositphotos_165381128_xl-2015-e1586186976499-180x120.jpeg", "google-site-verification": "prJM0F6_hLVnSjClKqHN9f0yCvgWPpfGJpTRzyS7lpo", "y_key": "3dbc4b23a8d3ae0b", "msvalidate.01": "3999BB2D894623F4AF6815FACA6133D9", "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Adina Genn", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://libn.com/2020/04/06/wheres-my-1200/"}
