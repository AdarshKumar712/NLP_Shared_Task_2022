To assess potential selection bias, socio-demographic information will also be collected from people who decline to participate in the study.\n\nAll of the children and adults who participate will undergo a rapid immuno-chromatography test to determine whether they have antibodies in their blood.\n\nThe test being used is the 'Orient Gene Covis 19 IgM/IgG', from Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech, with CE marking which uses colloidal gold immuno-chromatography in point-of-care format, in blood, serum/plasma samples, detects both IgM and IgG, and the results will be known within 10 minutes.\n\nThe working document states that there are two reliability studies with this test that show sensitivity figures greater than 80% and specificity close to 99% in serum and blood whether obtained by venipuncture or digital puncture.\n\nA serum antibody measurement test will also be carried out by Healthcare Personnel on participants who agree to give a blood sample. Quantification of serum IgG antibodies will be carried out by means of an enzyme immuno-adsorption assay, (the selection and removal of specific antibodies and immune complexes.)\n\nEpidemiological Survey\n\nEach selected home and each participant will be asked to complete an epidemiological questionnaire in order to document any previous diagnosis of Covid-19, or the presence or history of any symptoms.\n\nIn this way, the participants will be classed as negative, asymptomatic or possible past or present Covid-19.\n\nEach participant will be asked for permission to access their medical history, so that in the second phase the data of those selected in the sample can be incorporated into the study.\n\nThe epidemiological questionnaire will be completed online to make the process faster and easier and the information will be collected on a central database along with the data from the rapid tests to allow instantaneous monitoring of all information.\n\nThe National Epidemiology Centre will carry out the analysis with the support of the INE, to help field teams monitor control measures in homes.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that in the first round of fieldwork it will take 2 weeks to collect all the information from 36,000 households in 1,500 census sections.\n\nTo guarantee that the census sections are equally represented in both weeks, 12 households from each section will be randomly selected to be analysed during the first week, which will constitute Cohort A (18,000 households), and the remaining 12 households from each section will be analysed in the second week, constituting Cohort B (18,000 households).\n\nIt is estimated that at least three rounds of follow-up, separated by one week, will be necessary to solve possible logistical problems and process all of the information.\n\nCohort A will always be visited in the first week of each round and Cohort B in the second week.\n\nHow You Are Invited To Participate\n\nParticipants will be contacted by \u2018phone. If a home has more than one phone and the call is not answered, the following number and successive numbers will be used to maximise the possibility of contact. If no response is obtained to any of the numbers, the operation will be repeated a minimum of 5 times at different times of the day and if none of them are successful, the address will be classified as unreachable.\n\nIn the following waves of the study, the attempt to locate these addresses that continue to be part of the sample universe of the study will be repeated and included in the corresponding wave as long as they agree to participate.\n\nOnce telephone contact has been established, the participants will be advised of the objective and characteristics of the study and asked if they're willing to participate. Once the information and characteristics about everyone living at the address has been obtained an interview appointment will be set up.\n\nInformation will also be collected about household members who need a certificate to justify absence from work to take part in the study.\n\nThe results of the seroprevalence study will be known at the end of next week.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Mallorca Coronavirus", "Mallorca State of Emergency", "Nationwide seroprevalence study", "Balearics"], "tags": ["Nationwide seroprevalence study", "Mallorca State of Emergency", "Mallorca Coronavirus"], "authors": ["Majorca Daily Bulletin Reporter"], "publish_date": "Wed Apr 22 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "90,000 to take part in nationwide seroprevalence study.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://md.gsstatic.es/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"title": "2,460 from the Balearics to take part in nationwide study", "description": "90,000 to take part in nationwide seroprevalence study.", "keywords": "Mallorca Coronavirus,Mallorca State of Emergency,Nationwide seroprevalence study,Balearics", "twitter": {"site": "@MajorcaDaily", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/sfAttachPlugin/33933.jpg", "url": "https://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/news/local/2020/04/22/65931/460-from-the-balearics-take-part-nationwide-study.html", "title": "90,000 people to take part in nationwide study", "description": "90,000 to take part in nationwide seroprevalence study."}, "dc.date.issued": "2020-04-22", "robots": "index, follow", "language": "en", "google-site-verification": "b7bcEjZ1VQU0vfnGK_vTCJxaJQFHALgLWjnS-kLid9c", "og": {"site_name": "Majorca Daily Bulletin", "title": "90,000 people to take part in nationwide study", "url": "https://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/news/local/2020/04/22/65931/460-from-the-balearics-take-part-nationwide-study.html", "type": "article", "description": "90,000 to take part in nationwide seroprevalence study.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/sfAttachPlugin/33933.jpg", "width": 1134, "height": 660}}, "fb": {"pages": 300611123394179, "admins": 1009840697, "app_id": 205112354354}, "article": {"tag": "Nationwide seroprevalence study", "section": "Balearics", "published_time": "2020-04-22T15:24:00+02:00", "modified_time": "2020-06-09T16:32:41+02:00"}, "viewport": "user-scalable=1, width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "X-GS-Origin": "web04"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/news/local/2020/04/22/65931/460-from-the-balearics-take-part-nationwide-study.html"}
