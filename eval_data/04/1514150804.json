Mitt Romney (R-UT) voted yes on the first charge, but the final vote was 52-48.\n\nThe Senate voted on party lines on the second charge, 53-47.\n\nTrump simply held up The Washington Post with the headling \u201cTrump Acquitted.\u201d\n\nTrump reminded the world that the Democrats have openly targeted him before his 2017 inauguration.\n\nFrom Fox News:\n\nGreeted by thunderous applause and a standing ovation by his supporters, the president declared \u201cwe went through hell\u201d but described the moment as a \u201ccelebration\u201d \u2014 while maintaining as he did throughout the impeachment inquiry and trial that he \u201cdid nothing wrong.\u201d And on a day when he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were trading shots in deeply personal terms, Trump turned fire on those who prosecuted the case and other investigations against him. He called Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201cvicious\u201d people. \u201cIt was evil. It was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars. This should never, ever happen to another president, ever,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was a disgrace.\u201d He detailed the timeline of investigations, remarking of the Russia probe: \u201cIt was all bulls\u2014.\u201d As he did earlier Thursday at a prayer breakfast, Trump brandished a copy of Thursday\u2019s Washington Post with a blaring headline: \u201cTrump acquitted.\u201d\n\nTrump joked that he may frame The Washington Post paper with the headline because it\u2019s the \u201conly good headline\u201d the paper has ever given him.\n\nWould it shock anyone if he did frame it? I bet he does. I think he should!\n\nDonations tax deductible\n\nto the full extent allowed by law.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["trump impeachment", "trump speech"], "tags": ["Trump Speech", "Trump Impeachment"], "authors": ["Mary Chastain", "Paul In Sweden", "Another Voice", "Close The Fed", "The Friendly Grizzly", "Cdr D"], "publish_date": "Thu Feb  6 17:00:16 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Senate acquitted him on two charges.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://c4.legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New-Favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "description": "The Senate acquitted him on two charges.", "keywords": "trump impeachment,trump speech", "og": {"site_name": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion", "type": "article", "title": "Trump Takes Victory Lap at White House Event", "description": "The Senate acquitted him on two charges.", "url": "https://legalinsurrection.com/2020/02/live-trump-making-public-statement-to-discuss-our-countrys-victory-on-the-impeachment-hoax/", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2020-02-06T13:16:33-05:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Trump-Impeachment-Press-Conference-Acquitted-Headline-WaPo-4-e1581011094468.jpg", "url": "https://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Trump-Impeachment-Press-Conference-Acquitted-Headline-WaPo-4-e1581011094468.jpg", "secure_url": "https://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Trump-Impeachment-Press-Conference-Acquitted-Headline-WaPo-4-e1581011094468.jpg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-06T12:00:16-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-06T13:16:33-05:00", "tag": "Trump Speech", "section": "Uncategorized"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "domain": "legalinsurrection.com", "title": "Trump Takes Victory Lap at White House Event", "description": "The Senate acquitted him on two charges."}, "google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 6.2.23 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface."}, "canonical_link": "https://legalinsurrection.com/2020/02/live-trump-making-public-statement-to-discuss-our-countrys-victory-on-the-impeachment-hoax/"}
