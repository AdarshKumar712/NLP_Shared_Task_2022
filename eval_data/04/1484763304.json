When I posted the tea & idli video, u/wromit suggested that I should try \"tandoori leg\" with tea. I couldn't find a leg piece, but I found what they call \u201cTikka.\u201d At first, I wasn't too sure about it, but after I tried it, I'm really digging the flavor. The after-taste was decent\u201d\n\nIn the 25 seconds long video clip the user can be seen pouring a cup of tea over a bowl full of chunks of chicken tikka. After the bowl is filled with tea, she mixes chicken and tea and eats the mix.\n\nIt is not surprising that this combination did not go down very well with netizens, as a result most of the comments on the post are negative in nature. Some users commented on the absurdity of the combination, while some called this act disturbing.\n\nA user, who goes by the name DrAj111199991 on Reddit commented, \u201cWhy do you keep terrorising us like so? Who has paid you? ISI? How can they tolerate this either? Why you do this to me?\u201d\n\nAnother user which goes by the name RevengeOfPorolok on the portal wrote, \u201cPoor chicken, got butchered twice.\u201d\n\nGet the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.
