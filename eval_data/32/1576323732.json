A hero for as long as I can remember, and \u2013on a few golden occasions \u2013 a colleague and collaborator on I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue.

So sad \u2014 Stephen Fry (@stephenfry) April 12, 2020\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGarden, his Goodies co-star, was among the first to pay tribute to his friend and fellow performer.\n\nHe said: \"I am terribly saddened by the loss of a dear colleague and close friend of over 50 years.\n\n\"Tim and I met at Cambridge University in the early 1960s and have enjoyed working together almost constantly from that time onwards, on radio, stage, and TV.\n\n\"He was a funny, sociable, generous man who was a delight to work with. Audiences found him not only hilarious but also adorable.\n\n\"His loss at this dreadful time is particularly hard to bear, and my thoughts are with Christine, Ben, Edward and their families.\"\n\nHe was joined by the likes of Stephen Fry, Jack Dee, Rob Brydon and David Walliams in paying their respects.\n\n\u201cI was obsessed with \u2018The Goodies\u2019 as a child, the first comedy show I really loved,\u201d Walliams wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI queued up to get the Goodies\u2019 autographs as a grown-up, and got to meet Tim Brooke-Taylor more recently at a party. I was in total awe, but he was so kind & generous. It is so sad he is gone.\u201d\n\nI was obsessed with \u2018The Goodies\u2019 as a child, the first comedy show I really loved.
