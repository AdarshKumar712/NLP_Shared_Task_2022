Airbus\n\nThese measures are likely to affect Airbus\u2019 output of A320 family aircraft. The aircraft manufacturer only recently increased the output of its 2008-opened Tianjin FAL, which is one of four sites in the world building the A320, from four to six aircraft per month. Airbus\u2019 objective was to increase the total production of A320s from all its global assembly lines to 63 per month in 2021.\n\nOther final assembly lines for the aircraft family are located in Hamburg (Germany), Toulouse (France) and Mobile (Alabama, United States). Hamburg is currently building the largest share of A320 family aircraft.\n\nFurthermore, Airbus operates a \u2018completion and delivery center\u2019 (C&DC) for the A330 at its Tianjin facility, which is planned to extend its capabilities onto the A350 family.\n\nThe site in China, including the A320 FAL, is a joint venture between the European company and a consortium consisting of Tianjin Free Trade Zone and China Aviation Industry Corporation.\n\nTravel restrictions resulting from the Coronavirus are also posing \u2018some logistical challenges\u2019, Airbus says in its statement.\n\nOver the past days and weeks, more and more airlines and countries had decided to suspend flights to mainland China over fears that the virus could spread.\n\nAirbus is expected to publish further updates on the situation and its response.\n\nJakob Wert is an aviation journalist from Germany.
