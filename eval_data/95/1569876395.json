This latest incident shows the brazenness of criminals in the area. It seems to me that persons might be using the current health crisis as a way of doing their dirty deeds,\u201d he said.\n\nHe believes that members of the business community are being targeted by criminals.\n\n\u201cDuring this time persons are asked to stay home, but the criminal elements are using that as an opportunity to go to people's homes and business places and take advantage of the situation. There was another murder last week and robberies as well,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2014 Kasey Williams", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["General NewsInternationalLocal NewsToday's Headlines"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jamaica Observer Limited"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "MANDEVILLE, Manchester \u2014 The police have released the identity of a man who was sho...", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"alexaVerifyID": "rSmiGOPEjbvIe54g6VDdjp7fxDQ", "google-site-verification": "yGWL0JARPWTYZuQO6SyybESnW5Tn5sn_mj5vRQhwZq8", "y_key": "b1206159d404874b", "msvalidate.01": "F356DE1E2BCA8CFA747B5120592BE455", "description": "MANDEVILLE, Manchester \u2014 The police have released the identity of a man who was sho...", "keywords": "General NewsInternationalLocal NewsToday's Headlines", "og": {"title": "Two hospitalised, one dead in Manchester gun attack", "site_name": "Jamaica Observer", "image": "http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/JO/20200406/ARTICLE/304069938/AR/0/AR-304069938.jpg"}, "revisit-after": "1 days", "Author": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "DC.Subject": "Jamaica, Observer", "DC.Title": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "ROBOTS": "Follow,Index", "rating": "GENERAL", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@JamaicaObserver", "creator": "@JamaicaObserver", "title": "Two hospitalised, one dead in Manchester gun attack", "description": "MANDEVILLE, Manchester \u2014 The police have released the identity of a man who was sho...", "image": "http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/JO/20200406/ARTICLE/304069938/AR/0/AR-304069938.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": ""}
