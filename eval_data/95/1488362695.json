One of Epstein\u2019s alleged victims, Virginia Giuffre, has accused Maxwell of recruiting her to have sex with him when she was a minor. Maxwell denied the allegations.\n\nEpstein, the Jewish millionaire financier facing sex trafficking charges for allegedly abusing dozens of minor girls, hanged himself in his New York City jail cell in August, law enforcement officials said. Though New York City\u2019s chief medical examiner ruled his death a suicide, a forensic pathologist hired by his family said the autopsy pointed to homicide.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Pandemic Times", "More in Hollywood", "More in Podcasts", "Hollywood", "More in Culture"], "authors": ["Josefin Dolsten"], "publish_date": "Mon Jan  6 22:05:58 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "(JTA) \u2014 Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite who has been accused of helping late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is reportedly hiding out in Israel.
