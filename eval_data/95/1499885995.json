The interim president traveled to the city of Bogot\u00e1 to hold an important meeting with President Iv\u00e1n Duque at the Casa de Nari\u00f1o. Juan Guaid\u00f3 was received with all the honors at the hemispheric Summit to fight terrorism. He is expected to meet with the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo.\n\nAfter the meeting with the president of Colombia, Guaid\u00f3 stressed that the meeting was part of the international agenda to consolidate the world\u2019s support to achieve the freedom of Venezuela. The meeting was attended by Vice President Martha Luc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, Foreign Minister Claudia Blumy and Chief of Staff Mar\u00eda Paula Correa. The Latin American leaders discussed the growing number of migrants in Colombia and stressed the importance of restoring democracy in Venezuela.\n\nDeputy Carlos Paparoni also reported that in Bogot\u00e1 they are meeting with the United States, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saint Lucia, El Salvador and Ecuador. They will discuss the threat posed by the operation of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah in Venezuela and the rest of the region. The Venezuelan representation will present evidence of the links of terrorism with the Maduro regime. The conference attendees will work to develop cooperation strategies and mechanisms to continue taking action against those who protect and finance them today.\n\nTRENDING: At Least One Third of the Nation Believes Joe Biden Stole the Election - Unchanged from December\n\nAfter leaving the meeting, Guaid\u00f3 expressed his gratitude to Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque for his support, and assured that his return to Venezuela will be full of good news.\n\nIt is important to note that for about a year the Venezuelan Supreme Court of Justice prohibited the opposition leader Guaid\u00f3 from leaving the country. The Maduro regime used this to persecute and intimidate the president in charge. However, this prohibition has not been an obstacle to limit the actions of courageous Guaid\u00f3 in its purpose of recovering democracy in Venezuela.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Elda Primera", "Elda Is A Venezuelan Journalist In Exile.
