Declarer overruffed, led a diamond to the king and returned the jack of trumps to finesse. West produced the king and exited with a trump.\n\n\u201cI drew trumps,\u201d South told me, \u201cand took the ace, queen and king of clubs, hoping for a 3-3 break. When West discarded, I tried a diamond finesse with the jack, but West had the queen. My wife said I had booted the contract. I had no idea what she was talking about, but I nodded like I always do.\u201d\n\nDid South do anything terrible?\n\nAfter South draws trumps, he should cash his last trump, pitching a diamond from dummy. He next takes the three top clubs. With two tricks to go, dummy has a low diamond and a low club, and declarer has the A-J of diamonds.\n\nWhen dummy leads a diamond at the 12th trick and East follows with the ten, South knows his last card is the jack of clubs, so a diamond finesse can\u2019t win. So South puts up the ace \u2014 and makes his game when the queen falls from West.\n\nSouth dealer\n\nBoth sides vulnerable\n\nNORTH\n\nS Q 8 3\n\nH J 10 7\n\nD K 8 5\n\nC K 8 6 2\n\nWEST\n\nS A K J 5 4 2\n\nH K 5 2\n\nD Q 6\n\nC 4 3\n\nEAST\n\nS 10 7\n\nH 4 3\n\nD 10 9 4 3 2\n\nC J 10 9 5\n\nSOUTH\n\nS 9 6\n\nH A Q 9 8 6\n\nD A J 7\n\nC A Q 7\n\nSouth West North East\n\n1 H 1 S 2 H Pass\n\n4 H All Pass\n\nOpening lead \u2014 S K\n\n(C)2020 Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Bridge"], "authors": ["Frank Stewart"], "publish_date": "Sun Jan 19 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/32x32-mercury-news-white.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"application-name": "themercurynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "wp-parsely_version": "1.14", "fb": {"pages": 63095136336}, "google-site-verification": "jvnaFa4kq5tUDhFMQZ84bDI74A2qnu0gfhxZjZXlkko", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Bridge: Jan. 19, 2020", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/bridge-jan-19-2020", "description": "\u201cI\u2019ve had to agree with my wife so much,\u201d a player at the club told me ruefully, \u201cthat now when I hear the sound of her voice, I just instinctively start to nod.\u201d In a\u2026", "site_name": "The Mercury News", "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/themes/mercurynews/static/images/mercurynews.jpg", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-19T11:00:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-15T21:47:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@mercnews", "text": {"title": "Bridge: Jan. 19, 2020"}, "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/themes/mercurynews/static/images/mercurynews.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/32x32-mercury-news-white.png?w=32"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.mercurynews.com/bridge-jan-19-2020"}
