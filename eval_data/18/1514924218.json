That is a reason to begin the dialogue between the institutions as soon as possible.\"\n\nAmid a storm of criticism from opposition parties, S\u00e1nchez defended the need to sit down and break up a ten year process that had had \"lamentable results\". However there was surprise as the agenda items for the forthcoming meetings aren't as controversial as some feared in terms of separatist demands.\n\nWhile Torra has agreed to the content of the discussions for now, he lamented that he still didn't know Madrid's real position on the Catalan independence issue. \"We're only asking to get to the root, which is sovereignty,\" he said. \" How much democracy is the Spanish state ready to take on board?\"\n\nTorra may soon be removed as president if an appeal to a case goes against him and Catalan elections are expected as his ruling coalition of JxCat and ERC has broken down.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["sanchez", "meets", "catalan", "leader", "torra", "both", "agree", "start", "joint", "dialogue", "this", "month"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Feb  7 10:34:51 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.surinenglish.com/img/2014/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"Description": "Although no date is as yet fixed, prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Quim Torra, regional president of Catalonia, agreed on Thursday to start formal roundtable meetings between the", "news_keywords": "sanchez, meets, catalan, leader, torra, both, agree, start, joint, dialogue, this, month", "keywords": "sanchez, meets, catalan, leader, torra, both, agree, start, joint, dialogue, this, month", "date": "2020-02-07T11:34:51+0100", "DC.date.issued": "2020-02-07", "robots": "index,follow", "og": {"url": "http://www.surinenglish.com/national/202002/07/sanchez-meets-catalan-leader-20200207101236-v.html", "title": "PM S\u00e1nchez meets Catalan leader Torra and both agree to start joint dialogue this month", "type": "article", "description": "Although no date is as yet fixed, prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Quim Torra, regional president of Catalonia, agreed on Thursday to start formal roundtable meetings between the", "locale": "es_ES", "image": "http://www.surinenglish.com/noticias/202002/07/media/cortadas/147015727--575x383.jpg", "site_name": "surinenglish.com"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.surinenglish.com/national/202002/07/sanchez-meets-catalan-leader-20200207101236-v.html", "site": "@SUR_English", "creator": "@SUR_English", "title": "PM S\u00e1nchez meets Catalan leader Torra and both agree to start joint dialogue this month", "description": "Although no date is as yet fixed, prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Quim Torra, regional president of Catalonia, agreed on Thursday to start formal roundtable meetings between the", "image": "http://www.surinenglish.com/noticias/202002/07/media/cortadas/147015727--575x383.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-07T10:34:51+0100", "modified_time": "2020-02-07T11:34:51+0100", "section": "national", "tag": "sanchez, meets, catalan, leader, torra, both, agree, start, joint, dialogue, this, month"}, "viewport": "width=1070", "platform": "desktop"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.surinenglish.com/national/202002/07/sanchez-meets-catalan-leader-20200207101236-v.html"}
