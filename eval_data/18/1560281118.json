We must learn that lesson,\" he said, in a statement that recalled \"the need to work on a common debt instrument issued by a European institution to raise funds on the market.\"\n\nBut northern countries led by Germany and the Netherlands were against what they see as efforts by their southern neighbours to push their long-standing demands for eurozone members to pool public debt.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said that support for corona bonds was not shared by all member states, while Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte gave a more blunt assessment.\n\n\"We are against it, but it's not just us, and I cannot forsee any circumstances in which we would change that position,\" Rutte said.\n\nRutte and Merkel both pointed to existing crisis tools such as the European Stability Mechanism as more suitable to the task.\n\nAt a videoconference last week, Conte suggested the creation of corona bonds to pool the debt of the 19 countries in the eurozone.\n\nFrance, Spain and Italy have long called for some kind of eurobond that would in effect allow joint borrowing by the 19 members of the euro single currency.\n\nThey say it could serve as the bedrock of a safer and more unified European economy and would become a globally respected asset on par with US Treasury bills.\n\nBut sceptics see the eurobond as an attempt by over-spending southerners to take advantage of the cheap borrowing rates enjoyed by Germany and other paragons of balanced budgets.\n\n'There for each other'\n\nMeanwhile, many millions of the bloc's citizens are holed up at home, during lockdowns imposed to help slow the pandemic that has killed more than 15,000 Europeans and crippled business.\n\nAs the global outbreak first took hold, member states privileged national responses by shutting borders, hoarding medical supplies and waving through major spending plans regardless of EU rules.\n\n\"When Europe really needed to be there for each other, too many initially looked out for themselves,\" European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said ahead of the talks.\n\n\"When Europe really needed an 'all for one' spirit, too many initially gave an 'only for me' response,\" she added, speaking at a sparsely attended session of the European Parliament.\n\nThe summit statement said measures should include building an emergency stock of medical equipment and easing inter-EU border closures.\n\nThe leaders also rubber stamped the suspension of EU deficit rules to allow countries to spend freely to fight the virus regardless of, in some cases, already yawning budget deficits.\n\nThe 27 leaders tasked EU officials to work on an \"exit strategy\" and recovery plan to help rebuild the economy after the havoc wrought by COVID-19 and the drastic measures taken to fight it. \u2014 AFP", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Vietnam News", "Politics", "Business", "Economy", "Society", "Life", "Sports", "Environment", "Your Say", "English Through the News",
