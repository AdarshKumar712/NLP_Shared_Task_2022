The city state has 200 confirmed cases of the virus and its trade-dependent economy is particularly vulnerable.\n\nSingapore Central Bank Says Local Markets Functioning \u2018Normally\u2019\n\nSingapore\u2019s President Halimah Yacob said the nation must consider tapping past reserves to help its people and businesses that are \"bleeding\u201d from the impact of the virus. The government is preparing a second wave of support measures after allocating S$6.4 billion ($4.5 billion) last month to aid the virus-hit economy.\n\nLee\u2019s post also came a day after Singapore released a crucial electoral boundaries report, setting the stage for an imminent announcement on the country\u2019s next election that\u2019s largely considered to be Prime Minister Lee\u2019s final run at office.\n\n\"I fully expect things to get more serious before they start getting better, \u201d according to the post. When the election will be held \"will depend on what will best see Singapore through this major crisis, \u201d he said. - Bloomberg", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Economy", "Singapore", "Covid-19 Watch", "economic fallout", "coronavirus", "2008 global financial crisis", "Lee Hsien Loong"], "tags": ["Economy", "Singapore", "Covid-19 Watch"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Mar 14 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "SINGAPORE: The economic fallout from the coronavirus could be more serious than the damage done by the 2008 global financial crisis for Singapore, according to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"ROBOTS": "index,follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "SINGAPORE: The economic fallout from the coronavirus could be more serious than the damage done by the 2008 global financial crisis for Singapore, according to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.", "keywords": "Economy,Singapore,Covid-19 Watch,economic fallout,coronavirus,2008 global financial crisis,Lee Hsien Loong", "cXenseParse": {"smg-keywords": "Lee Hsien Loong", "author": "The Star Online", "pageclass": "article", "smg-accesstype": "metered", "recs": {"publishtime": "2020-03-14T21:14:00+0800"}, "articleid": 232611, "smg-contenttype": "Article", "kicker_name": "Economy", "kicker_url": "/tag/economy", "is_print": "false"}, "pageType": "article", "url": "https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2020/03/14/virus-may-be-more-damaging-than-financial-crisis-singapores-pm-says", "datePublished": "2020-03-14 21:14:00", "dateModified": "2020-03-14 21:19:56", "inLanguage": "en", "cxenseRandom": "k80at2ketza0kuhg2wmb", "page_type": "Article", "content_type": "Article", "content_id": 232611, "content_title": "Virus may be more damaging than financial crisis, Singapore\u2019s PM says", "content_category": "Business/Business News", "content_author": "NA", "content_sp": "NA", "content_byline": "NA", "content_agency": "NA", "content_language": "English", "content_date": "2020-03-14", "content_tags": "Economy,Singapore,Covid-19 Watch,economic fallout,coronavirus,2008 global financial crisis,Lee Hsien Loong", "content_tier": "Metered", "content_length": "Short", "parsely-metadata": "{\"guid\": \"232611\", \"byline\": \"NA\", \"summary\": \"SINGAPORE: The economic fallout from the coronavirus could be more serious than the damage done by the 2008 global financial crisis for Singapore, according to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\", \"image_url\" :\"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/03/14/605220.jpg\",\"contain_video\": false,\"is_premium\": false,\"is_print\": false,\"access_type\": \"metered\" ,\"kicker_name\": \"Economy\",\"kicker_url\": \"/tag/economy\" }", "thumbnailUrl": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/03/14/605220.jpg", "article": {"modified_time": "2020-03-14T21:19:56.000Z", "published_time": "2020-03-14T21:14:00.000Z", "section": "Business"}, "fb": {"app_id": 121120175250633}, "og": {"url": "https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2020/03/14/virus-may-be-more-damaging-than-financial-crisis-singapores-pm-says", "title": "Virus may be more damaging than financial crisis, Singapore\u2019s PM says", "description": "SINGAPORE: The economic fallout from the coronavirus could be more serious than the damage done by the 2008 global financial crisis for Singapore, according to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "The Star Online", "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/03/14/605220.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Virus may be more damaging than financial crisis, Singapore\u2019s PM says", "description": "SINGAPORE: The economic fallout from the coronavirus could be more serious than the damage done by the 2008 global financial crisis for Singapore, according to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.", "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/03/14/605220.jpg"}, "article_section_name": "Business", "csrf-token": "HfXrwkMP5bkooBRI9Qp6u9SeEP7JiKzESmZ4m1M5", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=428184176"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2020/03/14/virus-may-be-more-damaging-than-financial-crisis-singapores-pm-says"}
