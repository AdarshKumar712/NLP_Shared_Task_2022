All issues have been resolved. The allocation is expected to be announced by tomorrow,\" a source said.District guardian ministers and sitting arrangement of ministers at cabinet meetings were finalised on Wednesday, they said.Ashok Chavan, Balasaheb Thorat, Vijay Wadettiwar and Nitin Raut from the Congress, Jayant Patil and Ajit Pawar from the NCP and Eknath Shinde from the Shiv Sena met Thackeray to discuss allocation of ministries.According to Congress sources, the party is upset that it was not given any of the ministries which have a bearing on rural areas, such as agriculture and cooperation.\"We can swap portfolios with other two parties. We are not demanding increase in the number of ministries,\" sources added.All three parties are facing disgruntlement of leaders who were not inducted in the cabinet.Among such MLAs are Congress's Sangram Thopte, whose supporters vandalised Pune Congress office on Tuesday, and NCP's Prakash Solanke.
