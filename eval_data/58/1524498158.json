In the north if it rains or does not rain it is the same, because we do not have drinking water, energy is interrupted for hours and our hospitals are devastated. In order to go to the doctor we have to travel 400 kilometers to the capital, because there are no professionals here, and better not to mention the Chaco Salte\u00f1o\", said the Franciscan.\n\n\"How long will we have to live like this?\" asked the priest, who continued: \"This area has the resources of hydrocarbons, agriculture and timber. We are abandoned and there is no investment in this area\".\n\nThe priest then turned to the authorities: \"This area was rich in the period before the privatizations, but you impoverished it, with the aggravating factor that we cannot move to another place, because here we have work, home or simply our roots and our family history\".\n\nDue to the floods and consequent floods recorded in different locations in the province of Salta, Caritas Argentina has put in place its immediate assistance mechanisms in the face of climatic emergencies and the volunteer teams are working directly with the affected families.
