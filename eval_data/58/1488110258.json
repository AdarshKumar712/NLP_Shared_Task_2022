Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second metropolis, recently witnessed the discovery of a major ancient site while building its metro. Today, government officials, archaeologists, and local residents clash over the solution to preserve the past while modernizing their city.\n\nThe Thessaloniki Metropolitan Railway (or Thessaloniki Metro) is an underground urban transport system under construction in Thessaloniki, the second-largest city in Greece, with a population of over one million people in its metropolitan area. The city is often described as Greece's northern capital and is listed to host the first driverless metro system in the country.\n\nConstruction began in June 2006 and was originally scheduled to end in October 2012, a symbolic date coinciding with the centennial of the city's liberation from Ottoman rule on October 26, 1912. In September 2018, the first Thessaloniki metro wagon was presented at the Thessaloniki International Fair. Following a recent announcement by current Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the subway is expected to open in April 2023.\n\nThe 11-year construction delay has become an object of online satire.\n\n\n\nThe \u2018Byzantine Pompeii\u2019 revealed\n\nA major archaeological site was found in 2013 at the location of the future Venizelos Metro Station. At a depth of 5.4 meters, the Roman avenue Decumanus Maximus (later also known as the Byzantine Middle Road) was unearthed, along with shops and houses along the ancient Via Egnatia. A treasure trove of 750 jewels and more than 2,700 burial artifacts were also discovered in other metro stations currently under construction, all testifying to the heritage of Hellenistic and Roman times. International archaeological circles have since characterized the discovery as \u201cByzantine Pompeii,\u201d as can be seen in this video:\n\nThe government wants to move the antiquities\n\nFollowing the discovery of the antiquities in 2013, the then New Democracy Deputy Minister of Culture Costas Tzavaras ordered their removal from the site in order to continue the metro construction work. Yet this plan was initially stopped following strong opposition from archaeologists and residents. Then Thessaloniki Mayor Yiannis Boutaris successfully appealed the suspension and annulment of Tzavaras\u2019 decision.\n\nAfter the 2019 parliamentary electoral win of the New Democracy party, the issue of what to do with the antiquities at Venizelos station resurfaced. Following a meeting with the prime minister, the Central Macedonia Regional Governor Apostolos Tzitzikostas said:\n\n\u038c\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2, \u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03af\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b4\u03cc\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5 \u03bb\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03ae \u03c9\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u039a\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b8\u03ad\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03be\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc. \u039d\u03b1 \u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03b4\u03ae \u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 \u2013 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf, \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03b8\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd, \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03c9\u03b8\u03b5\u03af \u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u03c4\u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd.\n\nRegarding the Thessaloniki subway, especially after the revelations of the contractor, we \u2013 as Region of Central Macedonia \u2013 proposed solutions from the very beginning, and we insist on this opinion, that antiquities and subway should coexist. That is, to make a subway station-museum. But to do so, the antiquities must be detached, the subway station construction works completed, and then the antiquities repositioned.\n\nThe Minister of Culture Lina Mendoni reacted by saying during a press conference that her office and the Ministry of Infrastructure had not reached a decision yet and that \u201cwhen the time comes, they would deal with it.\u201d\n\nTo add to the confusion, the current Mayor of Thessaloniki Konstantinos Zervas and local officials have stated they are in favor of the removal and repositioning of the antiquities.\n\nOne of the main reasons for such opposite views is that keeping the ruins would require to scrap the central subway station, which could jeopardize a 3.5 billion-euro project co-financed by the European Union. This at a time when Greece's moribund economy sees very few major public projects.\n\nOutrage among the public and the scientific community\n\nOpposition politicians, archaeologists, and citizens have been outraged by the Greek government's plans to displace the delicate antiquities.\n\nStudents of the Department of History and Archaeology of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki are opposed to the government's decision. Additionally, the Christian Archaeological Society has sent an appeal to the prime minister himself.\n\nByzantinology scholar Paolo Odorico, director of the Center for Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies at Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris, visited the antiquities of Venizelos Station in 2013. He argued that the displacement of the Byzantine Middle Road would irreversibly destroy the structural authenticity of the antiquities of the monumental set, a value protected by international and Greek law.\n\n\u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c6\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bf\u03b9 \u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b2\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae \u03a0\u03bf\u03bc\u03c0\u03b7\u03af\u03b1! \u03a4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5; \u039a\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03be\u03b5\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5, \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1; \u03a4\u03c1\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5; \u0398\u03b1 \u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 Lego; \u03a3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b2\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae Disneyland; \u039d\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03b5! \u039a\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03cd\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2.\n\nWhat the metro construction procedures have brought to light is the Byzantine Pompeii!

And take on your responsibilities.\n\nFormer Thessaloniki Mayor Yiannis Boutaris also sent a letter to the prime minister speaking on behalf of the newly established \u201cThessaloniki Citizens\u2019 Movement for the Protection of Cultural Heritage.\u201d The same citizen movement initiated an online petition entitled \u201cSave the Antiquities at Venizelos Station in Thessaloniki.\u201d\n\nEuropa Nostra, the pan-European organization for Cultural Heritage, a recognized consultant and non-governmental partner of the European Union, the Council of Europe and UNESCO, addressed a letter to the Central Archaeological Council in support of the antiquities\u2019 remaining at the site.\n\nThe case before the Central Archaeological Council\n\nThe decision on the ultimate fate of the antiquities was entrusted to the Central Archaeological Council (CAC), a key body that decides on the fate of sites in Greece. Attic Metro SA, the company building the metro in Thessaloniki, presented its own study advocating for the removal of the antiquities. Following a 14-hour deliberation, the CAC eventually approved the company's proposal.
