Many higher-income workers pay far more, with the top marginal rate now 37% plus payroll taxes.\n\n\u201cIf anything, we should be taxing income from inheritances at higher rates than income from work,\u201d Batchelder, a former adviser to President Barack Obama who has advised several Democratic presidential campaigns on tax policy, said in a phone interview.\n\nTo make the system fairer, Batchelder proposes scrapping the estate tax and replacing it with an \u201cinheritance tax.\u201d The difference is more than semantic. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimates her proposal, laid out in detail in the report, could raise as much as $1.4 trillion over the next decade.\n\nTax Avoidance\n\nUnder the current system, wealthy Americans and their estates are required to pay 40% on bequests and gifts to heirs. They have many ways to avoid the tax, however. For married couples, the first $23.2 million of an estate is tax-exempt, and the rich can funnel far more to heirs tax-free using trusts and other complicated strategies.\n\nBatchelder\u2019s proposal would scrap this system, in which estates are taxed, and replace it with a system in which heirs pay income and payroll taxes on the money they receive. She tries to make sure only the richest heirs would pay the new tax by exempting inheritances from tax until they reach a certain lifetime threshold.\n\nIf lifetime inheritances of less than $2.5 million are exempt, the Tax Policy Center estimates the proposal would raise $340 billion over the next decade from the top 0.02% of heirs.\n\nA lifetime exemption of $500,000, affecting the top 0.18%, would raise $1.4 trillion. The actual revenue from an inheritance tax could be much higher, Batchelder said, because the estimates don\u2019t include the effects of some parts of the proposal, including the closing of many tax-planning loopholes.\n\nPolitical Purpose\n\n\u201cThe proposal would take a large step toward leveling the playing field between income from inherited wealth and income from work,\u201d Batchelder wrote. It also serves a political purpose, by replacing a tax that Republicans frequently characterize as a \u201cdeath tax\u201d that ends up double-taxing the wealthy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that you have to die. You shouldn\u2019t be fined for doing so,\u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Bloomberg Television in late 2017, as the GOP was poised to enact a law that doubled the estate-tax exemption.\n\nDemocrats, hoping to regain the White House and Senate in this year\u2019s elections, are hunting for ways to raise extra revenue for progressive priorities and to reduce a decades-long widening in wealth inequality.\n\nBatchelder\u2019s proposed inheritance tax is part of a book released Tuesday by Brookings\u2019 Hamilton Project. The volume includes other proposals to boost corporate taxes, impose a new financial-transaction tax and more efficiently administer the wealth tax proposed by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["americans", "inherit", "tax", "free"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ben Steverman"], "publish_date": "Tue Jan 28 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Americans Will Inherit $764 Billion This Year, Mostly Tax-Free; Paper proposes revamping estate tax to focus on heirs\u2019 income as  NYU professor behind report was tax-policy adviser to Obama", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"epoch": 1580212097, "pubdate": "2020-01-28T11:48:17", "article": {"section": "streettalk", "published_time": "2020-01-28T11:48:17", "author": "Ben Steverman"}, "og": {"description": "One way the rich get richer is through inheritance, and they're barely paying taxes on it.Americans are projected to inherit $764 billion this year and will pay an average tax of just 2.1% on that income, New York University law professor Lily Batchelder estimates in a...", "page_id": 85452072376, "site_name": "Newsmax", "image": "https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=eac9a01d-9457-4b45-b4ae-40cd2bec0b54&SiteName=Newsmax", "url": "https://www.newsmax.com/finance/streettalk/americans-inherit-tax-free/2020/01/28/id/951593/", "type": "article", "title": "Americans Will Inherit $764 Billion This Year, Mostly Tax-Free"}, "fb": {"app_id": 323020797885219, "admins": 100002083767056}, "twitter": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=eac9a01d-9457-4b45-b4ae-40cd2bec0b54&SiteName=Newsmax&maxsidesize=300", "alt": "One way the rich get richer is through inheritance, and they're barely paying taxes on it.Americans are projected to inherit $764 billion this year and will pay an average tax of just 2.1% on that income, New York University law professor Lily Batchelder estimates in a..."}, "description": "One way the rich get richer is through inheritance, and they're barely paying taxes on it.Americans are projected to inherit $764 billion this year and will pay an average tax of just 2.1% on that income, New York University law professor Lily Batchelder estimates in a...", "title": "Americans Will Inherit $764 Billion This Year, Mostly Tax-Free", "creator": "@newsmax", "site": "@newsmax", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.newsmax.com/Finance/Personal-Finance/americans-inherit-tax-free/2020/01/28/id/951593/"}, "news_keywords": "americans,  inherit,  tax,  free", "original-source": "https://www.newsmax.com/Finance/Personal-Finance/americans-inherit-tax-free/2020/01/28/id/951593/", "description": "Americans Will Inherit $764 Billion This Year, Mostly Tax-Free; Paper proposes revamping estate tax to focus on heirs\u2019 income as  NYU professor behind report was tax-policy adviser to Obama", "keywords": "americans, inherit, tax, free", "google-site-verification": "G8ES7h3vwQTlFRuKZLTkGYYr-GOyLKJVunu1JffVHbs"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.newsmax.com/finance/personal-finance/americans-inherit-tax-free/2020/01/28/id/951593/"}
