Pope Francis also met with Fern\u00e1ndez's partner, Fabiola Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, days after the Peronist's inauguration.\n\nOn Monday, Fern\u00e1ndez had heavily hinted a meeting would take place, telling the C5N news channel that he would travel to Europe later this month and that he would seek a meeting with the pontiff.\n\n\"Francisco knows how much I value, I love and appreciate him,\" said Ferna\u00e1ndez, adding that he would love the pontiff to visit Argentina soon but that the decision was Francis' to make.\n\n\"He must be resistant to come to Argentina for fear of being put on one side,\" he added.\n\n\"The Pope is not on any side, he is above all of us.\"\n\nThe Casa Rosada recently confirmed that career diplomat Luis Bellando would be Argentina's new ambassador to the Holy See.\n\n\u2013 TIMES/T\u00c9LAM/NA", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Jan 14 16:33:56 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "",
