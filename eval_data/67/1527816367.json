Friday, 21 February 2020\n\nSource: classfmonline.com\n\n2020-02-21\n\nAkufo-Addo, Prez Ghana\n\nPresident Nana Akufo-Addo has said Ghana, \u201cfor the first time in over 40 years\u201d, has maintained \u201ca fiscal deficit below five per cent of GDP for three years in a row\u201d.\n\nDelivering his State of the Nation Address to a one-sided Parliament on Thursday, 20 February 2020, Mr Akufo-Addo also said \u201cin three years, we have reduced inflation to its lowest level (7.8% in January 2020) since 1992\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in over 20 years, the balance of trade (that is the difference between our exports and imports) has been in surplus for three (3) consecutive years.\n\n\u201cOur current account deficit is shrinking, interest rates are declining, and the average annual rate of depreciation of the cedi is at its lowest for any first term government in the Fourth Republic.\n\n\u201cOur economic growth has rebounded to place Ghana among the fastest growing economies in the world for three years in a row at an annual average of 7%, up from 3.4% in 2016, the lowest in nearly three decades\u201d, the President said.\n\nAccording to him, the international community has taken note of his government\u2019s performance, \u201cresulting in Ghana, today, being the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in West Africa\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe sovereign credit ratings agencies have upgraded our ratings, and also improved the outlook for this year, notwithstanding the fact that it is an election year.\n\n\u201cThis is a massive vote of confidence in the current management of the economy, as best illustrated by Ghana\u2019s successful issue of the longest-dated Eurobond ever issued by a sub-Saharan African country, with investors placing fifteen billion United States dollars ($15 billion) of orders for Ghana\u2019s forty-one (41) year Eurobond.\n\n\u201cThe seven (7) year Bond attracted the lowest coupon rates ever for Ghana at six point three-seven-five percent (6.375%), compared with the nine point two-five percent (9.25%) Ghana had to pay for a similar Eurobond issue in 2016. No wonder Bloomberg, the reputable global financial media house, earlier this week, highlighted Ghana as the top candidate for an economic leap in Africa.\n\n\u201cThis expression of confidence is important because it will lead to enhanced investments in our economy, and the accompanying greater numbers of jobs\u201d, he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Feb 21 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.ghanamma.com/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.ghanamma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/32188734.jpg"}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Business News of Friday, 21 February 2020 Source: classfmonline.com 2020-02-21 Akufo-Addo, Prez Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo has said Ghana, \u201cfor the first time in over 40 years\u201d, has maintained \u201ca fiscal deficit below five per cent of GDP for three years in a row\u201d.
