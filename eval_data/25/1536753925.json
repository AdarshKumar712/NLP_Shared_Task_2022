Last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook officially confirmed that his company is on track to open its first store in India sometime in 2021.In an interview, Cook said that the company got a special approval as the government of India wanted Apple to work with a local partner. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be a very good partner in retail. We like to do things our way,\u201d Cook said.\n\nNow it seems like Apple will not have to find a partner and it\u2019s all thanks to the role US president Donald Trump played in it. Cook in an interview with Fox News said that the Trump administration did lobby for Apple to get the ball rolling. \u201cThe administration worked on this with the Indian government and that change has been made,\u201d Cook said in the interview.\n\nElaborating further on its India retail plans, Cook said that in 2020 Apple will get its online store ready. The first Apple store , however, will be up and running sometime in 2021. No further details about location or the exact timelines have been revealed but it\u2019s clear that Trump did play a pivotal role in it.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of Trump, the US president has had an interesting \u2014 to say the least \u2014 equation with Apple and its CEO. In the past, Trump has praised and criticised Apple in equal measure. In an FBI investigation of a shooting incident, Trump said that Apple should fully cooperate with the authorities, something which the company said it was doing. Trump has also said that he has had at times worked on tariffs to \u2018help\u2019 Apple in its fight against Samsung. And of course, there was the infamous incident where he referred to Tim Cook as Tim \u2018Apple\u2019.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Apple Store in India", "Tim Cook", "Donald Trump", "Apple Store", "Apple India", "Apple CEO", "apple"], "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Apple store", "Apple", "Tim Cook"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The 1st Apple store in India is set to open in 2021.
