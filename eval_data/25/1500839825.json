Led by the Socialist Pedro S\u00e1nchez, in partnership with the far-left Podemos party, it is the first coalition Spain has had in the modern era. Vox, which is now Spain\u2019s third party in parliament, has vowed to oppose what it calls \u201cthe lefty consensus\u201d and has taken a tough line against feminism and LGBT initiatives.\n\nBoycott\n\nThe far-right party has made its support for a budget bill in the southern region of Murcia contingent on allowing parents to boycott classes they deem inappropriate for their children. The Popular Party (PP) and Ciudadanos, which govern in a right-wing coalition there, need the support of Vox in the local parliament and have agreed to the measure.\n\nThe PP\u2019s leader, Pablo Casado, has embraced the policy recently, even though it has not been in his party\u2019s manifesto.\n\nHowever, although Spain\u2019s 17 regional governments have some control over education matters, this parental authorisation policy is not allowed under national law. Spain\u2019s government has given the administration in Murcia one month in which to cancel the measure before it takes legal steps.\n\n\u201cThey intend to break school co-existence and the culture of dialogue in order to impose a blind and uncritical authoritarianism,\u201d read a manifesto against the measure signed by the eight education ministers in the regions where the Socialists govern.\n\nThe controversy is a new battleground in Spanish politics, where Catalan and Basque nationalism had been the main drivers of polarisation. Mr Casado has accused the S\u00e1nchez government of behaving like communist Cuba after a spokeswoman for the prime minister said that children \u201cdo not belong to their parents\u201d.\n\n\u201cAre we going to get to the point where children also inform on their parents if they are not good revolutionaries?\u201d said Mr Casado.\n\nVox is campaigning to introduce the policy in the Madrid region as well, where the PP and Ciudadanos also need its support to govern. However, the local wings of both parties there have voiced concerns, reflecting a broader unease within both the PP and Ciudadanos at the influence that the far right is having on them.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "New left-wing coalition under pressure amid controversy over parental authorisation", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/assets/images/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "New left-wing coalition under pressure amid controversy over parental authorisation", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14146907"}, "news_keywords": "News, World, Europe, Santiago Abascal, Pedro Sanchez, Pablo Casado, Spain", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "Spain\u2019s far-right party blasts \u2018erotic games\u2019 for toddlers", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/spain-s-far-right-party-blasts-erotic-games-for-toddlers-1.4146907", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "New left-wing coalition under pressure amid controversy over parental authorisation", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4146906&origw=1440", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4146906&origw=1440", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimesWorld", "creator": "@Hedgecoe", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/spain-s-far-right-party-blasts-erotic-games-for-toddlers-1.4146907", "title": "Spain\u2019s far-right party blasts \u2018erotic games\u2019 for toddlers", "description": "New left-wing coalition under pressure amid controversy over parental authorisation", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4146906.1579625044!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/spain-s-far-right-party-blasts-erotic-games-for-toddlers-1.4146907"}
