Copper miners in Chile are considering cutting production amid strict measures to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, an association of companies in the sector has told Reuters.\n\nA report by Sonami, which represents copper miners across Chile, the world\u2019s largest producer, said the realities of the coronavirus were forcing companies to weigh tough decisions.\n\n\u201cWe have seen miners go from providing information about the disease and taking preventive measures to halting projects already underway,\u201d the association said in a statement sent to Reuters. \u201cA decrease in production is already being contemplated in some companies.\u201d\n\nLarge companies have reduced the workforce at their mines by up to 30% in a bid to cut contagion risks while others, such as state-run giant Codelco [CODEL.UL], the world\u2019s largest copper miner, have suspended expansion and improvement projects.\n\nSonami said the small and medium-sized companies it represents had been particularly hard-hit since they do not have the financial resources behind them of multinational giants such as BHP BHP.AX, Anglo American AAL.L, and Antofagasta ANTO.L.\n\nAnglo American told Reuters it would announce any eventual impact on production, but said it \u201cbelieved that (the impact) would be minimal considering that it could continue processing stock-piled mineral.\u201d\n\nAntofagasta said the temporary reduction in its workforce to date had had a \u201climited\u201d impact on production but that it planned to review its annual output projections in its first quarter report.\n\nCodelco and BHP did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSonami said that some medium-sized miners, already hard hit by softening global copper prices, had begun temporarily closing operations.\n\nOn Friday the Chilean government reported 3,737 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 22 deaths from COVID-19 to date.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["UK", "CHILE", "COPPER", "EXCLUSIVE", "Base Metals", "Chile", "Company News", "Copper Ore Mining (TRBC level 5)", "Coronavirus", "Copper", "Enterprise Reporting", "Exclusive", "Financials (Legacy)", "South America / Central America", "Job Cuts", "Specialty Mining & Metals (TRBC level 4)", "Specialty Mining & Metals (NEC) (TRBC level 5)", "Metals Markets", "Mining", "Mineral Resources (TRBC level 2)", "Metals & Mining (TRBC level 3)", "Major News", "Reuters Top News"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Fabian Cambero"], "publish_date": "Fri Apr  3 13:57:06 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Copper miners in Chile are considering cutting production amid strict measures to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, an association of companies in the sector has told Reuters.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/article/_next/static/images/favicon-9d0324f5d28e80e699a4e92617ab6f30.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow", "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Exclusive: Chilean copper miners 'considering production cuts' -
