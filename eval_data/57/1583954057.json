It kind of makes sense, though, because we don't yet know what the toll is,\" Republican Senator Bill Cassidy said on a conference call with journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCassidy, of Louisiana, and New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez, who represent two of the states hit hardest by the pandemic, said their bill would allocate money based on states' populations, infection rates and revenue losses in order to ensure that money goes where it is needed most.\n\nFILE PHOTO: US Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ). REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe two senators discussed their proposed legislation as Democrats and Republicans worked on details of a possible US$450 billion-plus deal to provide more aid to small businesses and hospitals hurt by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nState governors and local officials across the United States have been pleading for more federal aid to provide essential services, as Americans stay home and businesses have closed because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCongressional leaders said they could vote on the latest bill, which would follow a US$2.3 trillion aid package passed in March, as soon as this week.\n\nCassidy and Menendez said they hoped their bipartisan bill could provide a framework for what they dubbed \"Covid 4,\" a subsequent tranche of coronavirus aid. COVID-19 is the name of the illness caused by the coronavirus.\n\n\"Covid 3.5 (the current bill) is more focused on business and hospitals, primary, and testing,\" Menendez said. \"We think this is well poised for what I believe will be a Covid 4.\"\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["COVID-19", "coronavirus", "Bill Cassidy", "Bob Menendez", "relief bill"], "tags": ["coronavirus", "Bob
