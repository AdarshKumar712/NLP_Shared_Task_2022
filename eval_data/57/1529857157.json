official results showed, after exit polls from weekend elections suggested it would crash out.\n\nInitially predicted to pick up 4.8% of Sunday\u2019s vote in the city State, the final count put AfD at 5.3%, just above the 5% minimum required to enter Parliament under German electoral law.\n\nThe anti-immigrant party nonetheless suffered losses compared to the last State elections in 2015, when they picked up 6.1% of the vote.\n\nLargely unpopular in the cosmopolitan port city, the AfD struggled further in the wake of a racist attack which killed nine in central German city Hanau last week.\n\n\u201cGetting in by a whisker is a huge success in this case because we were subjected to campaigns from the entire political establishment of the city of Hamburg,\u201d said regional AfD leader Dirk Nockemann.\n\nThe liberal FDP party, meanwhile, also appeared to edge over the five-percent hurdle to retain its place in Hamburg\u2019s parliament.\n\nFinal estimates put the FDP on 5% exactly, although with some constituencies yet to finalise their counts, their fate remained in the balance on Monday morning.\n\nThe liberal party was hit hard by a recent scandal in the eastern state of Thuringia where their candidate was elected state premier with the help of votes from the AfD.\n\nThe move broke a taboo on cooperation with the far right and unleashed a national scandal which also plunged Angela Merkel\u2019s ruling CDU party into crisis.\n\nThe centre-right party also suffered embarrassment at the Hamburg polls, slipping to just 11.2% of the vote, a showing nearly five percentage points worse than in 2015.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Hamburg Parliament", "Angela Merkel", "AfD leader Dirk Nockemann", "German electoral law", "germany's afd", "afd party
