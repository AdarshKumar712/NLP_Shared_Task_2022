The most successful captain of the country is currently\n\nplaying just ODI format.\n\nHowever Mashrafe\u2019s future is not clear yet as the BCB president Nazmul\n\nHassan Papon indicated that the Zimbabwe series will be the lanky pacer\u2019s\n\nlast as the captain since they would appoint a long term captain, eying 2023\n\nWorld Cup. He also said, if Mashrafe wants to continue cricket, he should\n\nprove his performance and match fitness to make him available.\n\n\u201cFirstly I don\u2019t know what will happen after this series,\u201d Mashrafe\n\nsaid, replying to a query whether he would tour Pakistan.\n\n\u201cBut in Bangladesh cricket\u2019s needs, I am ready to go anywhere. What I\n\nfeel is that the BCB is our guardian. What decision they will take, they will\n\ntake it thinking not for once or twice, they will think about it for 10\n\ntimes. So I believe they will take the best decision. We should consider\n\ncricket board\u2019s decision as final.\u201d\n\nBangladesh has already twice visited Pakistan for first two legs of tour\n\nthat included a three-match T20 series and a first Test. On both occasion,\n\nMushfiqur Rahim opted against touring Pakistan, citing security reasons.\n\nBangladesh will visit Pakistan for last phase of tour that includes a\n\nsolitary ODI and second Test. Mushfiqur Rahim is believed to opt against\n\nthird phase of tour also.\n\n\u201cWe should honour the decision of Mushfiqur Rahim,\u201d Mashrafe said. \u201cThe\n\nBCB has given the option to opt against touring Pakistan. Moreover the\n\nselector will take the decision who will be the part of the team. If I am\n\ncalled up for Pakistan tour, I will give my answer.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.bssnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BSS-logo-red-2.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "http://www.bssnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cricket-Board-BCB-has-planned-to-give-Mashrafe-Bin-Mortaza.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.0.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.bssnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cropped-BSS-Final-Logo-300x300.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.bssnews.net/?p=355313"}
