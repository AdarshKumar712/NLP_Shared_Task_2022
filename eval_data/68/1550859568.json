As a result, we will not permanently suspend any accounts based solely on our automated enforcement systems. Instead, we will continue to look for opportunities to build in human review checks where they will be most impactful. We appreciate your patience as we work to get it right\u2014this is a necessary step to scale our work to protect the conversation on Twitter.\u201d\n\nTwitter is continuing to build systems that enable its teams to enforce its rules remotely around the world, and it is increasing employee assistance and wellness support for everyone involved in this type of work.\n\nThe social network is also instituting a global content severity triage system in order to ensure that content that presents the biggest risk of harm is addressed first.\n\nDaily quality assurance checks are being performed on its content enforcement processes in order to ensure that the company is agile in responding to rapidly developing issues.\n\nAnd Twitter continues to engage with its partners globally to keep escalation paths open and remain aware of urgent cases.\n\nFinally, the Twitter Rules are being reviewed for potential changes that may need to be implemented in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nGadde and Derella wrote, \u201cAs we\u2019ve said on many occasions, our approach to protecting the public conversation is never static. That\u2019s particularly relevant in these unprecedented times. We intend to review our thinking daily, and we will ensure that we\u2019re sharing updates here on any new guidance.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Much like YouTube and Facebook, machine learning systems will carry a heavier load.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/AdWeek/assets/images/icons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"wp-parsely_version": "2.0", "lytics": {"topics": "aw:coronavirus,aw:social-pro-daily"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@adweek", "title": "Twitter Details Changes to Content Moderation During the Coronavirus Pandemic", "description": "Much like YouTube and Facebook, machine learning systems will carry a heavier load.", "creator": "@adweek", "image": "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TwitterBirdMagnifyingGlass4-600x315.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": "34404791,617231194", "pages": 126756847074, "app_id": 329778260413541}, "og": {"title": "Twitter Details Changes to Content Moderation During the Coronavirus Pandemic", "description": "Much like YouTube and Facebook, machine learning systems will carry a heavier load.", "url": "https://www.adweek.com/digital/twitter-details-changes-to-content-moderation-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TwitterBirdMagnifyingGlass4-600x315.jpg"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=570229326", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Much like YouTube and Facebook, machine learning systems will carry a heavier load."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.adweek.com/digital/twitter-details-changes-to-content-moderation-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/"}
