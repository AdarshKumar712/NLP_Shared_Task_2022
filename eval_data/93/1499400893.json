Japan has also removed South Korea from its list of trusted trading partners.\n\n\n\nIn December, Japan partially lifted its export control on one of the three products subject to the tightened screening.\n\n\n\nSouth Korea views the Japanese moves as retaliation against 2018 South Korean Supreme Court rulings ordering Japanese firms to compensate South Korean victims of forced labor during Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.\n\n\n\nThe Export-Import Bank of Korea also said it plans to extend 7.5 trillion won to help local companies take the lead in the growing electric vehicle battery business.
