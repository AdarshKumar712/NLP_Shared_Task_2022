She was tested at the state laboratories because she was displaying symptoms and had direct, face-to-face contact in late February with a person in New York who has tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nHer case is considered \"presumptive positive\" until it can be confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.\n\nThe state is working to identify people who had contact with the woman. This includes children and adults associated with the nursery school. They will be asked to go into self-quarantine.\n\nThe Health Department noted that initial studies of the coronavirus indicate that it does not affect children as severely as adults.\n\nThe other two coronavirus cases in Rhode Island both involved people who went on a Saint Raphael Academy field trip to Europe in mid to late February. A third person who went on the trip, and lives in Massachusetts, has also tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nSeventeen other Rhode Islanders have been tested for coronavirus, and results have come back negative. Test results are pending for 13 other Rhode Islanders. About 210 people in the state are under self-quarantine due to potential exposure to the virus.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Journal Staff"], "publish_date": "Fri Mar  6 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Rhode Island Department of Health announced Friday night that a woman in her 60s who works at the Smithfield Avenue Nursery School in Pawtucket has become the state\u2019s third coronavirus case.The woman is at home with mild symptoms, the Health Department announced.
