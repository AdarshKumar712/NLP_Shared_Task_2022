Everywhere, elected leaders are struggling with how vacation rentals should be regulated and who should regulate them.\n\nShould Airbnb homes be required to meet all of the safety and licensing standards and regulations as hotels? Who should have jurisdiction, local governments or the state government?\n\nOnce again in Tallahassee, the issue is on lawmakers\u2019 agendas.\n\nSenate Bill 1128 and House Bill 1011 are proposing what former state Sen. Greg Steube of Sarasota (now Congressman Steube) tried for two years. That is have the state preempt local governments and rule all vacation rentals.\n\nThis is a conundrum, to be sure. Government is best closest to the people. Citizens incorporate precisely to have control over their communities, not be ruled by the far-away state.\n\nBut at the same time, you can make an argument that NIMBYism is so pervasive that vocal neighbors want their cities to ban vacation rentals altogether. In the process, they are forgetting all about property rights. Why should you be allowed to have 10 relatives stay with you but your neighbor be prohibited from renting his home to 10 of his old college friends?\n\nSB 1128 and HB 1011 are indeed flawed \u2014 mostly on the regulations they would create for those advertising vacation rentals. Both bills should be tabled.\n\nAt some point, to craft a balanced law, legislators must realize this is an issue that requires thoughtful, rational examination and study outside the emotional and horse-trading confines of the annual legislative session.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Author", "Matt Walsh"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan 23 11:23:33 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Local governments across Florida struggle to deal with regulating vacation rentals.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.yourobserver.com/sites/all/themes/yourobserver/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "W5qEe1V8ciPqgo7dPyNIXQ-wHbIW1dBCGQ-dzCLvNgQ", "fb": {"pages": 288643121405}, "description": "Local governments across Florida struggle to deal with regulating vacation rentals.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Your Observer", "type": "article", "title": "Who should rule vacation rentals? | Sarasota | Your Observer", "url": "https://www.yourobserver.com/article/who-should-rule-vacation-rentals", "description": "Local governments across Florida struggle to deal with regulating vacation rentals.", "updated_time": "2020-01-24T01:50:01-05:00", "image": "https://www.yourobserver.com/sites/default/files/279759_standard.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.yourobserver.com/article/who-should-rule-vacation-rentals", "title": "Who should rule vacation rentals?", "description": "Local governments across Florida struggle to deal with regulating vacation rentals.", "image": "https://www.yourobserver.com/sites/default/files/279759_standard.png"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-23T11:23:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-24T01:50:01-05:00"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.yourobserver.com/article/who-should-rule-vacation-rentals"}
