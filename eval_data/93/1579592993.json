Sources close to the second vice president, Pablo Iglesias, explained that on Tuesday they agreed with the President, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, to approve the new minimum income in May. Escriv\u00e1 explained that the new social aid will benefit about 100,000 single-parent households.\n\nThe minister stressed that it is \u201cabsolutely\u201d necessary to advance this income \u201cto avoid the most vulnerable suffering.\u201d The plan will take the \u201cbest incentives that exist in Europe\u201d and will involve itineraries for inclusion in the labour market, as they also exist in the income of the Basque Country.\n\nIn recent weeks there had been a tug of war between Escriv\u00e1 and Iglesias on account of the minimum income. The Minister of Social Security worked from the beginning of the legislature on an aid that was structural, analysed the different options and wanted to coordinate it with the autonomous communities, which are competent and have already deployed some similar aid. Iglesias, for his part, wanted to advance it due to the extraordinary situation caused by the Coronavirus crisis.\n\nEscriv\u00e1 did not specify the total cost of the measure for public coffers, nor how many residents could benefit. \u201cIt will not be an individual benefit but will put the emphasis on households and will differ according to the structure of these households,\u201d he said. The minister assured that this income will reduce extreme poverty \u201cin very high numbers\u201d and that the municipalities will be decisive in its management.\n\nEscriv\u00e1 also announced that there are already almost four million workers affected by ERTE. It is, he said, 16 per cent of the entire workforce, reflecting the size of the impact the economy has suffered as a result of the pandemic.\n\nEscriv\u00e1 specified that almost two million people affected by ERTE are already collecting unemployment benefits. And another two million workers will start collecting it in May when all files are registered.\n\nThe minister insisted that these are \u201cunprecedented measures, which are very extensive and that will be able to protect the incomes of more than six million people.\u201d\n\nThe head of Social Security specified that of the nearly 6.3 million people who receive aid in this crisis, about four million will receive unemployment benefit for having been affected by ERTE, another 1.4 million will be self-employed and about 900,000 workers, most of whom are temporary, have lost their jobs and will receive unemployment benefits.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["ERTE", "newspaper", "Euro Weekly News", "Coronavirus news", "Spain's Minister of Social Security discusses social aid for families and ERTE for the workforce affected by the worldwide Coronavirus pandemic", "News Spain", "world news"], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": "Thu Apr 16 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Spain's Minister of Social Security discusses social aid for families and ERTE for the workforce affected by the worldwide Coronavirus pandemic.
