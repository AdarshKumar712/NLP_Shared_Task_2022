IPOB is proscribed by the federal government. I, as the commissioner of police in Abia cannot sit here and allow any proscribed group to operate anywhere in this state.\n\n\u201cI am saying this again for emphasis that there is no way police will allow a proscribed group to participate in the burial of the king and queen of Afaraukwu simply because they are the parents of their acclaimed leader, we will not allow that and we cannot take anything for granted in the face of abundant intelligence on threat by IPOB.\u201d\n\nThe CP said members can attend the event individually, but that the police would react if IPOB flag, insignia or any form of identification is seen.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Feb 10 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.ghanamma.com/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.ghanamma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/police.jpg"}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "IPOB Leader, Kanu The Abia state police command has vowed to disrupt the funeral of the parents of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), if members of the group showed up.
