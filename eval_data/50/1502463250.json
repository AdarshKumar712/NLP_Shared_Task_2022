This may be one of the strangest things I've ever seen... \u2014 Doug Black Jr (@dougblackjr) January 22, 2020\n\nBut behind closed doors - where the media is not allowed - senators have been flouting the quaint guidelines of the chamber that typically prizes decorum.\n\nGum-chewing, snacking, yawning and alleged napping could be seen throughout the cramped chamber, the Associated Press reported.\n\nSenators were especially restless Wednesday, local time, as lawmakers convened less than 12 hours after the marathon session that stretched to nearly 2 am.\n\nA number of senators were seen resting their eyes, dozing and appearing to take brief naps, according to CNN and the Associated Press.\n\nA cartoonist for the New York Times observing the proceedings even managed to sketch Republican senator James Risch dozing off.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, were seen passing notes and doing crosswords while senators were speaking.\n\nNYT has a sketch artist covering impeachment, catching moments like Sen.

No pacing, note-passing, working on other matters or chit-chat. It\u2019s all designed to focus the senator-jurors on the issues at hand. So napping is not, in theory, part of the plan.\n\nA number of senators also left the chamber during the opening days, some to conduct lengthy TV interviews, leaving a number of seats empty, AP reported.\n\n9- As the night wore on, senators were restless. Some walked to the back of the chamber and stretched. Sen. Gillibrand took off her heels, sighed then wrapped herself in a red blanket at her desk.

Source: AAP More\n\nTrump is charged with abusing his power by trying to pressure Ukraine to investigate political rival and leading Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden.\n\nThe Republican-controlled US Senate has voted on party lines to approve the rules for President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, rejecting Democratic efforts to obtain evidence and ensure witnesses are heard.\n\nStory continues", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Nick Whigham"], "publish_date": "Thu Jan 23 07:28:49 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The first two days have seen some unusual scenes take place behind closed doors at Donald Trump's impeachment trial.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@Y7News", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The first two days have seen some unusual scenes take place behind closed doors at Donald Trump's impeachment trial.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xHzmtqusPaGPeIPGm1OPZg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-01/ca43f3c0-3db4-11ea-affd-6285c639997c", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xHzmtqusPaGPeIPGm1OPZg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-01/ca43f3c0-3db4-11ea-affd-6285c639997c"}, "title": "'Strangest thing I've ever seen': Milk-drinking senators struggle to stay awake in Trump impeachment trial"}, "summary": "Latest Australian & world news including breaking news, news headlines, top stories, photos and videos at Yahoo News Australia.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=8c854a57-1d59-303f-8d33-06cb59698f39&src=web", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, impeachment trial, US senators, James Risch, Chief Justice John Roberts", "description": "The first two days have seen some unusual scenes take place behind closed doors at Donald Trump's impeachment trial.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xHzmtqusPaGPeIPGm1OPZg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-01/ca43f3c0-3db4-11ea-affd-6285c639997c", "description": "The first two days have seen some unusual scenes take place behind closed doors at Donald Trump's impeachment trial.", "title": "'Strangest thing I've ever seen': Milk-drinking senators struggle to stay awake in Trump impeachment trial", "url": "https://au.news.yahoo.com/milkdrinking-senators-struggle-to-stay-awake-as-impeachment-trial-kicks-off-072849411.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 114503341893201}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=8c854a57-1d59-303f-8d33-06cb59698f39&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=8c854a57-1d59-303f-8d33-06cb59698f39&src=web"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://au.news.yahoo.com/milkdrinking-senators-struggle-to-stay-awake-as-impeachment-trial-kicks-off-072849411.html"}
