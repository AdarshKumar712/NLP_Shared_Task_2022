You don\u2019t have to do it. They suggest for it a period of time.\u201d\n\nThe president emphasized, \u201cBut this is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CDC is recommending that Americans wear a basic cloth or fabric mass that can be purchased online or simply made at home, probably material that you have at home. These face coverings can be easily washed or reused,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical-grade or surgical-grade masks. We want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job.\n\nTrump then was talking about coronavirus models, and quipped that he wasn\u2019t involved in these models\u2026but other kind of models.\n\nMore from Political Flare\n\nYes, Trump jokes about having sex with models and Twitter was grossed out:\n\nOH MY FUCKING GOD.
