Even if it happens, they don\u2019t know whether there will be fans in the stands of their palatial new home for its first football game.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is occurring during a historic year for this NFL franchise. The unprecedented circumstances are dismaying to coach Sean McVay, but he hasn\u2019t given up hope of a proper homecoming for the Rams.\n\nWhen asked Friday on a video conference call about the likelihood of opening SoFi Stadium in four months without fans, McVay said: \u201cWe certainly hope that that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not going to speculate on any of that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s still so far away. I mean, think about how much has taken place even (in the last) two months that we\u2019ve been in these quarantine positions, I think we\u2019ll just let it play itself out. It\u2019s still going to be a football game, and we\u2019re hopeful that it\u2019ll be as normal as possible, but obviously the health and safety of everybody is the first and foremost consideration.\u201d\n\nEverybody involved with the NFL is spending this unusual spring conducting their offseason business through computer screens and remote workouts. The Rams are no different, and McVay is virtually gathering his rookies together this weekend, including running back Cam Akers and receiver Van Jefferson.\n\nMcVay, whose passion for the methodology of teaching and leadership is well known, has also used this down time to learn. He recently spent time speaking with Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta after being connected through the Kroenke family, which owns both teams.\n\n\u201cHe is really an impressive guy,\u201d McVay said of Arteta, the ex-Arsenal midfielder who became Pep Guardiola\u2019s coaching protege at Manchester City before taking over in North London last December. \u201cI think he\u2019ll do a great job, and I\u2019m certainly a fan of Arsenal and love following them, just through those relationships, through the Kroenke family. But it was more than anything a chance for us to connect, kind of share some ideas.\n\nBut the upcoming season was thrust to the forefront of most teams\u2019 minds by the release of the schedule this week. The Rams, Chargers and Raiders are all opening new stadiums this year, nearly a half-decade after Rams owner Stan Kroenke won the intense three-team competition for the lucrative right to return the NFL to Los Angeles.\n\nKroenke got his fellow owners\u2019 approval in large part because the billionaire married to a Walmart heir had a compelling, well-financed plan to build a flagship NFL stadium in the nation\u2019s second-largest metropolitan area. SoFi Stadium is rapidly nearing completion as workers push on amid the pandemic, and it will be a major venue for sports in the nation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nBut its foundational tenants might open it with no fans in the stands, with only their own shouts and cheers from the field and sideline.\n\nWhen asked if he could imagine the reality of such a thing, McVay chuckled.\n\n\u201cI can, because I coached in the UFL my second year in coaching, and it felt like we didn\u2019t play in front of many fans in some of those situations,\u201d McVay said.\n\nMcVay was a 23-year-old receivers coach and offensive quality control coach for the Florida Tuskers of the defunct United Football League in 2009.\n\n\u201cIt feels very similar to practice,\u201d McVay said of that experience in the minor leagues. \u201cI can probably yell across (to) the (far) sidelines for the other coaches to hear you. If that\u2019s what it is, we\u2019ll just be thankful to be playing in any form or fashion, but certainly the fans bring an added dynamic that we can\u2019t match.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he\u2019ll have to watch his language when television microphones can hear his every word, McVay chuckled again.\n\n\u201cI think the cameras will have to bleep it out some more,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat May  9 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "lytics": {"topics": "Health News, Sports News"}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Rams still hoping for guests at SoFi Stadium opening party", "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Rams finally have a date and an opponent for the long-awaited opening of SoFi Stadium, the multibillion-dollar reason for their return to California over four years ago.
