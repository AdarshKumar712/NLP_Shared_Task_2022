An international standard aquarium will be built there,\" Pawar said while presenting his budget in the Legislative Assembly.\n\nPawar, who also holds the finance portfolio, presented the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government's maiden budget in the Lower House.\n\nHe announced an outlay of Rs 1,400 crore for the Department of Tourism. Aaditya Thackeray, son of the chief minister, is the state Tourism and Minister.\n\nPawar also announced creation of a special fund to combat global warming and climate change, the issues over which Aaditya Thackeray has time and again expressed concerns.\n\nPawar said several pilgrimage spots in the state, including Mahurgad in Nanded district, Parli Vaijanath, Aundha Nagnath, Narsi Namdev in Hingoli district, ancient Shiva temple in Ambarnath and Hazrat Khwaja Shamna Mira Dargah in Miraj, would be developed.\n\nFor the development of popular tourist destinations, such as Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani Rs 100 crore have been set aside in the budget.\n\nThe government also set aside Rs 55 crore for the diamond jubilee celebrations of the state, which was formed on May 1, 1960.\n\nBesides, Rs 25 crore have been allocated for the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nThe budget also increased the MLA fund from Rs 2 crore (declared in 2011) to Rs 3 crore.
