The Assembly should choose its president with complete legitimacy.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan opposition branded the actions of the Maduro administration a \"parliamentary coup\".\n\n\"The acts of harassment suffered by deputies, journalists and members of the diplomatic corps when attempting to enter the premises of the National Assembly, to elect the new authorities of its board of directors, are unacceptable for democratic coexistence,\" read a statement from the Argentine Foreign Ministry.\n\n\"The Argentine government also calls on the democracies of the world to help facilitate this process of dialogue so that Venezuela can recover as soon as possible the democratic normality that has historically characterised that country,\" the statement added.\n\n\"The protection of the independence of the powers and immunities of parliamentarians are indispensable conditions for the normal functioning of the democratic system.\"\n\nThe Fern\u00e1ndez administration, however, did not sign up to the join statement led by the Lima Group, which condemned the Maduro government in harsher terms.\n\nFormer president Mauricio Macri's government formed a key part of the group, which includes the United States, Canada and several Latin American governments.\n\nSol\u00e1 added in his statement that \"the Argentine government has been trying by all means\" to achieve \"he full recovery of the democratic functioning of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\"\n\nIn contrast to the Argentine government's statement, opposition Juntos por el Cambio lawmakers said in a press release that they \"strongly\" repudiated the \"institutional coup \"carried out\" by \"the dictatorship\" in Venezuela.\n\n\"It is inadmissible and an offence against democracy, that forces that obey the dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro today blocked the Parliament to opposition deputies with the purpose of damaging a democratic process,\" the opposition bank warned in a statement.\n\nThey described the appointment of Parra as \"illegitimate.\"\n\n\u2013 TIMES/NA/AFP", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Jan  6 12:06:02 2020", "summary": "",
