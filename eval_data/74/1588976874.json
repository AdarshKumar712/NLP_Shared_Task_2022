ties for animals so they could get adopted.\n\nFollowing the devastating Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma experience in 2017, Sir Darius Brown felt a need to help after learning about the displaced dogs.\n\nHe decided to make bow ties to make the displaced dogs look dapper and cute so they could be more noticeable in hopes of finding their forever homes faster.\n\nPic Credit: Dazhai Brown\n\nBrown visited the adoption center where he learned that hundreds of dogs are euthanized daily at some shelters due to overcrowding.\n\nAs a dog lover, he was devastated by the reality at the shelter and that was the beginning of his mission to help save the lives of dogs and cats by donating his handmade bow ties to animal shelters across the nation.\n\nHe came up with the idea in 2017.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to help the dogs that I saw on TV that had lost their families and their homes.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a lot of money to help so I decided to use my creative skills of making stylish bow ties for the dogs to wear to help them be more noticeable so they could get adopted faster into new loving homes,\u201d Brown wrote on Instagram.\n\nHe has been making bow ties as a hobby since 2010. According to his mum, Joy Brown, he started by making bow ties for animals at an ASPCA in New York. \u201cOnce he got there, he realized dogs all over the world needed homes, and he wanted to help them stand out,\u201d she said.\n\nHe has since made more than 500 bow ties and started a company, \u2018Beaux and Paws\u2019. Which has been donating countless bow ties to shelters and adoption centers across the USA and the United Kingdom and has also helped countless shelter pets find loving forever homes.\n\nChristmas donation at Mt. Pleasant Animal Shelter \u2013 Pic Credit: Dazhai Brown\n\nHe has helped get dozens of cats and dogs adopted at more than 20 shelters, according to his mum. \u201cI know that I\u2019m doing something right, raising an amazing kid who is inspiring people all over the world,\u201d his mom said. \u201cI tell him all the time, \u201dI wanna be like you when I grow up.\u2019\u201d\n\nPic Credit: sirdariusbrown.com\n\nCurrently, the youngster is raising money on his GoFundMe page to enable him to deliver bow ties to shelters in all 50 states.\n\nIn 2018, former President Barack Obama learned of Sir Darius\u2019 mission and\u200bsent him a personal letter commending him for his commitment to community service.\n\nIn January, he was featured as one of GoFundMe\u2019s kid heroes and has just been named the 2020 New Jersey State Honoree for the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["13-year-old boy", "bow ties", "cats and dogs", "letter", "obama", "best of africa", "business & opportunities", "inspiring"], "tags": ["CORONAVIRUS"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Apr 25 09:50:15 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A 13-year-old entrepreneur from\u00a0New Jersey\u00a0is sewing tiny handmade stylish bow ties for animals so they could get adopted.
