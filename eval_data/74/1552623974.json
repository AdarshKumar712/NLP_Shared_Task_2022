Students will be able to complete courses wherever they reside. It is anticipated that campus will continue to be open and functioning.\n\nThis change may require some adjustments in currently planned courses. Lab courses that cannot be adapted for remote delivery will be cancelled. Students may find it necessary to adjust their schedules as a result of these changes and can do so through the registration portal at my.BYUI.edu. Information regarding course changes will be available to students before the end of Winter Semester.\n\nFor current and official BYU-Idaho communication regarding COVID-19, visit the I-Prepare website.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Byu-Idaho", "spring semester", "BYU-I"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Mar 19 02:02:35 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "BYU-Idaho - Student Media", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://byuicomm.org/byuiscroll/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/06/cropped-Untitled-1-32x32.gif", "meta_data": {"description": "BYU-Idaho - Student Media", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Spring Semester 2020 to be held online only - BYU-I Scroll", "description": "BYU-Idaho announced Spring Semester 2020 will be held online, some lab courses will be cancelled.", "url": "https://byuiscroll.org/spring-semester-2020-to-be-held-online-only/", "site_name": "BYU-I Scroll", "updated_time": "2020-03-19T02:02:40+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://byuicomm.org/byuiscroll/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2020/03/Spori-Outside-scaled.jpg", "secure_url": "https://byuicomm.org/byuiscroll/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2020/03/Spori-Outside-scaled.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 682}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/byuiscroll/?hc_ref=ARTSyragAUBEehWuQMPLj7Bz0few-vQqqgl0e5PA-suWJpvlLa3i0DlFiDwnW2h68jk&fref=nf", "tag": "spring semester", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-03-19T02:02:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-19T02:02:40+00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://byuicomm.org/byuiscroll/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/06/cropped-Untitled-1-270x270.gif"}, "canonical_link": "https://byuiscroll.org/spring-semester-2020-to-be-held-online-only/"}
