COVID-19 is battering the global economy in numerous ways. Chinese business travel and tourism has all but stopped, global airlines are not going to China and cruise lines are canceling most Asia-Pacific itineraries.\n\nThis is a huge problem for major travel destinations, including in the US, where some 3 million Chinese tourists visit each year. Chinese tourists to the US are among the biggest spenders of any foreign tourists. Travel in Europe is also sure to be severely impacted as Milan, Italy, the center of the new infections in that country, is a major travel hub for the Continent, the research agency said.\n\nShuttered Chinese factories are also a problem for countries and companies fastened into China\u2019s manufacturing supply chain. Apple, Nike and General Motors are some prominent American examples.\n\nUnder Moody\u2019s baseline scenario, which assumes the outbreak remains contained to China and largely plays out by the spring, the agency has forecast that China\u2019s economy will contract in the first quarter of this year, and growth for the year will be cut by a full percentage point to 5.4 per cent.\n\nThe global economy will suffer a hit to GDP of almost a percentage point (annualized) in the first quarter, and slow by 0.4 percentage point to 2.4 per cent in 2020. The global potential growth is an estimated 2.8 per cent.\n\nThe US economy will experience growth of only 1.3 per cent in the first quarter (annualized), down by 0.6 percentage point because of the virus. Growth in 2020 is now expected to be 1.7 per cent, down 0.2 percentage point. The US economy\u2019s potential growth is an estimated near 2 per cent.\n\n\u201cA pandemic will result in global and US recessions during the first half of this year. The economy was already fragile before the outbreak and vulnerable to anything that did not stick to script. COVID-19 is way off script\u201d, the agency said.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 came out of nowhere. It may be what economists call a black swan \u2013 a rare and inherently unforeseeable event with severe consequences. We all hope the global effort to contain the virus will ensure this black swan will not fly. But it is prudent to be prepared if it does\u201d, Moody\u2019s Analytics added.\n\n\u2013IANS\n\nsan/bc", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["pandemic", "recession", "moody", "global", "likely", "covid", "becomes"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Feb 26 09:12:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "New York, Feb 26 (IANS) A global recession is likely if COVID-19 becomes a pandemic, and the odds of that are uncomfortably high and rising with", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cropped-AVTAR_CIAUG2018-512-1-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "New York, Feb 26 (IANS) A global recession is likely if COVID-19 becomes a pandemic, and the odds of that are uncomfortably high and rising with", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Global recession likely if COVID-19 becomes pandemic: Moody's | Canindia News", "description": "New York, Feb 26 (IANS) A global recession is likely if COVID-19 becomes a pandemic, and the odds of that are uncomfortably high and rising with", "url": "https://www.canindia.com/global-recession-likely-if-covid-19-becomes-pandemic-moodys/", "site_name": "Canindia News", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CI2020LogoD-1M.png", "width": 383, "height": 70}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CanIndiaNews", "published_time": "2020-02-26T09:12:00+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 348280475330978}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cropped-AVTAR_CIAUG2018-512-1-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.canindia.com/global-recession-likely-if-covid-19-becomes-pandemic-moodys/"}
