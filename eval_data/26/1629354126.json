TODAY, WE HAVE A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT WE COULD EXPECT. GUIDANCE FOR REOPENING MASSACHUSETTS SCHOOLS THIS FALL COMING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ELEMENTARY AND SECONDA EDUCATION VIA MEMO ABOUT KEY SAFETY SUPPLIES THAT WILL BE NEEDED. THINGS LIKE REDESIGNING CLASSROOM SPACE TO MAINTAIN SIX FEET OF SEPARATION AT ALL TIMES AND MASKS FOR ALL STAFF AND STUDENTS. >> I FEEL LIKE IT\u2019S GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A KID TO WEAR A MASK ALL DAY. I KNOW ESPECIALLY IN THE HEAT. NICHOLE: KELLY MCMURROW AND HER DAUGHTER, PENNY, ARE FROM BRIDGEWATER. >> MY DAUGHTER IS NINE. SHE\u2019S GOING TO BE GOING INTO FOURTH GRADE. NICHOLE: THE GUIDANCE CALLS FOR SMALLER, ISOLATED GROUPS OF STUDENTS ASSIGNED TO ONE TEACHER, WITH GROUP SIZES RESTRICTED TO 12, INCLUDING A MAXIMUM OF 10 STUDENTS IN EA ROOM. MCMURROW IS DOUBTFUL THIS WI WORK AT HER DAUGHTER\u2019S SCHOOL. >> THEY HAD NINE THIRD-GRADE CLASSES AND EACH CLASSROOM HAD PROBABLY 26, 27, 28 KIDS IN THE CLASS. TELL ME, HOW WOULD IT WORK? WOULD THERE EVEN BE ENOU CLASSROOMS TO HAVE CLASSES WITH ONLY 10 OR 12 KIDS IN A CLASS? NICHOLE: THE MEMO ALSO INCLUDES DIRECTIVES ON INCREASED HANDWASHING, AS WELL AS CLEANING AND DISINFECTING FACILITIES -- ALL WITH THE HOPE OF GETTING THINGS BACK TO SOME TYPE OF NORMAL. >> I\u2019M HOPEFUL THAT THINGS WILL GET BACK TO NORMAL I DON\u2019T KNOW, I CAN\u2019T SAY 100% CONFIDENT, BUT I\u2019M HOPING. NICHOLE: WE ARE ALL HOPING. THE MEMO ALSO INCLUDED DIRECTIVES ON THINGS LIKE MASKS, SANITIZER AND THE OTHER NECESSITIES THAT THE SCHOOLS WILL ALL NEED.
