Advertise With Us\n\nAn RCMP officer alleged to have been driving dangerously near Neepawa will not face any charges, Manitoba\u2019s police watchdog has concluded.\n\nThe Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba was made aware of the incident by the RCMP on June 12, 2019, and IIU investigators interviewed three civilian witnesses and one witness officer.\n\nAll three witnesses saw different pieces of what they described as erratic driving by the police officer.\n\nThe majority of the erratic driving was observed by one civilian witness, who observed it in their rear-view mirror.\n\nAnother witness initially believed that weather conditions might have played a role in the erratic driving they had seen.\n\nThere were vague descriptions as to the duration of the erratic driving, and all three civilian witnesses were reluctant to go to court and testify.\n\nThe witness officer, who had direct contact with the other police officer, saw no signs or incidents of erratic driving during his contact with him.\n\nIn his report on the investigation, IIU civilian director Zane Tessler said he \"was not satisfied that there was sufficient and cogent evidence available to satisfy the necessary standard of reasonable grounds to believe an offence has occurred.\"\n\nThe full report is available online at iiumanitoba.ca.\n\n\u00bb The Brandon Sun", "keywords": [],
