We see far too many instances, so many instances where a tense situation escalates instead of deescalating, and a life is taken,\" Singh said.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/cmaconthehill\/status\/1267450218422943753\r\n\r\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer also spoke Monday morning about the protests in the U.S., saying he was heartbroken by Floyd's killing and that no one should have to live in fear of the police.\r\n\r\nScheer says all levels of government have much more to do when it comes to addressing racism in Canada.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/cmaconthehill\/status\/1267458112564461568\r\n\r\nThe proposals come as protests continued to rage in the United States over the police killing of George Floyd, which was captured on video.\r\n\r\nThe protests in the U.S. have proven extremely polarizing, with those on the left and right of the political spectrum attacking each other on social media and elsewhere.","post_title":"Canadian leaders speak out against Floyd killing, racism in U.S.","post_excerpt":"Federal leaders are speaking out against racism as protests continue to rage on in the U.S. over the killing of a black man by a police officer.

And it's support that will give businesses the confidence to reopen, getting hard working Canadians back on the job,\" Trudeau says.\r\n\r\nMunicipalities have seen steep losses in revenues through the COVID-19 pandemic as fewer people pay for transit or parking, and recreation centres stay closed without programs to fill local coffers.\r\n\r\nThe City of Vancouver reported last month that more than 13,000 business closures and about 90,000 people losing their jobs in April resulted in losses of about $2 billion. Toronto alone says it's facing a $1.5-billion shortfall this fiscal year and will need to slash services.","post_title":"Feds announce $2B for struggling municipalities","post_excerpt":"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the government will fast-track $2.2 billion in the form of an accelerated GST rebate to help struggling municipalities.

His death, captured on citizen video, sparked days of protests in Minneapolis that have spread to cities around America.\r\n\r\nAccording to prosecutors, preliminary findings from an official autopsy last week said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller described the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as \"awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe criminal complaint said the autopsy \"revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.\"\r\n\r\nBen Crump, the attorney representing Floyd's family, said last week that he was commissioning the family's own autopsy. Floyd's family, like the families of other black men killed by police, wanted an independent look because they didn't trust local authorities to produce an unbiased autopsy.\r\n\r\nThe family's autopsy was conducted by Michael Baden and Allecia Wilson. Baden is the former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to conduct an autopsy of Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe.\r\n\r\nBaden also conducted an independent autopsy of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri. He said Brown's autopsy, requested by the teen's family, didn't reveal signs of a struggle, casting doubt on a claim by police that a struggle between Brown and the officer led to the shooting.\r\n\r\nThe officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter and is in custody in a state prison. The other three officers on scene, like Chauvin, were fired the day after the incident but have not been charged.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Minneapolis police union said in a letter to members that the officers were fired without due process and labour attorneys are fighting for their jobs. Lt. Bob Kroll, the union president, also criticized city leadership, saying a lack of support is to blame for the days of sometimes violent protests.\r\n\r\nWhen asked to respond, Mayor Jacob Frey said: \"For a man who complains so frequently about a lack of community trust and support for the police department, Bob Kroll remains shockingly indifferent to his role in undermining that trust and support.\" Frey said Kroll's opposition to reform and lack of empathy for the community has undermined trust in the police.\r\n\r\nGov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that Attorney General Keith Ellison would take the lead in any prosecutions in Floyd's death. Local civil rights activists have said Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman doesn't have the trust of the black community. They have protested outside his house, and pressed him to charge the other three officers.\r\n\r\nFreeman remains on the case.","post_title":"George Floyd family to release results of independent autopsy","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"george-floyd-family-autopsy","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-06-01 13:56:06","post_modified_gmt":"2020-06-01 17:56:06","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/toronto.citynews.ca\/?p=2250518","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","permalink":"https:\/\/montreal.citynews.ca\/2020\/06\/01\/george-floyd-family-autopsy\/","post_title_shortened":"George Floyd family to release results of independent autopsy","post_thumbnail":"<img width=\"127\" height=\"71\" src=\"https:\/\/montreal.citynews.ca\/wp-content\/themes\/samuel\/images\/transparent.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/montreal.citynews.ca\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/sites\/19\/2020\/06\/MNMIT404-528_2020_000000-e1591033374947-300x168.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive img-infinite-scroll wp-post-image\" alt=\"\">"},{"ID":218009,"post_author":"571","post_date":"2020-06-01 12:10:12","post_date_gmt":"2020-06-01 19:10:12","post_content":"TORONTO \u2013 Food Banks Canada is using the Toronto Blue Jays\u2019 idle Rogers Centre home as a makeshift warehouse with the goal of storing and sorting eight million meals for distribution around the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nClub owner Rogers and the team\u2019s Jays Care Foundation announced the initiative, dubbed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.foodbankscanada.ca\/Media\/News-Releases\/Rogers-and-Jays-Care-Foundation-Step-Up-to-the-Pla.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Step Up to the Plate<\/a>, on Monday, although the idea began taking shape in April, with food beginning to arrive at the stadium in early May.\r\n\r\nThere are already 1,000 food pallets, each with 1,000-4,000 items, at the dome, mostly stored in the outfield. The plan is to reach 6,000 pallets with 10 million pounds of food, which hundreds of volunteers from Rogers will then pack into individual hampers containing a week\u2019s worth of meals.\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">For three decades, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JaysCare?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JaysCare<\/a> &amp; the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BlueJays?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BlueJays<\/a> have been committed to addressing food insecurity across.<\/p>\r\nWe're excited to build on this impact as we partner with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Rogers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Rogers<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/foodbankscanada?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@foodbankscanada<\/a> to Step Up to the Plate for Canadian families in need! <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/ForwardTogether?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ForwardTogether<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/uk3WchS6Zt\">pic.twitter.com\/uk3WchS6Zt<\/a>\r\n\r\n\u2014 Jays Care Foundation (@JaysCare) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JaysCare\/status\/1267422400272125952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 1, 2020<\/a><\/blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\r\n\r\nThe target is to fill 390,000 such hampers, the equivalent of eight million meals.\r\n\r\nA start to the 2020 baseball season will not interfere with the program, as a contingency plan would move the pallets and packing process onto the stadium\u2019s empty concourses, with work only taking place when the team is on the road.\r\n\r\nEven if play begins, there\u2019s also no guarantee the Blue Jays will be able to play in Toronto, as the border closure between Canada and the United States along with the mandatory 14-day quarantine for all arrivals into the country have forced the team to consider backup plans.\r\n\r\nThe likeliest alternative for the club is to play out of its spring home in Dunedin, Fla., where a second training camp will be held should owners and players agree on a return-to-play deal. But the club\u2019s strong preference is to play its home games in Toronto, if allowed by health officials.\r\n\r\nPacking of the food hampers is expected to start in a couple of weeks, with shipments to food banks across the country to follow. The food\u2019s arrival at the dome is being staggered based on donation rates, the facility\u2019s capacity and limitations on volunteers due to physical distancing measures.\r\n\r\nRogers Centre joins Scotiabank Arena, home to the Toronto Maple Leafs and Raptors, and BMO Field, home to Toronto FC and the Argonauts, as local sports venues to be repurposed to help the community amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/AboutRogers\/status\/1267421815871279105\r\n\r\nMaple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment turned Scotiabank Arena into a giant kitchen back in April, producing 10,000 meals a day for front-line health-care workers and community agencies helping vulnerable segments of the population. Last month, the kitchens at BMO Field pushed the output up another 3,000 meals.\r\n\r\n<em>Rogers is the parent company of this station.<\/em>","post_title":"Blue Jays' Rogers Centre to become home to 10 million pounds of food","post_excerpt":"Food Banks Canada is using the Toronto Blue Jays\u2019 idle Rogers Centre home as a makeshift warehouse with the goal of storing and sorting million meals for distribution around the country.","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"rogers-centre-10-million-pounds-food","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-06-01 15:19:36","post_modified_gmt":"2020-06-01 19:19:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.citynews1130.com\/?p=3253109","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","permalink":"https:\/\/montreal.citynews.ca\/2020\/06\/01\/rogers-centre-10-million-pounds-food\/","post_title_shortened":"Blue Jays' Rogers Centre to become home to 10 million pounds of...","post_thumbnail":"<img width=\"127\" height=\"71\" src=\"https:\/\/montreal.citynews.ca\/wp-content\/themes\/samuel\/images\/transparent.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/montreal.citynews.ca\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/sites\/19\/2020\/06\/Rogers-Centre-Step-Up-to-the-Plate-Food-Banks-Canada-310x174.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive img-infinite-scroll wp-post-image\" alt=\"\">"}]};

        	<p>OTTAWA (NEWS 1130) — In what the prime minister is calling &#8220;extremely troubling,&#8221; a military report accuses several Ontario long-term care homes of negligence and appalling conditions for people living there.</p>
<p>The report details first-hand accounts of cockroach infestations, patients crying for help while staff stood idle, residents not being bathed for weeks and being forcefully fed, and COVID-19 patients allowed to wander freely.</p>
<p>“There are things in there that are extremely troubling,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. “We need to take action.”</p>
<p>The military was deployed to nursing homes in Ontario and Quebec to reinforce workers overwhelmed by the pandemic, unable to keep up with residents’ needs because of all the protective measures they need to take, or off work because they’re ill themselves.</p>
<p>To date, 36 members of the Canadian Forces have come down with COVID-19 while working, up from 28 cases less than a week ago. Fourteen of the military members with COVID-19 are in Ontario and 22 are in Quebec.</p>
<p>Trudeau said the premiers of Ontario and Quebec have both asked for the military to extend the deployment and he expects to agree. The Canadian military will keep assisting in nursing homes in both provinces, Trudeau announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Over the last few weeks, our women and men in uniform have been working to help the most vulnerable Canadians, as we deal with this pandemic. And as the need for their help continues, we’ve received new requests to extend this period of deployment in both Ontario and Quebec. We will be following up,” he said.</p>

<p>Trudeau said he spoke to Ontario Premier Doug Ford earlier in the morning and assured him the federal government will be there to support the province.</p>

<p>&#8220;We need to do a better job of taking care of our elders in long-term care facilities in Ontario and, indeed, right across the country,&#8221; Trudeau said.</p>
<p>He also said that the problems uncovered by the military go beyond the facilities were members were stationed in Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many, extraordinary, excellent long-term care facilities across this country,&#8221; Trudeau added. &#8220;There are some that, obviously, are not doing as well, that we need to make sure we are improving the standards of care.&#8221;</p>
