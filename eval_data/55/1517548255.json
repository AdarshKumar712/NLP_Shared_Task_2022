This is the third time the Blue and White leader has made a major speech on the issue in the last two weeks.\n\nDuring a speech in Abu Snan , a mixed Muslim, Druze and Christian Arab local council northeast of Acre, Gantz highlighted the figure of 5,000 people he claimed die every year due to such issues. He called it \u201cCase 5000\u201d in reference to the names of the criminal cases against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and made several ambitious commitments to improving health care in the country.\n\nAmong those commitments was a pledge to fund 2,500 hospital beds, and create positions for 500 doctors and 1,500 nurses.\n\n\u201cFive thousand people die every year in hospitals because of infections and illnesses due to the neglect of our health service,\u201d declared Gantz, although it is unclear exactly where his figure comes from.\n\n\u201cThese are the lives of people lying in hospital corridors and waiting for a bed to become free; the lives of people waiting six months for an appointment with a specialist doctor, or waiting for hours in emergency rooms,\u201d continued the Blue and White leader.\n\nGantz said that he would reduce political earmark budgets and use royalties from Israel\u2019s natural gas reserves to invest in the health system and redress some of its problems.\n\ncnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });\n\nif(window.location.pathname.indexOf(\"656089\") != -1){console.log(\"hedva connatix\");document.getElementsByClassName(\"divConnatix\")[0].style.display =\"none\";}\n\nHe also pledged that the next health minister would be from Blue and White to ensure that his pledges are fulfilled.\n\nDuring Gantz\u2019s speech in Abu Snan, which has a sizable Druze population, the Blue and White leader also pledged to amend the Nation State Law passed in 2018 as a basic law which ascribed national rights to Jews alone in the State of Israel. The law was strongly criticized by many, including the leadership of the Druze community, who said that the law made them second class citizens.\n\nGantz specifically said, however, that he would amend the law, not repeal it.\n\n\u201cI do not intend to give up on equality. I will work to make the correct amendment. This law is a correct law in its being a nation-state law, but it offended you [the Druze community] \u2013 and I intend to anchor equality in a basic law alongside it, because all citizens in Israel have equal rights,\u201d he said.\n\nIn response to Gantz\u2019s criticism of the health system, Health Minister Yaakov Litzman sent a letter to the Blue and White leader to inform him of steps the ministry is already taking, or intends to carry out, to redress some of the problems it faces.\n\nLitzman said that the ministry had already adopted a plan to add more than 2,400 new hospital beds, half of which have already been provided and half of which would be provided by 2022.\n\nHe also noted that the ministry was in advanced planning for two hospitals, which would add another 1,000 hospital beds to the health service, as well as the addition of 2,500 nurses and more than 1,000 doctors.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Blue and White leader promises to pass basic law for equality in Israel during speech in Abu Snan in the Galilee", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/Icons/PNG/favicon-76.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Blue and White leader promises to pass basic law for equality in Israel during speech in Abu Snan in the Galilee", "fb": {"pages": 159050394216641, "app_id": 313311835670174}, "og": {"site_name": "The Jerusalem Post | JPost.com", "title": "Gantz slams gov\u2019t health record, pledges 2,500 new hospital beds", "type": "Article", "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/450017", "url": "https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/gantz-slams-govt-health-record-pledges-2500-new-hospital-beds-617047", "description": "Blue and White leader promises to pass basic law for equality in Israel during speech in Abu Snan in the Galilee"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/450017", "url": "https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/gantz-slams-govt-health-record-pledges-2500-new-hospital-beds-617047", "site": "Jerusalem_Post", "description": "Blue and White leader promises to pass basic law for equality in Israel during speech in Abu Snan in the Galilee", "title": "Gantz slams gov\u2019t health record, pledges 2,500 new hospital beds"}, "robots": "\u201dmax-snippet:160,"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/gantz-slams-govt-health-record-pledges-2500-new-hospital-beds-617047"}
