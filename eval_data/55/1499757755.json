It was also meant to give spiritual support ahead of the traditional Lunar New Year festival to staff of level-2 field hospital No. 2 in South Sudan.Taking part in UN peacekeeping operations is a new task of the Vietnam People\u2019s Army, demonstrating the country as a responsible member of the international community, enhancing its stature and prestige in the world, and helping to safeguard the nation soon, from afar, and by peaceful means.Over the last five years, Vietnam\u2019s peacekeeping force has attained impressive initial outcomes recognised by the international community.Major General Nguyen Viet Luong, Political Commissar of the Vietnam Military Medical University, recently returned from the UN mission in South Sudan. He said this country has an area that is three times larger than Vietnam\u2019s and a population of about 13 million, most of whom have to rely on the UN\u2019s aid for their daily life.\u201cSuch a fact makes any of us further treasure an environment of peace we are living in,\u201d he noted.Captain Nguyen Thi Thu Ngan, who returned from level-2 field hospital No. 1 in Bentiu of South Sudan in late 2019, said despite insufficient infrastructure conditions, staff of the hospital made joint efforts to overcome difficulties. In more than one year, the hospital gave treatment to more than 2,200 patients, 10 times higher than the number other hospitals dealt with.Aside from peacekeepers\u2019 sharing and video calls with staff of level-2 field hospital No. 2 in South Sudan, the programme featured videos showing activities of Vietnam\u2019s military medical officers at the UN mission./.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["peacekeeping", "Vietnam Department of Peacekeeping Operations", "Ministry of National Defence", "level-2 field hospital", "South Sudan", "military medical officers", "updated Vietnam news", "Vietnamplus", "Vietnam News Agency"], "tags": ["Climate Change", "level-2 field hospital", "Ministry of National Defence", "Party Building", "South Sudan", "UNSC Non-Permanent Membership", "Vietnam Department of Peacekeeping Operations", "Vietnamplus", "Vietnam ASEAN Chairmanship Year 2020", "peacekeeping", "updated Vietnam news", "East Sea", "Vietnam News Agency", "military medical officers"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Jan 20 19:38:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "An exchange programme was held in Hanoi on January 20 to share the outstanding outcomes of Vietnam\u2019s participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations over the last five years.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "peacekeeping, Vietnam Department of Peacekeeping Operations, Ministry of National Defence, level-2 field hospital, South Sudan, military medical officers, updated Vietnam news, Vietnamplus, Vietnam News Agency", "description": "An exchange programme was held in Hanoi on January 20 to share the outstanding outcomes of Vietnam\u2019s participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations over the last five years.", "author": "VietnamPlus", "robots": "index,follow", "googlebot": "index,follow,archive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 120834779440, "app_id": 1960985707489919}, "og": {"site_name": "VietnamPlus", "rich_attachment": "true", "type": "article", "title": "Programme highlights outcomes of Vietnam\u2019s participation in UN peacekeeping | Politics | Vietnam+ (VietnamPlus)", "description": "An exchange programme was held in Hanoi on January 20 to share the outstanding outcomes of Vietnam\u2019s participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations over the last five years.", "url": "https://en.vietnamplus.vn/programme-highlights-outcomes-of-vietnams-participation-in-un-peacekeeping/167589.vnp", "image": {"url": "https://cdnimgen.vietnamplus.vn/t460/Uploaded/wbxx/2020_01_20/VNs_participation_in_UN_peacekeeping.jpg", "width": 460, "height": 345}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/VietnamPlus", "published_time": "2020-01-20T19:38:00+07:00", "section": "Politics", "tag": "Vietnam News Agency"}}, "canonical_link": "https://en.vietnamplus.vn/programme-highlights-outcomes-of-vns-participation-in-un-peacekeeping/167589.vnp"}
