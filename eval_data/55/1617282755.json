Fourteen of the military members with COVID-19 are in Ontario and 22 are in Quebec.\n\nTrudeau said the premiers of Ontario and Quebec have both asked for the military to extend the deployment and he expects to agree. The Canadian military will keep assisting in nursing homes in both provinces, Trudeau announced Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOver the last few weeks, our women and men in uniform have been working to help the most vulnerable Canadians, as we deal with this pandemic. And as the need for their help continues, we\u2019ve received new requests to extend this period of deployment in both Ontario and Quebec.
