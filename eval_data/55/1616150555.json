He is stable, under observation, and breathing without a ventilator. He will be away on medical leave for at least seven days. The result of the test is expected for the next few days. The minister has told people close to him that he intends to leave open a channel of dialogue with Mr. Bolsonaro to try to avoid the deepening of the crisis among the powers after a video of a cabinet meeting that took place on April 22 revealed attacks on the STF. He is virtually Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s only link with Brazil\u2019s highest court. Sources say Mr. Toffoli considers there is room to discuss with the government two matters of institutional concern: the permanence of Abraham Weintraub in office, which displeases the court since the Education minister called for the arrest of STF justices; and the possible seizure of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s cell phone for investigation.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["brazil stock", "brazil investment", "brazil market", "investments in brazil"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Chief Justice\u2019s potential infection may delay talk with Bolsonaro", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/misc/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "keywords": "brazil stock, brazil investment, brazil market, investments in brazil", "description": "Chief Justice\u2019s potential infection may delay talk with Bolsonaro", "fb": {"pages": 197587446941661}}, "canonical_link": ""}
