This allowed to mitigate negative effects in Central Asia for food security and agriculture, share of which in each country\u2019s GDP is different: 4.4 percent in Kazakhstan, 11.6 percent in Kyrgyzstan, 19.2 percent in Tajikistan, 20.0 percent in Turkmenistan and 28.8 in Uzbekistan.\n\nSuch a conclusion was stated during an online briefing for regional media and expert community by a Lead Agricultural Economist at the World Bank Sergiy Zorya.\n\nCentral Asian countries took urgent measures to strengthen the food security and support the agro-food sector in the pandemic conditions. The region\u2019s governments brought state food reserves and began to increase their stocks, established administration control over food prices, reduced their cost due to export restrictions and lower tariffs on the imported food products. At the same time, authorities accelerated the lifting of restrictions on the transportation of agricultural products and movement of the industry\u2019s workers as well as provided farmers and agro-enterprises with deferral on repayment of loans and other incentives that stimulate their activities.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, agriculture may become one of the main stabilizing factors and growth driver for Central Asian countries\u2019 economies. Moreover, it is able to ensure more jobs than any other industry,\u201d said Sergiy Zorya.\n\nThe expert highlighted that after the pandemic, the governments need to focus on restoring agricultural trade in Central Asia, improvement of regional cooperation in sanitary and phytosanitary safety, management of state food reserves, increasing investments in veterinary services and digital transformation of the agro-food field.\n\nPhoto: astanatimes.com", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Agriculture", "Central Asian", "economies", "World Bank experts"], "tags": ["World Bank experts", "Central Asian", "economies", "agriculture"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "COVID-19 pandemic has not led to a significant destabilization of the global food markets.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico?v=4", "meta_data": {"yandex-verification": "4000d310625250d5", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "url": "https://old.qazaqtv.com/en/view/business/page_213412_agriculture-may-be-driver-for-central-asian-economies-say-world-bank-experts", "type": "article", "title": "Agriculture may be driver for Central Asian economies, say World Bank experts", "description": "COVID-19 pandemic has not led to a significant destabilization of the global food markets.", "image": {"identifier": "https://old.qazaqtv.com/upload/anounces/top_91115724edfa019e6bb68f9f68bf6573.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "site_name": "old.qazaqtv.com"}, "date.created": "2020-06-03 10:58:16", "date.available": "2020-06-03 10:58:16", "date.updated": "2020-06-03 10:58:16", "date.modified": "2020-06-03 10:58:16", "keywords": "Agriculture,Central Asian,economies,World Bank experts", "news_keywords": "Agriculture,Central Asian,economies,World Bank experts", "description": "COVID-19 pandemic has not led to a significant destabilization of the global food markets.", "image": "https://old.qazaqtv.com/upload/anounces/top_91115724edfa019e6bb68f9f68bf6573.jpg", "theme-color": "#174d54", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "old.qazaqtv.com", "title": "Agriculture may be driver for Central Asian economies, say World Bank experts", "description": "COVID-19 pandemic has not led to a significant destabilization of the global food markets.", "image": {"src": "https://old.qazaqtv.com/upload/anounces/top_91115724edfa019e6bb68f9f68bf6573.jpg"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://old.qazaqtv.com/en/view/business/page_213412_agriculture-may-be-driver-for-central-asian-economies-say-world-bank-experts"}
