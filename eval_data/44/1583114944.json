He said US policy betrayed an \u201cutter contempt for human life.\u201d\n\nHis rebuke comes shortly after the US blacklisted five companies based in the United Arab Emirates for trading in Iranian petrochemicals. Three companies in China, three in Hong Kong and one in South Africa were also added to the list this week, as Washington attempts to choke off Tehran\u2019s oil revenues.\n\n\u201cWashington\u2019s increased pressure against Iran is a crime against humanity\u2026 all the world should help each other to overcome this disease,\u201d Reuters quoted an Iranian official as saying on Friday.\n\n\u201cOur policy of maximum pressure on the regime continues,\u201d US special representative for Iran Brian Hook told reporters, even though Iran is the worst-hit country in the Middle East by the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak and may face economic catastrophe as a result.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that the US has imposed \u201cno sanctions\u201d on medication or humanitarian assistance going into Iran. However, US financial sanctions have in effect prevented Tehran from buying the necessary supplies, while shipping sanctions have interfered with humanitarian deliveries.\n\nChina has called on the US to offer sanctions relief to Iran, with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Beijing tweeting on Wednesday that the policy was \u201cagainst humanitarianism and hampers Iran\u2019s epidemic response,\u201d as well as deliveries of aid by the UN and other organizations.\n\nIran has seen at least 1,400 deaths from Covid-19 so far, with more than 19,000 confirmed cases.
