members Greece and Bulgaria has jeopardised a deal on refugees between Ankara and the bloc. Turkey \u2014 which hosts 4 million refugees, including 3.6 million Syrians \u2014 said it had no choice but to ease its efforts in containing the refugee influx,\n\ndue to the military escalation in Syria\u2019s Idlib province.\n\nThe north-western province, which is the opposition\u2019s last stronghold in Syria, borders Turkey. Advances by the Syrian government there have displaced close to one million people, who are heading towards Turkey.\n\nAnkara says it can no longer hold back people trying to reach Europe. The move has led thousands of migrants to Turkey\u2019s frontiers, with Greece and Bulgaria bolstering security, and using force and teargas to fend people off.\n\nIn 2016, Ankara and the EU struck a deal that stemmed a flow of refugees heading for Europe \u2014 many of them fleeing the war in Syria. Turkey agreed to stop people reaching the EU\u2019s external borders in neighbouring Greece and Bulgaria, and to take back people deemed ineligible for asylum.\n\nIn exchange, the EU pledged an overall 6 billion euros ($7.4 billion) in humanitarian aid for refugees in Turkey, as well as to take in up to 72,000 Syrians eligible for asylum \u2014 one Syrian for every person sent back to Turkey.\n\nThe agreement was the EU\u2019s major response to a migration crisis that saw hundreds of thousands of people reaching Greece and Bulgaria by land and sea via Turkey starting from 2015.\n\nEU capitals were and remain bitterly divided over how to deal with the influx of asylum seekers and migrants seen in recent years, which has met with a populist backlash in countries such as Italy, Hungary, Poland and Austria.\n\nWith several member states unwilling to take in large numbers and consensus among leaders blocked, the EU turned to Ankara. So far 4.7 billion euros have been allocated and 3.2 billion euros have been paid out, according to the latest figures from the European Commission.\n\nBrussels keeps close oversight of the funds. Specific non-governmental organisations \u2014 for example Unicef and the World Food Programme \u2014 are chosen for projects focusing on health, education and infrastructure.\n\nThis is a sore point for Ankara, as it wants the cash directly. Turkey charges its wealthy neighbours of leaving it in the lurch to host millions of refugees. It has a population of 82 million, compared to the EU total of 447 million.\n\nSome 1.2 million refugees and migrants reached Europe in 2015 and early 2016, according to the UNCHR.\n\nErdogan said on Monday that Turkey has been carrying the refugee burden alone for nine years, adding that it is now too late. Turkey warned months ago: \u201cIf you don\u2019t share the burden with us then we will open gates\u2019\u2019. The president also criticises European countries for not supporting his long-touted plan for a safe zone along Turkey\u2019s border with Syria, where Syrians could be re-settled.\n\n\u201cWe either give them a life of dignity in their own land, or everyone shares the burden. Now the time for unilateral sacrifice is over,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkey has long sought more European support for its military activities in Syria, where it is fighting the Syrian government forces of President Bashar al Assad. Ankara also accuses the EU of tardiness in paying out the funds promised under the 2016 agreement.\n\nThe European Commission remains committed to the deal and has raised the prospect of further funds being lined up once the 6 billion euros has been paid out.\n\nThe EU executive has repeatedly called on Turkey to stick to its commitments in recent days, and says it is in \u201cintensive dialogue\u201d with Ankara, including on the question of additional support to deal with the current situation. \u2014 dpa\n\nRelated", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Mar  3 16:57:46 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Turkey\u2019s decision to open its western borders to European Union members Greece and Bulgaria has jeopardised a deal on refugees between Ankara and the", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i1.wp.com/www.omanobserver.om/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cropped-Observer-small-logo.jpg?fit=32%2C32&ssl=1", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "I2R4B5YEA4G0GJBm5CDpP6W8SFDQDHynEomhgg2G0ik", "msvalidate.01": "793A9CB41644AF7EDFD998A6107C36AE", "p": {"domain_verify": "3326a96a9e4d95424d464f2ae64491ea"}, "yandex-verification": "93aa150bf71d481a", "description": "Turkey\u2019s decision to open its western borders to European Union members Greece and Bulgaria has jeopardised a deal on refugees between Ankara and the", "news_keywords": "oman, omanobserver, sultanate, muscat, news, oman news, sultan", "original-source": "https://www.omanobserver.om/eu-turkey-migration-deal-what-is-it-and-could-it-collapse/", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "EU-Turkey migration deal: What is it and could it collapse?", "description": "Turkey\u2019s decision to open its western borders to European Union members Greece and Bulgaria has jeopardised a deal on refugees between Ankara and the", "url": "https://www.omanobserver.om/eu-turkey-migration-deal-what-is-it-and-could-it-collapse/", "site_name": "Oman Observer"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/omanobserver", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/omanobserver", "section": "Analysis", "published_time": "2020-03-03T16:57:46+04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Turkey\u2019s decision to open its western borders to European Union members Greece and Bulgaria has jeopardised a deal on refugees between Ankara and the", "title": "EU-Turkey migration deal: What is it and could it collapse?", "site": "@omanobserver", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.omanobserver.om/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Observer-Default-Image-2.png?fit=180%2C122&ssl=1", "creator": "@omanobserver"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.5.3", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i1.wp.com/www.omanobserver.om/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cropped-Observer-small-logo.jpg?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.omanobserver.om/eu-turkey-migration-deal-what-is-it-and-could-it-collapse/"}
