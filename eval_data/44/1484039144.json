They got me because I thought I was going home,\u2019 she told ComicBook.com.\n\nBut when will she leave? (Picture: AMC)\n\nKevin has hinted at a juicy storyline (Picture: Gene Page/AMC)\n\nSpeaking to TV Insider, Kevin hinted that Virgil might not be all he seems, leading to an exciting storyline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe explained: \u2018I just want to tell [fans] that in this world of The Walking Dead, anything is possible.\n\n\u2018At this point, I\u2019m just excited for Virgil to get on the map, and start to mix it up in this world.\n\n\u2018I am anxiously hoping that the fans can appreciate what this journey is about to be.\n\n\u2018For people who love Michonne, this will be a rewarding piece of the journey for her. I think they\u2019re going to have a good time with the twists and turns of this story.\u2019\n\nThe actor also teased that \u2018every facet of humanity is up for grabs because of everybody\u2019s need to survive.\u2019 So there\u2019s a chance we could see Virgil turn\u2026\n\nBut Kevin was keeping schtum on that, adding: \u2018I\u2019m going to leave it at that, and tell them to have a great time figuring it out.\u2019\n\nThe Walking Dead season 10 will return to AMC on 23 February.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
