In a televised speech, Rouhani told Washington to return to the nuclear pact, which Washington abandoned in 2018, under which Tehran curbed its nuclear work in return for the lifting of international sanctions on Iran.\n\nSince quitting the agreement, Washington has reimposed sanctions to throttle Iran's oil exports as part of a \"maximum pressure\" policy.\n\nThe United States says its aim is force Tehran to agree a broader deal that puts stricter limits on its nuclear work, curbs its ballistic missile program and ends its regional proxy wars. Iran says it will not negotiate as long as sanctions remain in place.\n\nTehran has gradually taken steps to reduce its compliance with the deal, which prompted Britain, France and Germany to formally accuse it on Tuesday of violating the terms.\n\n\"This Mr. Prime Minister in London, I don\u2019t know how he thinks. He says let\u2019s put aside the nuclear deal and put the Trump plan in action,\" Rouhani said.\n\n\u201cIf you take the wrong step, it will be to your detriment. Pick the right path. The right path is to return to the nuclear deal.\"\n\nIran denies any intent to acquire nuclear weapons and says its breaches of the deal would be reversed if Washington lifts sanctions. \"All of our activities are under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA),\u201d said Rouhani.\n\n\"NOT DEAD\"\n\nForeign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told Reuters that the deal was still alive: \"No, it\u2019s not dead. It\u2019s not dead,\" Zarif said on the sidelines of a conference in New Delhi.\n\nBut he told the conference Trump's withdrawal from the earlier deal made new negotiations with Washington pointless: \"I had a U.S. deal and the U.S. broke it. If I have a Trump deal, how long will it last?\"\n\nIn its biggest step away from the agreement yet, Iran announced on Jan. 5 it would abandon all limitations on enriching uranium set down in the pact.\n\nBritain, France and Germany reacted by activating a dispute mechanism in the deal on Tuesday, which eventually could lead to the reimposing of U.N. sanctions. Iran called this step a \u201cstrategic mistake\u201d.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Washington now expects the U.N. sanctions to \"snap back into place\" as a result of the European move. The European countries have said that is not their goal.\n\nRouhani upbraided European powers for not standing up to Trump. Iran says the Europeans have reneged on promises to find ways to circumvent the U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe flare-up in nuclear diplomacy comes as military confrontation between Washington and Tehran has also reached a new peak.\n\nThe United States killed an Iranian general in a drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3. Tehran responded a week ago by launching missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq. No Americans were hurt, but hours later Iran shot down a Ukrainian airliner in what its authorities have acknowledged as a tragic mistake, prompting anti-government protests at home.\n\nRouhani repeated Iran's longstanding position that peace can come to the Middle East only when the United States withdraws.\n\n\"American soldiers today are not secure in the region ... We don\u2019t want there to be insecurity in the world. We want you to go from here, but not with war. We want you to leave the region intelligently and it\u2019s to your benefit,\" Rouhani said.\n\n(Additional Reporting by Babak Dehghanpisheh in Dubai, Alasdair Pal and Devjyot Ghoshal in New Delhi; Writing by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Peter Graff, William Maclean)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Collections: World", "World News"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan 15 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "US News is a recognized leader in college, grad school, hospital, mutual fund, and car rankings.
