Recently, a new emerged HCoV isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (COVID-19). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security. There are some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses. The goal of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.\n\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of viruses that co-infect humans and other vertebrate animals. CoV infections affect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver, and central nervous systems of humans, livestock, birds, bats, mice, and many other wild animals [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 were both coronaviruses that transmitted from animals to humans [ 4 , 5 ]. The source of unexplained pneumonia was first discovered in Wuhan in Dec, 2019, and SARS-CoV-2, a new coronavirus, was isolated from the respiratory epithelium of patients. It belongs to a new evolutionary branch within the CoV. On Feb. 11th, 2020, the new coronavirus was officially renamed \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d from \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d [ 6 ]. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was called \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (COVID-19) [ 7 ]. According to the data released by the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China, SARS-CoV-2 was most likely transmitted from wild bats to humans, and all the above three CoVs can transmit from person to person [ 8 , 9 , 10 ]. SARS-CoV-2 shares a highly similar gene sequence and behavior pattern with SARS-CoV [ 11 ]. This paper summarized the similarities and differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, both of which cause major disease outbreaks in China and worldwide, which will provide comprehensive reference for epidemic prevention.\n\nComparative genomic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were performed by zpicture for the global comparison [ 16 ]. Multiple sequence alignment and the construction of phylogenetic trees of 38 CoVs were conducted using MEGA7 [ 17 ]. The evolutionary distances were calculated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [ 18 ].\n\nThe amino acid sequences of 28 proteins in SARS-CoV-2 were compared with those of SARS-CoV to analyze protein homology by using NCBI Blastp [ 15 ]. Proteins from SARS and SARS-CoV-2 were treated as homologous: identity value \u2265 65%, query coverage \u2265 95%.\n\nThe complete genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) [ 12 ] and two databases, including the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [ 13 ] and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) [ 14 ]. The DNA sequences of two other representative CoVs (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) were included for comparative analysis. The genomic information of latest SARS-CoV-2 strains is shown in Table S1 .\n\n3. Results\n\nThe differences and similarities of clinical characteristics between COVID-19 and SARS were summarized in .\n\nTable 1 Items SARS COVID-19 First occurrence Nov. 16th, 2002 in Foshan, Guangdong Dec. 07th, 2019 in Wuhan,\n\nHubei Pathogen SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2 Intermediate host Paguma larvata Pangolin, Mink (Possible) Definitive host Rhinolophus sinicus Rhinolophus affinis (Possible) Virus type RNA virus RNA virus Species pathogen \u03b2-coronavirus \u03b2-coronavirus Total DNA sequence length of pathogen 29,751 29,903 Latency 1\u20134 days on average 3\u20137 days on average Susceptible people Young adults People who have not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 Male\u2013female patient ratio 1:1.25 2.70:1 Mortality 9.60% 2.10% Clinical symptoms Fever, cough, myalgia, dyspnea, and diarrhea Fever, fatigue, and dry cough Propagation mode Droplets or close contacts Droplets or close contacts Major regional distribution Beijing, Guangdong, Shanxi in China Hubei, especially Wuhan in China Diagnostic methods RT-PCR, rRT-PCR, RT-LAMP, rRT-LAMP, Coronavirus detection kit RT-PCR, rRT-PCR, RT-LAMP, rRT-LAMP, Coronavirus detection kit Treatment Glucocorticoid and interferon Lopinavir/ritonavir (in testing) Open in a separate window\n\n3.1. COVID-19 and SARS\u2014the Initial Events On Nov. 27th, 2002, a respiratory illness erupted in Guangdong Province, China [19]. In Feb, 2003, the Chinese Ministry of Health announced that this acute respiratory syndrome had thus far resulted in 305 cases and five deaths [20]. The following month, there were clusters of atypical pneumonia reported in other parts of mainland China, Hong Kong [21], Canada [22], and Singapore [23]. In Jul, 2003, SARS-CoV spread across 26 countries in six continents, and caused a cumulative 8,096 cases and 774 deaths (9.6%) [24]. In particular, a higher mortality (21%) was found in hospital personnel [25,26]. On Dec. 29th, 2019, the health departments of Hubei Province received a report that four employees of the South China Seafood Wholesale Market were diagnosed with unknown-caused pneumonia in a local hospital, which was the first report of SARS-CoV-2 [27]. On Dec. 31st, 2019, the National Health Commission of People Republic of China and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) participated in the investigation and case-searching work [27]. On the same day, the government of Wuhan released information about the disease outbreaks to society [28]. Nowadays, the number of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to climb worldwide. By the date of this paper\u2019s submission, a cumulative 67,081 cases and 1,526 deaths (2.1%) were reported worldwide. In Wuhan, China, the number is 37,914. The main timeline of SARS and COVID-19 epidemic development were shown in a,b, respectively. Open in a separate window\n\n3.2. Clinical Symptoms The initial symptoms of SARS patients were fever (100%), cough (61.8%), myalgia (48.7%), dyspnea (40.8%), and diarrhea (31.6%) [29], and the prognosis of patients was associated with host characteristics (including age, gender, etc.) [30]. During hospitalization, respiratory distress occurred in 90.8% of SARS patients [29]. The duration from disease onset to severe respiratory distress was an average of 9.8 \u00b1 3.0 days [29]. During the disease course, some patients developed leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia with an upregulation of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) [29]. In comparison, COVID-19 showed similar trends with SARS patients [28]. Fever, fatigue, and dry cough are the main manifestations of the patients, while nasal congestion, runny nose, and other symptoms of the upper respiratory tract are rare. Beijing Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention indicated that the typical case of COVID-19 has a progressive aggravation process. COVID-19 can be classified into light, normal, severe, and critical types based on the severity of the disease [31]: (1) Mild cases\u2014the clinical symptoms were mild, and no pneumonia was found on the chest computed tomography (CT); (2) normal cases\u2014fever, respiratory symptoms, and patients found to have imaging manifestations of pneumonia; (3) severe cases\u2014one of the following three conditions: Respiratory distress, respiratory rate \u2265 30 times/min (in resting state, refers to oxygen saturation \u2264 93%), partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/oxygen absorption concentration (FiO2) \u2264 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa); (4) critical cases\u2014one of the following three conditions: Respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation, shock, or the associated failure of other organs requiring the intensive care unit [32]. The current clinical data shows that the majority of the deaths occurred in the older patients. However, severe cases have been documented in young adults who have unique factors, particularly those with chronic diseases, such as diabetes or hepatitis B. Those with a long-term use of hormones or immunosuppressants, and decreased immune function, are likely to get severely infected.\n\n3.3. Virus Incubation The incubation period of SARS is 1\u20134 days [33]. However, in a small number of patients, the incubation period may be longer than 10 days [34]. It has been demonstrated that the latency of COVID-19 varies from 3\u20137 days on average, for up to 14 days [35]. During this incubation period, patients are contagious, and it has been reported that each case infected on average 3.77 other people (uncertainty range 2.23-4.82) [36]. By comparison, we found that the average latency of COVID-19 is slightly longer than that of SARS.\n\n3.4. Susceptible Populations According to the demographic information of SARS patients, infection occurred in all age groups (the average age was \u226645) [37]. There was a proportional difference between male and female (female predominance) [37], with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.25 [38]. In addition, hospital staff had a higher risk due to the proximal interactions with large numbers from the infected population. For example, hospital staff accounted for 22% of all cases in Hong Kong and 22.8% in Guangdong [37]. The mortality caused by SARS increased with age (> 64 years) [37], and the overall mortality rate during the outbreak of SARS was estimated at 9.6% [39,40]. Li et al. reported that people who have not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 are all susceptible to COVID-19 [41]. Among the 8,866 patients who have been confirmed with COVID-19, nearly half of the patients have been aged 50 years or older (47.7%) [36]. The male-to-female ratio is about 2.7:1 [38] and the average incubation period is 5.2 days [42]. However, severe COVID-19 cases and deaths have mostly been in the middle-aged adults and the elderly with long smoking histories or other basic diseases, such as heart disease and hypertension [43,44]. At the time that this paper was been submitted, COVID-19 patients mortality rate was 2.1% [45].\n\n3.5. Animal Reservoirs In 2010, Shi et al. isolated a SARS-like coronavirus which was highly homologous to the SARS-CoV, confirming that Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese rufous horseshoe bat) was a natural host of the SARS-CoV [46]. Bats are known to be hosts for 30 coronaviruses based on complete genomic sequences analysis [47]. Epidemiological investigations have shown that civet cats in the wildlife market were the direct source of SARS-CoV [48]. Among the four patients with SARS discovered during the winter of 2003-2004, two were waitresses at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, and one was a customer who ate in the restaurant a short distance from a civet cage. All six civets in this cage were tested positive for SARS-CoV [48]. The new emerging SARS-CoV-2 shares about 80% of the gene sequence of SARS-CoV, released by the Military Medical Research Institute of Nanjing Military Region in 2003 [28]. Recently, Shi et al. reported that the sequence similarity of coronavirus between SARS-CoV-2 and the coronavirus isolated from Rhinolophus affinis is 96.2%, and suggested that bats may be the source of the virus [49]. So far, the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are elusive and have been reported to be snakes, minks, or variable others [50,51]. Recently, a research group of South China Agricultural University reported that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, by analyzing more than 1,000 metagenomic samples, because they found that 70% of pangolins are positive for the coronavirus. Moreover, the virus isolate from pangolin shared 99% sequence similarity with the current infected human strain SARS-CoV-2 [52]. Taking this recent research into consideration, we agreed that pangolin is more likely to be one of intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n3.6. Regional Distribution According to the WHO data on Jul. 31th, 2003 [24], a total of 8,096 clinically diagnosed cases of SARS were reported worldwide, with 774 deaths and 26 countries and regions affected ( a). Most cases were in Asia, Europe, and America. The main countries in Asia were China (including mainland, Macao, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), Singapore, and so on. The total number of cases in mainland China was 5,327, with 349 deaths [53]. The cases were mainly concentrated in Beijing, Guangdong, and Shanxi ( b) [54]. In total, 2,102 patients were from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, with 336 deaths [24]. Open in a separate window According to the latest data on Feb. 14th, 2020 [55,56], there have been a total of 67,081 clinically diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in worldwide, with 1,526 deaths. A total of 25 countries and regions have infected people. Due to the Spring Festival transportation peak, the disease has been spread more rapidly across China ( c). As the origin area of COVID-19, Hubei province has been the most severely infected area, with 54,406 cumulative diagnosis cases. Wuhan city has 37,914 cases. Guangdong, Henan, and Zhejiang province have 1,294 cases, 1,212 cases, and 1,162 cases, respectively ( d). At present, the COVID-19 outbreak has been spread to all parts of China and around the world, including the United States, Thailand, and Japan. It has been noticed that most of these patients have ever been to Wuhan or contacted with people who had been in Wuhan. The distribution of COVID-2019 patients in China (including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) and Hubei Province is shown in . Open in a separate window\n\n3.7. Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment 3.7.1. Prevention As the number of COVID-19 patients in China has been growing rapidly, preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the most important and urgent task [57]. It was shown that human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has spread via droplets or close contacts [58,59], but aerosol and fecal-oral transmission still need further study [60,61]. To reduce virus transmission, early detection and isolation are essential. In addition, close monitoring in crowded places is also important [62]. The possible pathogens of SARS and COVID-19 are both derived from wild animals [63]. Therefore, hunting, selling, and eating wild animals not only seriously damage the ecosystem, but also lead to the spread of epidemic diseases [64]. Thus, banning all wildlife trade is an effective measure to prevent viral prevalence. Wearing level-D protective clothing can protect medical staff from infection of respiratory viruses [65]. A vaccine against SARS-CoV has not been described in any published articles [66]. However, on Jan. 26th, 2020, the China CDC started to develop a new vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. The virus has been successfully isolated and seed strains have been screened [67]. 3.7.2. Diagnosis The early symptoms of SARS and COVID-19 are very similar to winter influenza, and the most important way to distinguish flu and pneumonia is to take throat swabs for viral testing [68]. Current diagnostic tests for coronavirus include RT-PCR, real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification, as well as real-time RT-LAMP [69,70,71,72]. National Medical Products Administration has approved seven new nucleic acid test reagents for coronavirus, which were developed based on fluorescence PCR by Feb. 1st, 2020 [73]. Suspected infections can be detected accurately and quickly for timely isolation and treatment to avoid infecting others by using these test reagents. 3.7.3. Treatment Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are CoVs; hence, the treatment strategies of SARS could be relevant for COVID-19 [74]. In 2003, SARS was mainly treated by isolation of the patients, hormones treatment, antiviral and symptomatic treatments, and many drugs such as glucocorticoid [29] and interferon [75]. Now, isolation, antiviral, and symptomatic treatments are still mainly adopted for COVID-19 treatment. As effective drugs for SARS, hormones and interferons can also be used to treat COVID-19 [74]. Lopinavir is one kind of protease inhibitor used to treat HIV infection, with ritonavir as a booster. Lopinavir and/or ritonavir has anti coronavirus activity in vitro. Hong Kong scholars found that, compared with ribavirin alone, patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin had lower risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death caused by SARS-CoV [76,77]. Lopinavir/ritonavir has also been clinically tested in treatment of COVID-19, and showed wonderfully effective treatment for some patients, but the general clinical effect has not been determined [78]. More effective treatments are still under continuing exploration: On Jan. 25th, 2020, a joint research team from the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Shanghai Tech University screened and identified 30 potential drugs that are reported to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 [79]. A high-resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) was announced after the outbreak of COVID-19 in the world [80], and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been treated as severe pathogens in respiratory tract infections. Nelfinavir was predicted to be a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease [81]. The first patient in the US had been trial-treated with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development) due to a severe infection [82,83]. No adverse reactions were observed during the administration, and the patient\u2019s condition was effectively improved [84]. Clinical trials of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 just started on Feb. 5th and 12th, 2020 in Wuhan and Beijing, respectively, and the experimental results remain unclear [85,86].\n\n3.8. Genomic Comparison CoVs are RNA viruses and contain the largest genomes of all RNA viruses [87]. CoVs belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family of Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales, and this subfamily includes four genera: \u03b1-coronavirus, \u03b2-coronavirus, \u03b3-coronavirus, and \u03b4-coronavirus [88]. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are in the coronavirus family, \u03b2-coronavirus genera [89]. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is more than 85% similar to the genome of the SARS-like virus ZC45 (bat-SL-CoVZC45, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"MG772933.1\",\"term_id\":\"1369125417\",\"term_text\":\"MG772933.1\"}}MG772933.1), and together these types of viruses form a unique Orthocoronavirinae subfamily with another SARS-like virus ZXC21 in the sarbecovirus subgenus [35]. All the three viruses show typical \u03b2-coronavirus gene structure. Human SARS-CoV and a genetically similar bat coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZXC21, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"MG772934\",\"term_id\":\"1369125429\",\"term_text\":\"MG772934\"}}MG772934) from southwest of China have formed another clade within the sarbecovirus [35]. We also performed comparative genomic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by zpicture. The results showed that the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have extremely high homology at the nucleotide level ( a,b). There are six regions of difference (RD) in the genome sequence between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the RDs are named according to the order of discovery. RD1, RD2, and RD3 (448nt, 55nt, and 278nt, respectively) are partial coding sequences of the orf lab gene; RD4 and RD5 (315nt and 80nt, respectively) are partial coding sequences of the S gene; RD6 is 214nt in size and is part of the coding sequence of the orf7b and orf8 genes. These RDs may provide new molecular markers for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and also help to develop new drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Open in a separate window To analyze the homogeneity of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, an evolutionary tree was constructed based on the genomes of 35 SARS-CoV-2 strains from different data submission units, one SARS-CoV strain, and two MERS-CoV strains (Figure S1). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the distance of SARS-CoV ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY274119\",\"term_id\":\"30248028\",\"term_text\":\"AY274119\"}}AY274119) is closer to SARS-CoV-2 strains than MERS-CoV ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"KC164505\",\"term_id\":\"471258596\",\"term_text\":\"KC164505\"}}KC164505, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"JX869059\",\"term_id\":\"409052551\",\"term_text\":\"JX869059\"}}JX869059).", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jiabao Xu", "Shizhe Zhao", "Tieshan Teng", "Abualgasim Elgaili Abdalla", "Wan Zhu", "Longxiang Xie", "Yunlong Wang", "Xiangqian Guo"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"ncbi_db": "pmc", "ncbi_pdid": "article", "ncbi_domain": "viruses", "ncbi_report": "record", "ncbi_type": "fulltext", "ncbi_pcid": "/articles/PMC7077191/", "ncbi_app": "pmc", "robots": "INDEX,NOFOLLOW,NOARCHIVE", "citation_journal_title": "Viruses", "citation_title": "Systematic Comparison of Two Animal-to-Human Transmitted Human Coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV", "citation_authors": "Jiabao Xu, Shizhe Zhao, Tieshan Teng, Abualgasim Elgaili Abdalla, Wan Zhu, Longxiang Xie, Yunlong Wang, Xiangqian Guo", "citation_date": "February 2020", "citation_issue": 2, "citation_volume": 12, "citation_doi": "10.3390/v12020244", "citation_abstract_html_url": "/pmc/articles/PMC7077191/?report=abstract", "citation_pmid": 32098422, "DC.Title": "Systematic Comparison of Two Animal-to-Human Transmitted Human Coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV", "DC.Type": "Text", "DC.Publisher": "Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute  (MDPI)", "DC.Contributor": "Xiangqian Guo", "DC.Date": "2020 Feb", "DC.Identifier": "10.3390/v12020244", "DC.Language": "en", "og": {"title": "Systematic Comparison of Two Animal-to-Human Transmitted Human Coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV", "type": "article", "description": "After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world in 2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections.
