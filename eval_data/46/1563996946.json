Photo: HM Treasury\n\nSelf-employed people working across theatre and the creative industries will be able to apply for 80% of their average monthly profit up to \u00a32,500, the government has announced.\n\nThe self-employed income support scheme was announced in a press briefing today (March 26) by chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak, as part of emergency measures to support those losing income due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIt follows widespread calls from organisations including BECTU, Equity, the Creative Industries Federation and Stage Directors UK for greater government support for freelances, with warnings that many would face bankruptcy without help.\n\nThe government scheme will see self-employed people who have been adversely affected by the coronavirus paid a grant worth 80% of their average monthly profit over the last three years, up to 2,500 a month.\n\nIt is open to anyone across the UK with trading profits of up to \u00a350,000 a year in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2017-18.\n\nThe scheme will be available for at least three months and those who have access to the grants are still allowed to continue to do business.\n\nThose who are recently self-employed and do not have accounts for 2018-19 will not receive any help under this scheme\n\nSunak said it would be unlikely that people would be able to access the scheme until June, and that in the meantime, self-employed people would have access to business interruption loans and the welfare system.\n\nThose who are eligible will be contacted by HMRC and the grant will be paid directly into their bank accounts.\n\nThe Creative Industries Federation welcomed the measures as a \u201cvictory for the creative industries\u201d, however warned there needs to be more immediately accessible support.\n\nChief executive Caroline Norbury said: \u201cAlthough the measures announced today are welcome, it is vital that they are implemented as a matter of urgency, and certainly much quicker than the proposed timeline of June \u2013 two months later than those on payroll.\n\n\u201cSelf-employed workers have outgoings and business expenses due immediately, which \u00a394.25 a week in Universal Credit payments simply will not cover. They cannot wait three months to be paid.\n\n\u201cIt is vital that government implements an interim basic income for the self-employed, until the scheme is fully operational.\u201d\n\nHead of Bectu Philippa Childs said: \u201cBectu has pushed incredibly hard for freelances and the self-employed to have parity with employees and the scale of the chancellor\u2019s announcement clearly sets out to achieve that.\n\n\u201cHowever, we won\u2019t stop and there are still many details to work through including how those who have paid themselves through dividends will fit into this scheme and also the time-scale.\n\n\u201cWe know that the benefits system is under intense pressure with a five week wait for payments to be made and the self-employed and freelancers should have access to the coronavirus business interruption loans made available by the government.\u201d\n\nEquity general secretary Christine Payne welcomed the scheme, adding: \u201cWe look forward to offering our advice and assistance as the details of this scheme are worked out and hope that it can be brought online quicker than is anticipated.\n\n\u201cOur priority going forward will be to ensure that as many members as possible can access the scheme, including those whose profits have been reduced by the legitimate expenses incurred in the course of their work.\u201d\n\nThe Incorporated Society of Musicians also welcomed the measures, and said it will be \u201clooking closely at the package and advising [its] members and the wider music sector in due course.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["coronavirus", "Edinburgh"], "authors": ["Giverny Masso", "Matthew Hemley", "Georgia Snow"], "publish_date": "Thu Mar 26 17:55:09 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Self-employed people are to be paid 80% of their average monthly profit up to \u00a32,500 by the government as an emergency measure to support those who are experiencing loss of income due to the Covid-19 pandemic.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.thestage.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/The-Stage-favicon2.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 7383655823}, "referrer": "always", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.thestage.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/16120733/Rishi-Sunak.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.thestage.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/16120733/Rishi-Sunak.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 455}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Coronavirus: Self-employed to be paid 80% of average monthly profit by government", "description": "Self-employed people are to be paid 80% of their average monthly profit up to \u00a32,500 by the government as an emergency measure to support those who are experiencing loss of income due to the Covid-19 pandemic.", "url": "https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2020/coronavirus-self-employed-to-be-paid-80-of-average-monthly-profit-by-government/", "site_name": "The Stage", "updated_time": "2020-03-26T18:25:02+00:00"}, "description": "Self-employed people are to be paid 80% of their average monthly profit up to \u00a32,500 by the government as an emergency measure to support those who are experiencing loss of income due to the Covid-19 pandemic.", "news_keywords": "coronavirus", "original-source": "https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2020/coronavirus-self-employed-to-be-paid-80-of-average-monthly-profit-by-government/", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thestage", "tag": "coronavirus", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-03-26T17:55:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-26T18:25:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Self-employed people are to be paid 80% of their average monthly profit up to \u00a32,500 by the government as an emergency measure to support those who are experiencing loss of income due to the Covid-19 pandemic.", "title": "Coronavirus: Self-employed to be paid 80% of average monthly profit by government", "site": "@TheStage", "image": "https://cdn.thestage.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/16120733/Rishi-Sunak.jpg", "creator": "@TheStage"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.thestage.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/22103103/cropped-siteicon-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2020/coronavirus-self-employed-to-be-paid-80-of-average-monthly-profit-by-government/"}
