For years Iran did not see the United States as a credible threat because under President Obama\u2014we weren\u2019t. Now, we have a President who understands what so many service members know: actions run risks, but inaction returns more consequences in the long run.\u201d\n\n###", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Jan  3 15:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://watkins.house.gov/profiles/congress/themes/custom/congress_omega/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "og": {"site_name": "Congressman Steve Watkins", "type": "article", "url": "https://watkins.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-steve-watkins-death-qasem-soleimani", "title": "Congressman Steve Watkins on Death of Qasem Soleimani", "updated_time": "2020-01-03T15:19:15-05:00", "image": "https://watkins.house.gov/sites/watkins.house.gov/files/featured_image/CSW%20logo%20w_white%20background.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-03T15:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-03T15:19:15-05:00"}}, "canonical_link": "https://watkins.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-steve-watkins-death-qasem-soleimani"}
