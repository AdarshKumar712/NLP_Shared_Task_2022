The coalition of buyers formed an affiliate, Sparc Group F21 LLC, in filing the plan that sets the minimum sale price for the retailer.\n\nUnder the terms of the bid, the buyers can close certain stores and conduct going-out-of-business sales. If the sale doesn\u2019t proceed, they may also be entitled to a $4.65 million break-up fee under some circumstances.\n\nLos Angeles-based Forever 21 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September, releasing a list of 178 stores it would close in the U.S. and announcing that it was leaving operations entirely in 40 countries, including Canada and Japan.\n\n\u201cThis was an important and necessary step to secure the future of our company, which will enable us to reorganize our business and reposition Forever 21,\u201d said Linda Chang, executive vice president of Forever 21, in a statement announcing the Chapter 11 filing.\n\nDelaware has three Forever 21 locations, one each at the Christiana Mall, Dover Mall and Rehoboth Beach\u2019s Tanger Outlets. The latter was included on a list of the 178 locations that the company could close, although it noted that those decisions were subject to lease or rent negotiations.\n\nForever 21, which targeted women ages 25 to 40 with its clothing and accessories, hit trouble in recent years after it expanded storefronts aggressively as e-commerce began to grow as a disrupting factor. With frequently changing merchandise, the company depended on customers returning often to buy items primarily costing $50 or less.\n\nE-commerce made up only 16% of its sales, as of last year, according to officials. The company saw its revenue drop by about 25% to $3.3 billion in 2018, down from $4.4 billion in 2016. It expects the restructured company to bring in $2.5 billion in annual sales.\n\nThe company was able to stay afloat through its bankruptcy case via $275 in financing from JPMorgan Chase Bank, as well as a $75 million capital influx from TPG Sixth Street Partners. It has said in recent reports that it is running low on cash, however, and may be forced to liquidate if a buyer isn\u2019t found soon.\n\nThe $81.1 million bid will be declared the winner unless another bid comes in. If so, an auction will be held on Feb. 10 with a winner declared by Feb. 11, according to court filings.\n\nSimon and Brookfield are among the mall owners with the most at stake in Forever 21, with their malls featuring 99 and 85 stores, respectively. It\u2019s not their first time attempting to rescue a major tenant as the two teamed up in 2016 to rescue teen apparel retailer Aeropostale in its bankruptcy case.\n\nBy Jacob Owens\n\n[email protected]", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Simon Property Group", "Dover Mall", "Brookfield Property Partners", "Forever 21", "Christiana Mall", "Tanger Outlets"], "authors": ["Roger Kirtley", "Rich Shaw", "Steve Masterson"], "publish_date": "Wed Feb  5 19:00:08 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners, along with Atlantic Brands Group, have submitted a bid of $81.1 million for Forever 21.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.todaymediainc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/DBT-favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners, along with Atlantic Brands Group, have submitted a bid of $81.1 million for Forever 21.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mall owners seek to buy Forever 21 from bankruptcy - Delaware Business Times", "description": "Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners, along with Atlantic Brands Group, have submitted a bid of $81.1 million for Forever 21.", "url": "https://delawarebusinesstimes.com/news/forever-21-bankruptcy-buy/", "site_name": "Delaware Business Times", "image": "https://cdn.todaymediainc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/Forever21Markville2-394x218.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-05T19:00:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-09T19:05:34+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/DBTjowens", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Jacob Owens", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.todaymediainc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/Forever21Markville2-394x218.jpg"}}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "facebook-domain-verification": "27xo0hba1ciauk0b4mkmglv5jkimpr", "framework": "Redux 4.2.14", "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "https://delawarebusinesstimes.com", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.todaymediainc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/DBT-favicon.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://delawarebusinesstimes.com/news/forever-21-bankruptcy-buy/"}
