Mr. Floyd\u2019s death was tragic, unnecessary, and totally preventable.\u201d\n\nHe also announced the creation of a subcommittee of chiefs and community leaders to submit solutions to the Florida Legislature.\n\n\u201cThe problems and issues facing our nation that led to this tragedy are varied and complex, and deeply entrenched in the very fabric of our society, but we cannot let this happen again. We can and must be better,\u201d he said.\n\nChauvin, a white police officer now charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, is the officer at the center of a national outcry over Floyd\u2019s death. Footage on social media showed Chauvin pin the now-deceased black man\u2019s neck with his knee before Floyd went unresponsive.\n\nBut protesters have called for the other three officers on the scene during Floyd\u2019s arrest to be charged as well.\n\n\u201cNo law enforcement training \u2014 no policies \u2014 support what happened to Mr. Floyd,\u201d Albano said. \u201cThe other officers who chose not to act and stop Officer Chauvin from killing Mr. Floyd as he repeatedly cried out for help are also complicit, and they showed an appalling lack of personal courage. The actions and conduct of all the officers involved were totally reprehensible and not in keeping with the high standards of conduct demanded by our profession.\u201d\n\nAlbano lauded Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo for quickly firing the four officers and demanded accountability for Floyd\u2019s death and an end to looting and rioting across the nation.\n\n\u201cTo borrow Chief Arradondo\u2019s own words when he was sworn in, the ultimate goal for all law enforcement leaders is a community that trusts us, that views us as the guardians of our communities.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["George Floyd", "Florida Police Chiefs Association", "Minneapolis", "Medaria Arradondo", "Minnesota", "FPCA", "Derek Chauvin", "Kenneth Albano"], "authors": ["Older Woman", "Mike Irvine", "Sonja Fitch"], "publish_date": "Mon Jun  1 23:32:36 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The association is also creating a subcommittee to suggest solutions to the Florida Legislature.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@RenzoDowney", "site": "@Fla_Pol", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Renzo Downey", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "og": {"title": "Florida Police Chiefs Association condemns officers for role in George Floyd's death", "type": "article", "url": "https://floridapolitics.com/archives/337301-florida-police-chiefs-association-condemns-officers-for-role-in-george-floyds-death", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The association is also creating a subcommittee to suggest solutions to the Florida Legislature.", "site_name": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.
