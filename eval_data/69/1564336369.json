We understand that our youth and adults need language to share their experience. We commend the usage of \u201cChristians who experience same-sex attraction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to communicate our love for the many within the Church who live with same-sex attraction. We understand that not everyone will agree with our conclusions. We pray that many will recognize our commitment to biblical orthodoxy and our loving pastoral concern for the people of God.\u201d\n\nThe bishops deferred to diocesan bishops to discern same-sex matters within their own diocesan communities and ministries.\n\nThe Anglican leader in Nigeria called for sanctions against the bishops, priests and laity in ACNA Province who signed the letter.\n\nNdukuba said the letter had brought the Church to ridicule on biblical teachings about Christian marriage and human sexuality.\n\nThe bishop noted that the ACNA statement was similar to the action by The Episcopal Church (TEC) before if fully endorsed same-sex unions, including among ordained clergy.\n\nNdukuba thanked Archbishop Foley Beach\u2019s intervention \u201cby which the offensive gay Anglican letter was removed from the web\u201d.\n\nHe, however, complained that the removal \u201chas not cured the diseases that have set in, neither has it mitigated the damage this has done by the public advertisement and the changing perception of the ACNA stand on Biblical orthodoxy.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Gay is a Gay, they cannot be rightly described otherwise. We cannot describe people as \u2018Christian Murderer\u2019, Christian Adulterer\u2019 and \u2018Christian terrorist\u2019; neither should we even have \u2018Gay Christian\u2019 or \u2018Gay Anglican.\u201d\n\nPrimate Ndukuba further stressed that no man shall see God without holiness.\n\nThe cleric urged the ACNA to take a clear stand on homosexuality and same-sex relations.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Apostle Suleiman", "china", "Covid-19"], "authors": ["Seun Opejobi", "Wale Odunsi", "Amos Tauna"], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 31 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministries, on Tuesday, called on China to cancel all debts owed it over the Coronavirus pandemic.
