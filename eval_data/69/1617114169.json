in nursing homes in Ontario and Quebec, though 36 members of the Canadian Forces have come down with COVID-19 while doing so.\n\nThat\u2019s up from 28 cases of the novel coronavirus among those troops less than a week ago.\n\nThe military has been deployed to nursing homes in the two provinces to reinforce workers overwhelmed by the illness, unable to keep up with residents\u2019 needs because of all the protective measures they need to take, or off work because they\u2019re ill themselves.\n\nFourteen of the military members with COVID-19 are in Ontario and 22 of them are in Quebec.\n\nWhen the Forces started reporting the number of positive cases, they said they\u2019d update the figures every two weeks but have revised that plan to give new numbers every day.\n\nTrudeau says the premiers of Ontario and Quebec have both asked for the military to extend the deployment and he expects to agree.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Canadian Forces", "military",
