We love the noise,\u201d Windward\u2019s Juju Watkins said. \u201cWe were thinking we were not going to give this up. We worked so hard and we\u2019ve been through so much.\u201d\n\nWatkins, just a freshman, scored 12 of her 20 points in the fourth quarter, coming up clutch when Windward needed her most.\n\n\u201cShe has big-game blood,\u201d Windward coach Vanessa Nygaard said. \u201cShe\u2019s learning a lot. It\u2019s easy to forget that she is still just a freshman and she makes errors, but she has got something special.\u201d\n\nSierra Canyon (25-7) led 57-47 with 5:20 left in the game, but Windward took its first lead 58-57 on two free throws by Watkins with 3:07 left.\n\nMcKayla Williams added 16 points for Windard, and Maya Stokes came off the bench to contribute a 12-point performance.\n\n\u201cWe showed our heart,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe lost by two earlier in the year, and we really wanted it. We were in a huddle late in the third quarter, and we realized we could hit that switch. One stop at a time.\u201d\n\nSierra Canyon coach Alicia Komaki praised her team for its performance and execution.\n\n\u201cEveryone who played should have no regrets,\u201d Komaki said. \u201cThey followed the game plan. The defense was fantastic. We always play hard and we always play with passion and always do things the right way. Our seniors played to win and we left it all on the floor.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re so confused. When we play really well like this, we always end up on the right side of the win column. We didn\u2019t tonight.\u201d\n\nWindward went to a triangle-and-two to slow down Ashley Chevalier and Vanessa DeJesus of Sierra Canyon.\n\nChevalier scored 10 first-quarter points and had 21 points at halftime, but she was limited to four second-half points.\n\nStill, the reigning Daily News Player of the Year delivered one of her best performances of the season, pushing the pace and giving her team an early surge in her 25-point performance.\n\n\u201cIt was my last game as a senior, and I was going to do everything I could to help the team,\u201d Chevalier said. \u201cIt felt like I finally came into myself. This felt like me for the first time in a long time.\u201d\n\nAlexis Mark scored 11 points for Sierra Canyon. DeJesus scored seven points, and Vanessa Smart had six points for Sierra Canyon.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Health", "Corrections", "Endorsements", "Jobs", "Investigative Reporting"], "authors": ["Tony Ciniglio", "Correspondent", "Southern California News Group"], "publish_date": "Wed Mar  4 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/site-icon-ladn.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"application-name": "dailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "wp-parsely_version": "1.14", "fb": {"pages": 55107646487}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Sierra Canyon girls basketball derailed in regionals by Windward\u2019s stunning comeback", "url": "https://www.dailynews.com/sierra-canyon-girls-basketball-derailed-in-regionals-by-windwards-stunning-comeback", "description": "Windward overcomes a 10-point deficit with five minutes left to end the season for Sierra Canyon in the first round of the SoCal Regional playoffs.", "site_name": "Daily News", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LDN-L-PREP-SC-GBB-0305_9-1.jpg?w=1024&h=675", "width": 1024, "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-05T06:12:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-05T06:12:27+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ladailynews", "text": {"title": "Sierra Canyon girls basketball derailed in regionals by Windward\u2019s stunning comeback"}, "image": "https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LDN-L-PREP-SC-GBB-0305_9-1.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/site-icon-ladn.png?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.dailynews.com/sierra-canyon-girls-basketball-derailed-in-regionals-by-windwards-stunning-comeback"}
