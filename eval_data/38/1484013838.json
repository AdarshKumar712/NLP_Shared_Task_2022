Today Guardians Of The Galaxy is hailed as one of the best movies that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has spawned, but before its 2014 release, it was considered one of Marvel\u2019s riskiest endeavors. Not only was it arguably a lot weirder than anything the MCU had attempted before, but Guardians Of The Galaxy was also adapted from a relatively obscure comic book series about a relatively unknown team of superheroes.\n\nLuckily for Marvel, Peter Quill and his motley crew proved a big hit with audiences and Guardians Of The Galaxy went on to rank as 2014\u2019s third highest-grossing film. The James Gunn-directed movie got a sequel \u2013 Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 \u2013 in 2017 and since then the GOTG team has appeared in other MCU movies like Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.\n\nContinue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view.\n\nRelated: Is Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 On Netflix?\n\nWith a third Guardians Of The Galaxy film right around the corner, no doubt those new or old to the MCU will want to re-watch the first movie but is it available on Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime? Unfortunately, Netflix and Hulu members are out of luck as Guardians Of The Galaxy isn\u2019t available via either streaming service. The movie is, however, on Amazon Prime to rent or buy and currently priced between $2.99 and $19.99 to watch in standard definition or HD.\n\nThe reason behind Guardians Of The Galaxy\u2019s absence on Netflix is the launch of the House of Mouse\u2019s new streaming service Disney+ in November 2019. Disney has been steadily removing its Marvel movies from Netflix in anticipation of the Disney+ launch for the past couple of years. So, while Guardians Of The Galaxy isn\u2019t available on Netflix it is on Disney+ alongside its sequel Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 and a ton of other Marvel titles including Ant-Man, Doctor Strange and Captain Marvel. Other options for watching Guardians Of The Galaxy include YouTube Movies, Google Play, iTunes and the Microsoft Store where the film is easily available to rent or buy.\n\nWhile Guardians Of The Galaxy may be unavailable for Netflix and Hulu subscribers, there\u2019s still the upcoming release of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 3. to look forward to. The sequel is set to commence production once director James Gunn has finished working on the DCEU movie The Suicide Squad and is currently scheduled for release in 2021.\n\nNext: The Marvel/DC War is Over, Thanks to James Gunn\n\nShare Tweet Email", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Guardians Of The Galaxy", "guardians of the galaxy", "Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2", "Ant-Man", "Captain Marvel", "Avengers: Infinity War", "The Suicide Squad", "Avengers: Endgame", "Doctor Strange", "Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 3."], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 07:01:26 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Guardians Of The Galaxy is one of the best-loved movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but is it available to watch on Netflix, Hulu or Prime?", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/public/build/images/favicon-32x32.3fd37a19.png", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "description": "Guardians Of The Galaxy is one of the best-loved movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but is it available to watch on Netflix, Hulu or Prime?", "og": {"title": "Is Guardians Of The Galaxy On Netflix, Hulu Or Prime?", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Guardians-Of-The-Galaxy-.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://screenrant.com/guardians-of-galaxy-watch-online-netflix-hulu-prime/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Here\u2019s whether Guardians Of The Galaxy is on Netflix, Hulu and Prime.", "site_name": "ScreenRant"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T07:01:26Z", "section": "SR Originals"}, "fb": {"app_id": 822150531210883}}, "canonical_link": "https://screenrant.com/guardians-of-galaxy-watch-online-netflix-hulu-prime/"}
