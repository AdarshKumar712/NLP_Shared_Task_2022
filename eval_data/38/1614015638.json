sport will disappear when Phase 2 begins.\n\nThe Health Minister, Salvador Illa, insists that an exclusive time slot for vulnerable groups must be maintained and says it will be up to the Communities or Municipalities to manage that.\n\nThe Canary Islands of El Hierro, La Gomera and La Graciosa and Formentera in the Balearic Islands are already in phase 2.\n\nThe rest of the Canaries, Majorca, Ibiza and Minorca in the Balearics, Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Navarra, Euskadi, La Rioja, Aragon, Extremadura, Andalusia, Murcia, Ceuta and Melilla, part of Catalonia, the Castilian-Manchegan Provinces of Cuenca and Guadalajara, and the rural areas of Castilla y Le\u00f3n all hope to progress to Phase 2 on Monday.\n\nLast Saturday, the Official State Gazette, or BOE relaxed the restrictions on those under 70 years of age, making it possible for them to exercise outside at any time of the day, except from 1000-1200 and 1900-2000 which is reserved exclusively for seniors and those most vulnerable to Covid-19.\n\nMinister Illa has indicated that the restrictions on bars, restaurants and shops may be relaxed slightly allowing capacity to be increased from 40% to 50%.\n\nFernando Sim\u00f3n, the Director of the Centre for the Coordination of Health Alerts & Emergencies, agreed that \"the time slots should disappear in phase 2\" and proposed that \"an exclusive band be maintained for vulnerable groups.\" He also said it should be up to the Communities and Municipalities that progress to phase 2 to manage it.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Mallorca
