Chief Mathema asserts that the move promotes looting of national resources.\n\nHe said:\n\nThe repeal of the Indigenisation Act put in place by Mugabe\u2019s regime has sent CSOTs into extinction.\n\nWe have decided to form an association to share ideas on how we can survive now that we no longer have the government support and that of companies which are looting our resources.\n\nThe Indigenisation Act had resulted in the establishment of community share ownership trusts to ensure that the indigenous communities benefited from national resources with minerals topping the agenda.\n\nZimbabwe was not the first country to have such a policy as the USA, China, France, Italy, Brazil, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Taiwan and South Africa still have such policies in various forms which might not be as direct as the compulsory 51/49 shareholding adopted by Zimbabwe.-The Standard", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Mar 16 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.zimeye.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/zimeye.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.zimeye.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emmerson-Mnangagwa-768x432-1.jpg"}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.zimeye.net/2020/03/16/traditional-leader-openly-criticizes-mnangagwa/"}
