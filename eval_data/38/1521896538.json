Bayelsa Governor-Elect, Sen. Douye Diri and Deputy, have been sworn in as Governor and Deputy Governor of Bayelsa in Yenagoa. The Supreme Court has spoken. Bayelsans have moved on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI salute the Courage of @MBuhari for refusing to interfere with the judiciary.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Latest News in Nigeria"], "authors": ["Motunrayo Ogundipe"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Buhari refused to interfere with the judgment of the Supreme Court in Bayelsa state \u2013 Presidency", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "http://www.nigerianeye.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"generator": "blogger", "og": {"url": "http://www.nigerianeye.com/2020/02/buhari-refused-to-interfere-with.html", "title": "Nigerian News.
