Things got complicated, however, when the bride-to-be messaged her with a strange request.\n\nReddit user ClockworkMoose shared their story to the site\u2019s forums. She explained that after getting several RSVPs to a stranger\u2019s wedding, she received an email from the bride-to-be, who shared the same first name as her. The bride-to-be said ClockworkMoose would have to give up her email account.\n\nThe story continues, \u201cI reply to that, no, and also, why? I get an email back in about 10 minutes. She says that she's got the same first name as me, and is getting married to a guy (with the same last name as ClockworkMoose). They've picked (ClockworkMoose\u2019s real name) as their email account for RSVPs. She didn't realize I made the account, so I can either give my password to her or I can reset it and she can create a new one, whichever works for me!\u201d\n\nBRIDE, GROOM EXPECT GUESTS TO SIT THROUGH TIMESHARE PRESENTATION AS PART OF DESTINATION WEDDING\n\nWhen the post\u2019s author says she declined to give up her email account, the bride-to-be responded angrily and claimed that ClockworkMoose was ruining her life and wedding.\n\nClockworkMoose says she eventually figured out that the bride-to-be sent out her wedding invitations with the email address on them, unaware it was already taken. Unable to recall all of the invitations, the bride-to-be seemed determined to take over the email account.\n\nAfter several angry emails, ClockworkMoose says she responded and offered to forward the RSVPs to the bride\u2019s actual email address. \u201cShe sends back a nasty email full of expletives and name-calling again demanding my password or nothing,\u201d she wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nSince then, a seemingly fed up ClockworkMoose says she\u2019s been responding to RSVPs by telling people they\u2019re not invited to her wedding. \u201cThis has the benefit of being 100 percent true, albeit deceptive,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSurprisingly, this doesn\u2019t seem to be an isolated incident. Several commenters responded by sharing similar stories that they had to deal with.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nOne user wrote, \u201cConsidering that something similar to the original poster\u2019s story has happened to me not once but thrice, it's somewhat surprising how common this attitude is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a similar encounter with an Instagram account,\u201d replied another user. \u201c\u2019FirstnameMiddlename\u2019 and some idiot had the nerve to DM me and ask me to change mine so she could have it. At least this one was a kid/teen so I brushed her off but it baffles me when grown adults do this.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnother user chimed in, \u201cI got it on Twitter once. It was some person that basically said I stole their identity by having the handle I had, and I had to give it to them. I pointed out I had been on Twitter a lot longer than them, and I wasn't changing. Has to be kids thinking they can just demand something they want.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Michael Hollan"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Brides can make a lot of demands when it comes to their wedding day, but this might be taking things a little too far.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Brides can make a lot of demands when it comes to their wedding day, but this might be taking things a little too far.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "lifestyle", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Michael Hollan", "dc.title": "Bride-to-be puts stranger's email address on invitations, demands to be given account", "dcterms.abstract": "Brides can make a lot of demands when it comes to their wedding day, but this might be taking things a little too far.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Brides can make a lot of demands when it comes to their wedding day, but this might be taking things a little too far.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:0f1534bd-f589-5334-990b-2d54cd454bfa", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2020-02-16", "dcterms.created": "2020-02-16T14:20:13-05:00", "dcterms.modified": "2020-02-16T15:11:07-05:00", "og": {"title": "Bride-to-be puts stranger's email address on invitations, demands to be given account", "description": "Brides can make a lot of demands when it comes to their wedding day, but this might be taking things a little too far.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/02/angry-bride-on-phone.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bride-demands-strangers-email-address-rsvp", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Bride-to-be puts stranger's email address on invitations, demands to be given account", "description": "Brides can make a lot of demands when it comes to their wedding day, but this might be taking things a little too far.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/02/1024/512/angry-bride-on-phone.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bride-demands-strangers-email-address-rsvp"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/LIFESTYLE/Bridezillas,/FOX NEWS/LIFESTYLE,/FOX NEWS/LIFESTYLE/Weddings", "classification-isa": "bridezillas,lifestyle,weddings"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bride-demands-strangers-email-address-rsvp"}
