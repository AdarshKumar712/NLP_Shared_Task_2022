Sign up here.\n\nMichigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s administration has requested an emergency supply of the drugs President Trump touted as having success treating patients with severe symptoms of the novel coronavirus, in a reversal from the state's directive to medical professionals last week to avoid the medication for this purpose.\n\nMichigan, this week, requested hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile for physicians to use to help treat patients with COVID-19, after the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend granted an emergency use authorization for the anti-malarial drugs.\n\nFDA OKs EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION OF DRUGS TOUTED BY TRUMP TO FIGHT COVID-19\n\nBut last week, Whitmer\u2019s administration threatened physicians prescribing the drugs, saying they were subject to \u201cadministrative action\u201d should they continue to use the medication.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs has received multiple allegations of Michigan physicians inappropriately prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to themselves, family, friends, and/or coworkers without a legitimate medical purpose,\u201d Deb Gagliardi, the director of the Bureau of Professional Licensing, and Forrest Pasanski, the director of the Enforcement Division, wrote in a letter to \u201clicensed prescribers and dispensers.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine without further proof of efficacy for treating COVID-19 or with the intent to stockpile the drug may create a shortage\u201d for those patients who need the drug for its approved use, adding that \u201creports of this conduct will be evaluated and may be further investigated for administrative action.\n\n\u201cAgain, these drugs have not been proven scientifically or medically to treat COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cMichigan pharmacists may see an increased volume of prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and should take special care to evaluate the prescriptions\u2019 legitimacy,\u201d they continued, warning again that \u201clicensed health professionals are required to report inappropriate prescribing practices.\u201d\n\nMichigan wasn\u2019t the only state last week to threaten physicians using the drugs\u2014Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak\u2019s administration also restricted the prescription of the medication, after a man died and his wife was hospitalized for using a fish tank cleaning additive with a similar name as a substitute.\n\n\"While the two drugs have necessary medical purposes, there is no conclusive evidence at this time among COVID-19 experts or Nevada's own medical health advisory team that the drugs provide treatment for COVID-19 patients,\" Sisolak said in a statement last week.\n\nBut Michigan reversed course, requesting a supply of the medications for physicians to use in treating patients of COIVD-19, after the Department of Health and Human Services received and accepted donations of the medications to the national stockpile to be used for coronavirus treatment.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is taking every possible step to protect Americans from the coronavirus and provide them with hope,\u201d HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. \u201cScientists in America and around the world have identified multiple potential therapeutics for COVID-19, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe President\u2019s bold leadership and the hard work of FDA and HHS\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response have succeeded in securing this large donation of medicine. We\u2019ll continue working around the clock to get American patients access to therapeutics that may help them battle COVID-19, while building the evidence to evaluate which options are effective.\u201d\n\nThe FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization allows hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the national stockpile \u201cto be distributed and prescribed by doctors to hospitalized teen and adult patients with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible.\u201d\n\nWHITMER SAYS STATES ARE IN A BIDDING WAR OVER MEDICAL SUPPLIES AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nHydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate are oral prescription drugs approved to treat malaria and other diseases. HHS says there currently are no approved treatments for COVID-19, but that both drugs have \u201cshown activity in laboratory studies against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).\u201d\n\n\u201cAnecdotal reports suggest that these drugs may offer some benefit in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients,\u201d HHS said in a statement. \u201cClinical trials are needed to provide scientific evidence that these treatments are effective.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Whitmer, who has been a fierce critic of the president, said last week that states are being forced to bid with one another for personal protective equipment (PPE) and, in some cases, contracts in place have been set aside, delayed or canceled and the goods are instead going to the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe the states are trying to actively get every piece of PPE that we can. We're bidding against one another and, in some cases, the federal government is taking priority,\u201d she said.\n\nWhitmer added: \u201cWe've got to keep working to get all of these other pieces of equipment and when we're bidding against one another, it's creating a lot of frustration and concern.\u201d\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the U.S. reported more than 216,700 positive cases of COVID-19 and more than 5,130 deaths.\n\nFox News' Andrew O'Reilly, Ryan Gaydos, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Brooke Singman"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Michigan Democratic Gov.
