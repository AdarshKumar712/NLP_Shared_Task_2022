Thanos' defeat leaves the door open for another big Marvel villain to take his place; however, this formidable character is an enormously difficult act to follow. Thanos had been set up for six years as the primary foe of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ever since he turned around to deliver a grin during the credits of the first Avengers. Since then, his powerful nature in-universe had been made abundantly clear, especially after he actually pulled off his evil plan at the end of Avengers: Infinity War.\n\nContinue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view.\n\nAfter all of that hype and subsequent mayhem caused by Thanos, how exactly can the MCU deliver future villains that can measure up to this iconic foe? Well, the very defeat of that character could help open up the door for subsequent powerful adversaries to emerge over future Marvel Cinematic Universe titles. Considering things from the perspective of in-universe supervillains, a powerful figure like Thanos being completely off the table now leaves an opening for new foes to take his place. Nefarious individuals previously petrified to deal with Thanos and his gauntlet now have their chance to step out of the shadows and conquer the world.\n\nRelated: Marvel Provides More Evidence Thanos Is Alive After Endgame\n\nThe writers crafting the next wave of MCU storylines need to look at Thanos as a figure whose power kept equally formidable antagonists at bay. His defeat has left a power vacuum in the universe. Dormammu, The Mandarin, and even Doctor Doom (who Marvel again has the film rights to), can all now step-up to the plate as towering villainous forces because they don't have to contend with Thanos and all of his might. Marvel superheroes like Thor couldn't have been the only ones intimidated by Thanos \u2014 whose to say previously-unseen supervillains weren't also terrified of this purple beast?\n\nMCU Villains That Could Follow Thanos\n\nOf course, such fear has now been removed from the hearts of supervillains all across the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Avengers taking out Thanos took out one threat, but it's easy to see that victory opening up the door for a whole avalanche of new threats to emerge. One could easily see Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness featuring a version of Dormammu that, in the wake of Thanos being defeated, sees a chance for himself to garner heretofore unknown levels of power. Similarly, there's a whole slew of powerful villains whose film rights were previously owned exclusively by 20th Century Fox, such as the Fantastic Four property, that could emerge in the wake of Thanos' demise.\n\nWouldn't it be a logical extension of Thanos being taken down for Galactus, now having to face one less challenger, to emerge as a multi-film baddie whose power dwarfs even those utilized by Thanos? The sheer power possessed by Thanos, as well as his pop-culture ubiquity, puts a great level of pressure on those tasked with creating future powerful villains for members of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to face. But every ending is somebody else's beginning, and it's easy to see an outcome where the demise of Thanos at the end of Avengers: Endgame is an impetus for even greater supervillains to follow.\n\nNext: The Human Torch Exists In The MCU (But Not The Fantastic 4 Version)\n\nShare Tweet Email\n\nStar Trek Picard: How The New Series Can Avoid Voyager\u2019s Mistakes", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Avengers: Endgame", "Avengers: Infinity War", "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness", "Marvel Cinematic Universe"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 09:01:19 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Thanos was defeated in Avengers: Endgame, the Infinity Saga finale, so the MCU phase 4 will introduce the next big Marvel villains.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/public/build/images/favicon-32x32.3fd37a19.png", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "description": "Thanos was defeated in Avengers: Endgame, the Infinity Saga finale, so the MCU phase 4 will introduce the next big Marvel villains.", "og": {"title": "Thanos' Defeat Leaves The Door Open For Bigger MCU Villains", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Thanos-Defeated-Mystery-custom.jpg", "width": 1400, "height": 700}, "url": "https://screenrant.com/thanos-defeat-new-mcu-phase-4-villains-bigger/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The defeat of Thanos at the end of Avengers: Endgame leaves an opening in the MCU for one of Marvel's other big villains to rise to power.", "site_name": "ScreenRant"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-01T09:01:19Z", "section": "SR Originals"}, "fb": {"app_id": 822150531210883}}, "canonical_link": "https://screenrant.com/thanos-defeat-new-mcu-phase-4-villains-bigger/"}
