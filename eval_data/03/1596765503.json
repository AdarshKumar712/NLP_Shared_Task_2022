The trooper located the vehicle, a Chevrolet Impala, traveling eastbound and speeding near Wood River at mile marker 299. The trooper was able to confirm that the vehicle was stolen and attempted a traffic stop, but the vehicle fled at a high rate of speed.\n\nThe trooper initiated a pursuit. During the pursuit, the suspect vehicle reached speeds of more than 125 miles per hour. At mile marker 318, another trooper was able to successfully deploy spike strips to bring the suspect vehicle to stop.\n\nA 17-year-old male was immediately taken into custody. He was cited for theft of a motor vehicle, operating a vehicle to avoid arrest, willful reckless driving, no operator\u2019s license, and several traffic violations. The juvenile was lodged at the Kearney YRTC.\n\nThree juvenile escapees remain at large. Anyone with information about these juveniles should contact Kearney Police at 308-237-2104, the Buffalo County Sheriff\u2019s Office at 308-236-8555, or the Nebraska State Patrol Troop C at 308-385-6000.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Troopers arrest escaped YRTC Juvenile following pursuit"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Press Release"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Troopers with the Nebraska State Patrol have arrested a juvenile, who had escaped from the Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center in Kearney, following a pursuit near Grand Island.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//media.graytvinc.com/designimages/228*228/FaviconKSNB.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "language": "english", "og": {"title": "Troopers arrest escaped YRTC Juvenile following pursuit", "description": "Troopers with the Nebraska State Patrol have arrested a juvenile, who had escaped from the Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center in Kearney, following a pursuit near Grand Island.", "type": "article", "image": "https://media.graytvinc.com/images/Cop+Lights+33.jpg", "url": "https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/Troopers-arrest-escaped-YRTC-Juvenile-following-pursuit-570182961.html"}, "description": "Troopers with the Nebraska State Patrol have arrested a juvenile, who had escaped from the Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center in Kearney, following a pursuit near Grand Island.", "author": "Press Release", "application-name": "", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "//media.graytvinc.com/designimages/144*144/FaviconKSNB.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//media.graytvinc.com/designimages/70*70/FaviconKSNB.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//media.graytvinc.com/designimages/270*270/FaviconKSNB.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//media.graytvinc.com/designimages/310*310/FaviconKSNB.png", "google-site-verification": "umN3f3RLexaBuxZ23ohEbSs3ooJLAOuJDCS6b3KBQJ0", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "fb": {"app_id": 982572328491018, "pages": 298676190333479}, "news_keywords": "Troopers arrest escaped YRTC Juvenile", "keywords": "Troopers arrest escaped YRTC Juvenile following pursuit", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NBCNebraska", "creator": "@NBCNebraska", "url": "https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/Troopers-arrest-escaped-YRTC-Juvenile-following-pursuit-570182961.html", "title": "Troopers arrest escaped YRTC Juvenile following pursuit", "description": "Troopers with the Nebraska State Patrol have arrested a juvenile, who had escaped from the Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center in Kearney, following a pursuit near Grand Island.", "image": "https://media.graytvinc.com/images/Cop+Lights+33.jpg"}, "burst": "ksnb"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.1011now.com/content/news/Troopers-arrest-escaped-YRTC-Juvenile-following-pursuit-570182961.html"}
