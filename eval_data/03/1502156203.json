is warm, hospitable and resilient.\n\nA melting pot of Spanish, Taino Indian and African cultures, cuisine and breathtaking nature leaves travelers breathless, and yet, whether it\u2019s your first or tenth time visiting, the island always feels like home.\n\nThe seismic activity that recently occurred has left many wondering about its effect on tourism in Puerto Rico.\n\nAfter Governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez declared a state of emergency, as a precaution to ensure resources such as FEMA and the National Guard were deployed to support areas in the southern region, the public had many questions.\n\nMy team at Discover Puerto Rico, the island\u2019s Destination Marketing Organization, experienced many inquiries from travelers, all of them ultimately begging the question \u2013 \u201cIs Puerto Rico open for tourists?\u201d\n\nUnwavering, our answer remains and is, yes.\n\nAfter the seismic activity, the island saw no significant disruptions to tourism as most areas outside the southern region of the island were not structurally impacted.\n\nUnfortunately, in the south, there were two tourism sites, Punta Ventana in Guayanilla and the Ruins of the Lighthouse in Gu\u00e1nica that were damaged.\n\nOut of 160 hotels endorsed by the Puerto Rico Tourism Company (PRTC) throughout the island, only the Copamarina Beach Resort in Gu\u00e1nica and the Costa Bah\u00eda Hotel in Guayanilla are working on repairing damages, all others are hosting visitors.\n\nFollowing the natural disturbances, 99 percent of power has been restored to those who initially lost it, flights are operating normally to/from the San Juan, Ponce and Aguadilla airports and all major hotels are open and welcoming guests.\n\nHotel El Convento in Old San Juan.\n\nIn the days that followed the seismic activity, we welcomed 56,000 cruise passengers into our San Juan Port who had the chance to explore the vibrant, cobble stoned streets of Old San Juan.\n\nWe want to continue the boom that tourism had in the past year and keep the industry strong in order to continue growing the economy.\n\nThe tourism industry accounts for close to 80,000 jobs across 17 different sectors and 6.5% of the economy\u2019s GDP. We stand in solidarity with impacted communities recovering in the southern region and are confident that the tourism industry will support the recuperation of those areas. In 2019, tourism in Puerto Rico broke boundaries with real results that impacted the local economy.\n\nThe island welcomed over 4 million visitors and had a 55 percent increase in tourism demand. Total lodging inventory increased 3.4 percent and air access is currently at a 10-year high with a projection of over 5 million inbound seats. There are even new and exciting offerings including the farm-to-table movement and a bustling, soon to be open, entertainment complex.\n\nWe are encouraging people to show their support by traveling to the Island for their vacations, work trips, meetings, conferences and events. With offerings for every type of traveler, we urge visitors to enjoy the Island\u2019s eclectic culture, gastronomy and unbeatable attractions. Our beaches, restaurants, hotels and travel service providers across the Island are open and ready to welcome visitors.\n\nThe Ponce Cruise Port, the Puerto Rico Convention Center, and major attractions such as El Morro, El Yunque, and San Cristobal Fort, continue to be open for business.\n\nTravelers with questions about their personal itineraries should reach out to their specific travel providers, hotels and other businesses to confirm details of their operations.\n\nThe island is filled with wonderful and resilient people who have hospitality in their DNA. If we are to continue the tourism boom we saw in 2019, and drive the economy of local communities, we need to ensure potential visitors know that Puerto Rico is open for tourism, and with good reason.\n\nThere is much to explore in every part of Puerto Rico.\n\nWith this, we invite you to come eat with us, dance with us and experience the unique beauty and warmth of our people.\n\nBrad Dean is the CEO of Discover Puerto Rico.\n\nNote: the opinions expressed in Caribbean Journal Op-Eds are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Caribbean Journal.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["caribbean", "aguadilla", "ponce", "puerto rico", "beach", "earthquake", "seismic", "old san juan", "san juan", "cruise", "earthquakes", "resort", "cruise port", "hotels", "tourism", "hotel"], "authors": ["Brad Dean"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan 22 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "My team at Discover Puerto Rico experienced many inquiries from travelers, all of them ultimately begging the question \u201cIs Puerto Rico open for tourists?\"", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://3j0grh44ocny4a6kcn288izx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-cj-logo-32x32.jpg", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "ClggjKRz-S9G8GhuF07N2a-OQJ-d-KeAevKZ4S-xHPU", "msvalidate.01": "229F7F1C76E5AFBCEF89E5F635D772DA", "B-verify": "d4c94eadf802b94e889616d3b6d8988a2dd8cc46", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 631001637, "app_id": 728628153874131}, "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.caribjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/puerto-rico-tourism-open-cover.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 675, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Op-Ed: Yes, Puerto Rico Is Open for Tourism - Caribbean Journal", "description": "My team at Discover Puerto Rico experienced many inquiries from travelers, all of them ultimately begging the question \u201cIs Puerto Rico open for tourists?\"", "url": "https://www.caribjournal.com/2020/01/22/puerto-rico-open-tourism-yes-op-ed/", "site_name": "Caribbean Journal", "article": {"author": {"image": "https://www.caribjournal.com/wp-content/themes/caribbean_2016_theme/images/caribbean_journal_logo.svg"}}}, "description": "My team at Discover Puerto Rico experienced many inquiries from travelers, all of them ultimately begging the question \u201cIs Puerto Rico open for tourists?\"", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CaribJournal", "published_time": "2020-01-22T16:39:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-22T22:43:17+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@caribjournal", "site": "@caribjournal", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Brad Dean", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.caribjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-cj-logo-270x270.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.caribjournal.com/2020/01/22/puerto-rico-open-tourism-yes-op-ed/"}
