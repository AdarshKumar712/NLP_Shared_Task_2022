Shielding themselves from others has protected their friends, family, and general public.\n\n\u201cHey, folks. Two weeks after our first symptoms and we feel better,\u201d Hanks tweeted.\n\n\u201cSheltering in place works like this: You don\u2019t give it to anyone \u2013 You don\u2019t get it from anyone. Common sense, no? Going to take awhile, but if we take care of each other, help where we can, and give up some comforts\u2026 this, too, shall pass. We can figure it out. Hanx.\u201d\n\nThe couple came forward on March 11 to say they were experiencing the symptoms of COVID-19. After they tested positive, they were quarantined at a Queensland hospital and then sent back to spend the remainder of their quarantine at their Australia home.\n\nThe pair are in Australia because Hanks is working on an Elvis Presley film.\n\nHanks and Wilson were among the first celebrities to acknowledge publicly that they had the disease. Since then, several other actors, athletes, and high-profile politicians have come forward to confirm they tested positive. Idris Elba, Kevin Durant, Andy Cohen, Olga Kurylenko, and Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) are just some of the inflicted.\n\nGlobally, there are now more than 335,000 confirmed coronavirus cases.
