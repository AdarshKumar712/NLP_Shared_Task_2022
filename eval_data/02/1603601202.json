While that deal fell apart, Goudreau has taken responsibility for going ahead with a failed attack launched May 3 on a beach outside the capital, Caracas.\n\nRendon said he gave Goudreau $50,000 to cover some initial expenses, but both say the contract was never fulfilled and he received no more funds.\n\nThe would-be invasion quickly became a publicity coup for Maduro, whose security forces intercepted most of the attackers.\n\nGuaid\u00f3's team said in a statement that he \u201caccepted the resignation of the officials and thanked them for their dedication and commitment to Venezuela.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["wire", "general news", "war and unrest"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ariana Cubillos", "Matias Delacroix"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) \u2014 Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 said Monday that two U.S.-based political advisers have resigned in the fallout from a failed incursion into the Caribbean nation led", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://muscatinejournal.com/content/tncms/site/icon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": "wire, general news, war and unrest", "news_keywords": "wire, general news, war and unrest", "description": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) \u2014 Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 said Monday that two U.S.-based political advisers have resigned in the fallout from a failed incursion into the Caribbean nation led", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=441518644", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.muscatinejournal.news", "googlebot": "noarchive", "google-site-verification": "8hkNAxi0tHf3Ow3caSmOoCMbt0vyezsi_stFCHH0UBs", "msvalidate.01": "106560791A6200A80BCECBE5E23A2EA2", "y_key": "PRah6gnV34E7FNluCkd0BOm4bVhTShpfdHje8j8ERnO4zik1QdfubwS2da8_bXeYow--", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://muscatinejournal.com/news/world/guaid-advisers-quit-following-bungled-venezuela-raid/article_d6c57f32-1570-525a-8985-11ad3ba54b09.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/muscatinejournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/cf/0cf636ce-1323-50c5-b8e9-29095b929cb5/5eb9932d82a5d.image.jpg?crop=1741%2C979%2C0%2C105&resize=1120%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "width": 1120, "height": 630}, "title": "Guaid\u00f3 advisers quit following bungled Venezuela raid", "description": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) \u2014 Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 said Monday that two U.S.-based political advisers have resigned in the fallout from a failed incursion into the Caribbean nation led", "site_name": "Muscatine Journal", "section": "World"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@journalonline", "image": {"alt": "Guaid\u00f3 advisers quit following bungled Venezuela raid"}}, "fb": {"pages": 55294244167}, "parsely-title": "Guaid\u00f3 advisers quit following bungled Venezuela raid", "parsely-link": "https://muscatinejournal.com/news/world/guaid-advisers-quit-following-bungled-venezuela-raid/article_d6c57f32-1570-525a-8985-11ad3ba54b09.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-05-11T12:43:50-0500", "parsely-post-id": "d6c57f32-1570-525a-8985-11ad3ba54b09", "parsely-image-url": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/muscatinejournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/cf/0cf636ce-1323-50c5-b8e9-29095b929cb5/5eb9932d82a5d.image.jpg?crop=1741%2C979%2C0%2C105&resize=1120%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "parsely-section": "World", "parsely-tags": "wire, general news, war and unrest, ap"}, "canonical_link": "https://apnews.com/28ccc2d2131e0c0ee0e8c7f5ab4cf922"}
