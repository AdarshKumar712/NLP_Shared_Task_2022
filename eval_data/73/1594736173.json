More than 90 percent of the FCA U.S. dealer network now uses web-based tools to sell cars and trucks.\n\n\u201cWe accelerated the introduction of ORE to help our dealers who were hampered by state mandates to shut down their new vehicle sales operations and showrooms amid the COVID-19 outbreak,\u201d says Jeff Kommor, U.S. head of sales for FCA. \u201cThe response has been phenomenal. Dealers are reaching new consumers while developing a different set of customer-relations skills since many of the transactions are now being completed in a customer\u2019s driveway rather than showroom.\u201d\n\nKommer estimates that about 20 percent of new sales leads now come from online retailing, compared to about 1 percent a year earlier.\n\n\u201cORE and other third-party applications have proven to be robust, reliable, and trustworthy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has been a journey, but we have finally reached that point where customers and dealers alike have embraced buying and selling vehicles through cyberspace.\u201d\n\nFCA developed the platform as a one stop shop to help dealers handle the entire process from trade-in to final signatures. It is accessible through the brand websites, participating dealer sites, and social media applications.\n\nCustomers first select a make and model from a brand website and are then transitioned to a corresponding dealership offering the selection. Features allow customers to determine trade-in value for their older vehicles, financing, and incentive availability. Customers are then provided a total cost, which is broken into monthly payment estimates. The credit application, title, loan, and all other paperwork are completed online using e-signatures. The new vehicle is delivered, and the trade-in is taken away.\n\nKommer says he expects the number of participating dealers to grow over the next few months.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Daily News"], "authors": ["Grace Turner", "Tim Keenan", "R.J.
