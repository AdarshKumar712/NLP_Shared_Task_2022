Wuhan resident Tong Zhengkun was one of millions of people enjoying a renewed sense of freedom after two months indoors on Wednesday when the restrictions were lifted.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been outside for more than 70 days,\u201d an emotional Tong said as he watched a celebratory light display from a bridge across the broad Yangtze River flowing through the city. \u201cBeing indoors for so long drove me crazy.\u201d\n\nStreets in the city of 11 million people were clogged with traffic and long queues formed at the airport, railway and bus stations as thousands streamed out of the city to return to homes and jobs elsewhere.\n\nYellow barriers that had blocked off some streets were gone, although the gates to residential compounds remained guarded. Tong said his apartment complex was shut down after residents were found to have contracted the virus. Neighbourhood workers delivered groceries to his door.\n\nSuch measures will not be entirely abandoned following the end of the city\u2019s closure, which began on January 23 as the virus was raging through the city and overwhelming hospitals. Schools are still closed, temperatures are checked when people enter buildings and masks are strongly encouraged. City leaders say they want to simultaneously bring back social and commercial life while avoiding a second wave of infections. The ability to travel again is a huge relief, however, and around 65,000 were expected to depart on Wednesday by plane and train.\n\nWuhan residents are now permitted to leave without special authorisation as long as a mandatory smartphone application powered by a mix of data-tracking and government surveillance shows they are healthy and have not been in recent contact with anyone confirmed to have the virus.\n\nIt did not take long for traffic to begin moving swiftly through the reopened bridges, tunnels and highway toll booths.\n\nNearly 1,000 vehicles went through a busy highway toll booth at Wuhan\u2019s border between midnight, when barricades were lifted, and 7am, according to Yan Xiangsheng, a district police chief.\n\nAccording to airport official Lou Guowei, the first departing flight, MU2527, left Wuhan Tianhe International Airport for Sanya, a coastal city in Hainan province known for its beaches. \u201cThe crew will wear goggles, masks, and gloves throughout the flight,\u201d chief flight attendant Guo Binxue, was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua News Agency. \u201cIt will be very smooth because we have made much preparation for this flight.\u201d\n\nRestrictions in the city where most of China\u2019s more than 82,000 virus cases and over 3,300 deaths from Covid-19 were reported have been gradually eased as the number of new cases steadily declined. The government reported no new cases in the city on Wednesday.\n\nWhile there are questions about the veracity of China\u2019s count, the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei have been successful enough that other countries adopted similar measures.\n\nPeople leaving the city still face numerous hurdles at their final destinations, such as 14-day quarantines and nucleic acid tests.\n\nWuhan is a major centre for heavy industry, particularly cars, and while many major plants have restarted production, the small and midsize businesses that employ the most people are still suffering from both a lack of workers and demand.\n\nMeasures are being instituted to get them back on their feet, including 20 billion yuan in preferential loans, according to the city government.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["wuhan", "residents", "celebrate", "dark", "days", "lockdown"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "BEIJING: The citizens of the Chinese city where the Covid-19 crisis began have been celebrating the end of the dark days with lockdown over.
