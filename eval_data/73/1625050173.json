If you're a conservative, they do not want to hear from you, they do not want you to vote. They view you as a deplorable and they do not want you to exist on their platform.\"\n\nThe move by Twitter last week prompted an angry response by Trump, who within days signed an executive order calling for heightened government oversight of social platforms.\n\nTrump accuses the platforms of \"censorship\" and limiting \"free speech,\" but his critics say the president has distorted the interpretation of those terms and is himself seeking to regulate online content.\n\nIn contrast to Twitter and Snapchat, Facebook has defended his decision not to interfere with posts by Trump.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated his position in a call with employees this week, according to reports, despite criticism of the Facebook policy by civil rights activists.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has put an abrupt stop to traditional US political means of courting young voters -- forcing presidential candidates to turn to Snapchat instead.\n\nThe photo-sending app that boasts 229 million users -- better known for filters that turn your face into a puppy or a vampire -- is a new battlefield for opponents Trump and Biden, both of whom are in their 70s.\n\nLast month, Ken Farnaso, the Trump campaign deputy press secretary, told AFP that Snapchat was an important element of the re-election effort and that the Republican was ahead of Biden on the platform.\n\n\"It's clear that we're wiping the floor with Biden's campaign,\" Farnaso said of the Snapchat effort.\n\nCopyright AFP.
