Africa will not become testing ground for any vaccines against COVID-19.\n\nTedros spoke against the backlash that followed some suggestion by French doctors that a vaccine be tested in Africa.\n\n\u201cAfrica cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine\u201d, Tedros, an Ethiopian said on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe will follow all the rules to test any vaccine or therapeutics all over the world using exactly the same rule, whether it\u2019s in Europe, Africa or wherever,\u201d\n\nHe told a virtual briefing in Geneva that he was \u201cappalled\u201d by comments made last week by some scientists, who said the testing ground for the new vaccines will be Africa.\n\nTedros said \u201cthe hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop.\u201d\n\nTwo French doctors have been accused of racism after a TV debate in which one suggested trials in Africa to see if a tuberculosis vaccine would prove effective against coronavirus.\n\nThe WHO chief condemned those \u201cracist remarks\u201d in \u201cthe strongest terms\u201d.\n\nHe described them as \u201ca disgrace\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis(vaccine testing) will not happen in Africa, and will not happen elsewhere, in any country.\u201d\n\n\u201cProper protocols will be followed and human beings will be treated as human beings\u2026 the same way equally,\u201d he said.\n\nTedros revealed that the WHO would hopefully announce later this week an initiative to accelerate research, development and production of vaccines against COVID-19, as well as designed mechanisms for \u201cequitable distribution\u201d of the vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe will have a problem while looking for vaccines, unless we break the barriers to equitable distribution of the products,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cwe need to address the challenges to access ahead of time.\u201d\n\nAccording to the WHO chief, more than 70 countries have joined WHO\u2019s Solidarity Trial to accelerate the search for an effective treatment.\n\nAnd about 20 institutions and companies are racing to develop a vaccine.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Apr  7 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "",
