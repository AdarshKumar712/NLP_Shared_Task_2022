All three witnesses observed different pieces of what they described as erratic driving by the police officer. The majority of the erratic driving was observed by one civilian witness, who observed it in their rear view mirror. Another civilian witness initially believed that weather conditions might have played a role in the erratic driving observed. There were vague descriptions as to the duration of the erratic driving.\n\nThe IIU said all three witnesses are very reluctant to attend Court and testify. The witness officer, who had direct contact with the police officer observed no signs or incidents of erratic driving on the part of police officer during his contact with him.\n\nIIU Civilian Director Zane Tessler was not satisfied there was sufficient evidence to believe an offence had occurred.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cjrb News"], "publish_date": "Sat Mar 28 12:10:57 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/templates/gantry/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "CJRB News", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "url": "https://discoverwestman.com/local/no-charges-in-neepawa-incident", "title": "No Charges In Neepawa Incident - DiscoverWestman.com"}, "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "fb": {"app_id": 1847631348898995, "admins": 563760633}, "og": {"title": "No Charges In Neepawa Incident - DiscoverWestman.com", "type": "article", "url": "https://discoverwestman.com/local/no-charges-in-neepawa-incident", "site_name": "DiscoverWestman.com"}}, "canonical_link": "https://discoverwestman.com/local/no-charges-in-neepawa-incident"}
