This new study goes much further in support of antigenic imprinting,\u201d said study lead author Alain Gagnon from the University of Montreal.\n\n\u201cInstead of just showing how specific age patterns are associated with one subtype or the other during a single influenza season, we took advantage of a unique \u2018natural experiment\u2019 to show how the change in subtype dominance during one season appears to lead, practically in real time, to a change in susceptibility by age,\u201d Gagnon explained.\n\nResearchers hope to further explore transmission dynamics by analysing how viruses spread within households, where exposure is high and prolonged.\n\n\u2013IANS\n\nbu/rs", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["first", "virus", "immunity", "exposure"], "authors": ["Canindia New Wire Service", "Author"], "publish_date": "Fri Jan 24 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-CINEWS-ICON1-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"title": "How first exposure to flu virus sets on immunity for life", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.canindia.com/how-first-exposure-to-flu-virus-sets-on-immunity-for-life/", "site_name": "Canindia News", "description": "Toronto, Jan 31 (IANS) The first type of influenza virus we are exposed to in early childhood dictates our ability to fight the flu for the rest of our lives, a", "image": "http://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AVTAR_CI2019-1.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "How first exposure to flu virus sets on immunity for life", "description": "Toronto, Jan 31 (IANS) The first type of influenza virus we are exposed to in early childhood dictates our ability to fight the flu for the rest of our lives, a", "image": "http://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AVTAR_CI2019-1.png"}, "author": "CanIndia New Wire Service", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.5", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-CINEWS-ICON1-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.canindia.com/how-first-exposure-to-flu-virus-sets-on-immunity-for-life/"}
