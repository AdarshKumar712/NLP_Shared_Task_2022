The rapid screening, which started at Busselton on Friday May 1, 2020, will be rolled out at Geraldton and Albany in coming weeks, will mirror the five-layer rapid COVID-19 process successfully introduced at Perth Airport last month. Approximately 900 Rio Tinto FIFO employees and contractors are expected to commute from Busselton, Geraldton and Albany to operations in the Pilbara every fortnight. Those traveling have been asked to arrive at least 30 minutes earlier than they normally would arrive to allow for the screening process. Trained medical staff manage the COVID-19 screening process which is overseen by Rio Tinto's occupational physician, who is also overseeing a comprehensive research program into COVID-19 screening outcomes. The rapid screening process includes an online and face-to-face health questionnaire, a temperature check and the rapid finger pinprick blood screen to detect viral-related antibodies that is performed by a qualified nurse. The blood sample is not a diagnostic test for COVID-19. If the blood screen is clear, a coloured wristband is given to confirm the person has been screened and can board their flight. Anyone identified as requiring further testing will not be allowed to depart and will be directed to undertake a diagnostic test for COVID-19 at an approved clinic. About 100 jobs have been created to help facilitate Rio Tinto's screening process at Perth, Busselton, Albany and Geraldton airports. This includes the hiring of out-of-work nurses impacted by restrictions on elective surgery at WA hospitals. More than 8000 Rio Tinto FIFO workers and contractors have now been through the rapid COVID-19 screening process since its introduction at Perth Airport last month. Rio Tinto Iron Ore chief executive officer Chris Salisbury said their number one priority was to protect the health of their employees and communities where they operated and that's why they have expanded their screening efforts to include important regional hubs like Busselton. \"The broader roll-out of our layered screening process to other regional airports such as Geraldton and Albany will allow us to continue operating safely and, importantly, making a strong contribution to Western Australian communities,\" he said. \"Since the introduction at Perth Airport last month, rapid screening has proven to be an effective tool enabling the quick identification of people who may be at increased risk of having a viral illness prior to getting on a plane and arriving at a site in the Pilbara.\" Vasse MLA Libby Mettam said it was clearly in the state and region's interest that the mining industry continued to operate during this period and a significant factor in ensuring this is to provide all possible protections to their critical workforce. \"Rapid screening has a key role to play in ensuring the travelling workforce is maintained,\" she said. \"Last month I wrote to the Minister for Health advocating in support of this private screening and it is fantastic to see it being expanded in the region, and across other regions as well.\"\n\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/S2kBkURjWY7PhPtZJcQ5Zm/3d7381e4-5524-451d-af92-004b32043c4f.jpg/r3_84_902_592_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n\nRio Tinto enhances COVID-19 screening at Busselton Margaret River Airport", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri May  1 11:36:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Rio Tinto has broadened its COVID-19 screening measures in WA by introducing rapid screening for its fly-in-fly-out workforce at Busselton, Geraldton and Alba...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://nnstatic-a.akamaihd.net/s/1591163072/sites/busselton-dunsborough-mail/ico/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "title": "Rio Tinto enhances COVID-19 screening at Busselton Margaret River Airport", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Rio Tinto has broadened its COVID-19 screening measures in WA by introducing rapid screening for its fly-in-fly-out workforce at Busselton, Geraldton and Alba...", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/busseltonmail", "published_time": "2020-05-01T11:36:00+08:00"}, "og": {"title": "Rio Tinto enhances COVID-19 screening at Busselton Margaret River Airport", "url": "https://www.busseltonmail.com.au/story/6742492/rio-tinto-enhances-covid-19-screening-at-busselton-margaret-river-airport/", "site_name": "Busselton-Dunsborough Mail", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/S2kBkURjWY7PhPtZJcQ5Zm/3d7381e4-5524-451d-af92-004b32043c4f.jpg/r3_84_902_592_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 678, "width": 1200}, "description": "Rio Tinto has broadened its COVID-19 screening measures in WA by introducing rapid screening for its fly-in-fly-out workforce at Busselton, Geraldton and Alba..."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@BusseltonMail", "title": "Rio Tinto enhances COVID-19 screening at Busselton Margaret River Airport", "description": "Rio Tinto has broadened its COVID-19 screening measures in WA by introducing rapid screening for its fly-in-fly-out workforce at Busselton, Geraldton and Alba...", "image": "https://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/S2kBkURjWY7PhPtZJcQ5Zm/3d7381e4-5524-451d-af92-004b32043c4f.jpg/r3_84_902_592_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}, "news_keywords": "news, local-news,", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msvalidate.01": "F29B95B17E7034DD0832B3DBEF37C0F2"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.busseltonmail.com.au/story/6742492/rio-tinto-enhances-covid-19-screening-at-busselton-margaret-river-airport/"}
