The court has twice upheld the heart of the law, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts memorably siding with the court's liberals in 2012, amid President Barack Obama's reelection campaign. The majority that upheld the law twice remains on the court, Roberts and the four liberal justices.\n\nThe Trump administration supports the total repeal of the law, including its provisions that prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against people with existing health ailments. The entire health care law is in effect pending the ongoing court case.\n\nThe Democratic states had asked for a fast-track review with a decision by late June, before the 2020 elections in November. Instead, the justices probably will hear arguments in the fall, with a decision likely in the spring of 2021.\n\nThe high court action takes the case out of the hands of a federal district judge in Texas who had previously struck down the entire law.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "publish_date": "Mon Mar  2 13:08:22 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide a lawsuit that threatens the Obama-era health care law, but the decision is not likely until after the 2020 election.
