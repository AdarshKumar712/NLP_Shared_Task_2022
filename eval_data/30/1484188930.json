The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are coming, some long-awaited titles like The Last of Us Part II and Final Fantasy VII Remake will finally arrive, and cloud gaming and other new ways to play will continue to make inroads. 2020 is going to be a year of transition and upheaval for our hobby, which means it\u2019s a great time for all good little gamers to turn over a new leaf. To make some New Year\u2019s resolutions that will improve your own situation and the gaming scene as a whole.\n\nOf course, sometimes it\u2019s tough to come up with good resolutions, so I\u2019m here to help! Here are a few 2020 gaming resolution suggestions to get your minds percolating\u2026\n\nThe Financial Year in Tech 2019: Highs, Lows, and Future Trends\n\nSlim Down Your Backlog in January and February\n\nIt\u2019s time to put your pile of shame on a diet. 2020 will eventually see some big releases, with March and April being particularly crazy, but the first two months of the year? Those are unusually barren, so it\u2019s time to finally finish up some of those games that have been lingering for weeks, months, or even years. Personally, I\u2019m finally going to see the end of Red Dead Redemption 2. It, uh, all turns out great, right?\n\nTruly Master at Least One Game\n\nWhile that aforementioned March-April period will be out of control (get ready for Final Fantasy VII Remake, Cyberpunk 2077, Resident Evil 3, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and more within the span of weeks) but, overall, 2020 is a transition year. Things will probably be a bit slower than usual, particularly if you don\u2019t pick up a PS4 or Xbox Series X (we\u2019ll talk about that later). That means, instead of increasing your pile of shame, 2020 is a great year to really drill down and master something. Really become good at a fighting or action game or 100 percent that new RPG. It\u2019s more satisfying to master one game than half-finish a half dozen, and your bank account will thank you.\n\nStop Fighting Steam and Epic\u2019s Battles for Them\n\nThankfully, it already seems to be dying down a bit, but the Steam vs. Epic Games Store Wars were the most pointless thing we devoted our time to in 2019. These massively-profitable companies don\u2019t need you fighting their battles for them. Downloading an extra launcher is not a huge imposition, and we\u2019re finally starting to see some real, consumer-benefitting competition, with both Steam and Epic offering some great promotions this holiday season.\n\nArise: A Simple Story Review \u2013 A Good Life, A So-So Video Game\n\nI\u2019d say you should all give up your console and NVIDIA vs. AMD wars as well, but I\u2019m trying to keep these resolutions at least somewhat realistic.\n\nStay Vigilant About Monetization\n\n2019 was the year the loot box died (or least started writing up its Last Will and Testament) and it was regular players speaking up that forced the change. The big publishers certainly wouldn\u2019t have given them up on their own. That said, do keep an eye out for new monetization schemes, because you know certain publishers are diligently working on their next big money-grubbing innovation.\n\nDon\u2019t Buy a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X at Launch\n\nI won\u2019t be sticking to this resolution myself, but if you don\u2019t strictly need a next-gen console for your job like I do, wait a while to buy PS5 or Xbox Series X. Consoles are overpriced at launch and it takes a while before you know if a machine is going to be successful. Also, in most cases, the first great, truly next-gen games don\u2019t come out until about a year into a console\u2019s lifespan. Both the PS5 and XSX are probably going to be around for a while, so sit back, consider your options, and make an informed decision.\n\nDo Buy a Switch if You Haven\u2019t Already\n\nBut maybe you have some cash earmarked for a new console just burning a hole in your pocket? Well, if you haven\u2019t already, go ahead and grab yourself a Switch. Yes, it\u2019s not the most powerful machine on the market, but 2019 was the year Nintendo\u2019s little system definitively proved it was more than just a gimmick. The Switch boasts a fantastic library featuring top-notch Nintendo exclusives, the best indies of the past five years, and a handful of surprisingly-solid triple-A ports. I\u2019m a pretty platform-agnostic kind of guy, but this past year most of my gaming free time was spent on the Switch. You might be surprised to find the same thing happening to you.\n\nDon\u2019t Be Jerks to People Who Make the Games You Love\n\nWe\u2019re all passionate about his hobby, but that passion can turn into anger when a game or series does something you don\u2019t like. I totally get that, but that said, do keep in mind that games are made by real people, most of whom are just trying their best to make something that will entertain players, so don\u2019t lash out at them. Most of the decisions you\u2019re upset about were probably made by committee in fancy boardrooms, so reserve your anger for publishers, not the rank and file. Also, do try to support devs when stories of crunch or workplace toxicity come out. Happy devs make better games, so better workplace conditions benefit everyone.\n\nPlay More Games With Friends\n\nI\u2019ve always believed gaming is at its best when you\u2019re playing with someone close to you on the same couch, or, failing that, a real friend over the Internet. Unfortunately, it\u2019s all too easy to fall into the habit of just playing randoms online \u2013 to start thinking of the people you\u2019re playing strictly as adversaries instead of friends. A lot of modern games, particularly battle royale stuff, really encourages that. I can guarantee you\u2019ll feel a little better about the hobby, and have to absorb a lot less abuse from trolls, if you make the time to game with friends and family more often.\n\nTry Something New\u2026\n\nAs I\u2019ve said, 2020 is a transition year, so why not branch out with something new? Give a genre you\u2019ve never tried a spin, or give one you gave up on long ago another shot. Give that quirky indie a chance. A lot of 2019\u2019s best games were off the regular beaten path, and the same will probably hold true for 2020.\n\n\u2026But Don\u2019t Be Ashamed to Like What You Like\n\nThat said, while trying something new is worthwhile, don\u2019t be afraid to wear your quirky gaming tastes on your sleeve. You don\u2019t have to pretend to be into the next Call of Duty or Madden if you\u2019d rather be playing weird Japanese visual novels. Or dense PC strategy games. Or candy-colored rhythm games. Or Pokemon Go. Or whatever! If you genuinely love CoD, that\u2019s fine too. The gaming scene is more varied than ever, so you do you.\n\nSo, there you go, a few suggested New Year\u2019s resolutions for 2020. Of course, nobody\u2019s forcing you to take my advice!
