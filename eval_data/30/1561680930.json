The memo reads, \u201cour Hospital is in need of medical, surgical and procedural masks. While model numbers of the N95 masks in the 1860, 1860s, 1870+, 8110s and 8210 are preferred, we are accepting all masks. We\u2019re also in need of impervious gowns and face shields and new or gently used baby monitors. Please share this link (www.stjoesfoundation.ca/supplydrive/ ) with more information about our Supply Drive or email: donations@stjoes.ca .\n\nThe Hospital also noted that it is preparing for an influx of COVID19 patients. \u201cTo accommodate the expected demand from COVID-19, we will be repurposing the currently empty, former Fracture Clinic space for Emergency Department use. This will be a temporary measure, as this space is slated to be redeveloped for Psychiatric Emergency Services. We will reactivate the plan to redevelop Psychiatric Emergency Services in that space as soon as possible.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Mar 28 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, viewport-fit=cover", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2"}, "canonical_link": "http://bayobserver.ca/2020/03/28/st-joes-puts-out-a-call-for-masks/"}
