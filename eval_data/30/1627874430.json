While Prague maintains official diplomatic relations with China, dealings with the communist country have become strained, while ties with Taiwan have intensified.\n\nIn an interview with the Czech magazine Reflex, Vystr\u010dil said repeated attempts by Beijing to prevent trips by Kubera and by himself had only strengthened his determination to go ahead. He was likely to visit in September, since the Senate would select a new president in October, CNA reported.\n\nVystr\u010dil referred to the example of Vaclav Havel, the long-time dissident under the communist regime who later became president and visited Taiwan in 2004 after leaving office.\n\nIf the senate leader goes ahead with his trip, he will be the highest-ranking politician from the Czech Republic to have visited Taiwan. Only the president ranks higher in the Central European country\u2019s political structure.\n\nChina has threatened to retaliate against Czech business interests in the event of a Taiwan visit.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Jaroslav Kubera", "Milo\u0161 Vystr\u010dil", "Matthew Strong", "Czech Republic", "Czech Senate", "Chinese bullying"], "authors": ["Taiwan News"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Trip likely to occur in September despite China's threats to harm Czech business interests.The new president of the Czech Senate, Milo\u0161 Vystr\u010dil, will announce next week that he is planning to visit Taiwan in the autumn despite threats by China, reports said Saturday (June 6). | 2020/06/06", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/img/favicon-TN3.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Taiwan News", "description": "Trip likely to occur in September despite China's threats to harm Czech business interests.The new president of the Czech Senate, Milo\u0161 Vystr\u010dil, will announce next week that he is planning to visit Taiwan in the autumn despite threats by China, reports said Saturday (June 6). | 2020/06/06", "msvalidate.01": "1B767768A4DBD00EE727D7234A6D366E", "google-site-verification": "z_olpn978vuQe5nR1yuzhIPFXgCbfnPNxUjkXN46Q_0", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Taiwan News", "title": "Czech Senate president plans Taiwan visit | Taiwan News", "url": "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3945123", "description": "Trip likely to occur in September despite China's threats to harm Czech business interests.The new president of the Czech Senate, Milo\u0161 Vystr\u010dil, will announce next week that he is planning to visit Taiwan in the autumn despite threats by China, reports said Saturday (June 6).", "image": {"identifier": "https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/2020/06/06/1591407286-5edaf2b693f9c.PNG", "width": 640, "height": 442}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1082075965223782}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3945123"}
