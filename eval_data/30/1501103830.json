In order to do that, the department said it will continue to work on partnerships with local and federal agencies.\u201cFrom August to December of 2019, we lost three children out of our schools. It\u2019s time to end that. We have to work together as a community to bring about the change that is needed,\u201d police Chief Catrina Thompson said. In 2019, the City of Winston-Salem had a total of 31 homicides. \u201cOur message is simple. To those who are committing violent crimes in our community, we want to say to you that it will not be tolerated, and we will do everything that we can to stop you,\u201d Council member James Taylor said. Thompson said in order to see change, the partnerships between local and federal agencies need to continue in 2020.\u201cYou have to have resources -- federal, state, local and community -- in order to be able get after the root causes of violence and those who are committing violent crimes,\u201d said Matt Martin, U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina. \u201cWe\u2019re invested in the success of programs like Nibin, where we are using technology to try to identify the hot shooters, to try to identify the people who are terrorizing our neighborhoods. We\u2019re using things like notifications like the chief mentioned through our Project Safe Neighborhoods program to try to give people the dignity of a choice. You want to commit violence? You\u2019ve committed violence in the past? Well, that stops now because you\u2019re on our radar screen and you have a choice.\u201dThrough various partnerships and programs, the police department hopes to crack down on gang and gun violence in the community. \u201cOur hope is that by doing this we can get out in front of these crimes and stop them before they happen. That is the goal and mission of ATF and we\u2019re proud to be a part of this effort here in Winston-Salem,\u201d an ATF agent said. Thompson said law enforcement cannot do it on its own; they need help from the community. \u201cConnect with some of our nonprofit organizations like Smart Start and ask how you can be involved with reading to our young children so that we can address the literacy issue here in our community. Reach out to the school system and Dr. Hairston and find out how you can mentor a child, how you can adopt a school or classroom to help with our children,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cGangs are providing things to our children that they figure they need and are not getting in life. As parents, as community leaders, as law enforcement, we\u2019re the biggest gang in this town and we need to take charge of instilling hope in our children. A child without hope is a child living in danger.\u201dThompson said in 2018, the department sized more than 680 firearms. In 2019, she said, they seized 900. So far this year, they have seized 19 guns, which she said is on track to seizing hundreds of more guns by the end of 2020.Thompson wants to remind those who own guns to lock them up correctly, so they do not end up in the wrong hands. \u201cWe have people who are in lawful possession of guns, leaving them inside of locked vehicles unsecured. Somebody comes in, breaks into the vehicle and now we have a gun on the street that\u2019s being used to offend against our citizens,\u201d Thompson said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["2020", "ATF", "Crime", "Firearms", "Forsyth County Sheriff's Office", "Gang Violence", "Gangs", "Gun Violence", "Guns", "WXII 12 News", "Winston-Salem Police Department"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Kirsten Gutierrez", "Https", "Www.Facebook.Com Wxiikirstengutierrez"], "publish_date": "Tue Jan 21 22:22:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Winston-Salem police hope 2020 is the year they can truly crack down on gun violence.
