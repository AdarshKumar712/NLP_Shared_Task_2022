He explains exactly how this virus kills you. This is very startling information.\n\nYou could easily drop the beef of the video in point form.\n\nIt can\u2019t be too many points, The Duck Surgeon seem to be a longwinded man or duck. 34 minutes to explain, then he can\u2019t understand the subject very well.\n\nYou think this is very important but aren\u2019t willing to spend the time to write down the most important bits.\n\nNot spending 34 minutes on that. Time is money.\n\nBasically he gives you a short anatomy lesson, this information helps you to visualize exactly how the effects from this virus attack the body, one cell at a time.\n\nHe goes into detail explaining that the lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled organs located on either side of the chest (thorax). The trachea (windpipe) conducts inhaled air into the lungs through its tubular branches, called bronchi. The bronchi then divide into smaller and smaller branches (bronchioles), finally becoming microscopic.\n\nAlso that the lungs are covered by a thin tissue layer called the pleura a thin layer of fluid which acts as a lubricant allowing the lungs to slip smoothly as they expand and contract with each breath. However the virus cause the cells to die off, the body compensates by replicating the cells, thus drowning the person from the pneumonia or fluid in the lungs.\n\nIt then cascades- over taxing the heart, or rather starving the heart, liver, kidneys and organs from the necessary oxygen, causing organ failure.\n\nBasically if you have underlying illness with your lungs, heart, liver or kidneys, you are probably DOA.\n\nDon\u2019t expose yourself, save yourself and a medical worker. Don\u2019t be a selfish bastard who gallops about doing his thing because I AM A FREE MAN..\n\nThis is not the time for that sentiment. I am my Brothers keeper.\n\nsnip from link below\n\nwww.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lung_cancer_picture/picture.htm\n\nh/t LG\n\n90 views", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["virus", "kills", "vuong", "corona", "explains", "surgeon"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Mar 28 22:02:15 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/logo81-1-150x130.jpg", "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.9.16", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/logo81-1.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/surgeon-duc-c-vuong-explains-how-the-corona-virus-kills-you/"}
