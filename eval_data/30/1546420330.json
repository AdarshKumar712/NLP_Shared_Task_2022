Ralph Northam took to a podium in Richmond on Thursday afternoon to declare a state of emergency in Virginia.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference Thursday afternoon, Northam also advised all Virginians to avoid large gatherings \u201cfor the time being.\u201d He said he was canceling all state conferences and large events for the next 30 days and announced new restrictions on travel for state workers.\n\n\u201cOur top priority is to make sure Virginians stay safe and healthy, and that our response to this situation leaves no one behind,\u201d said Governor Northam. \u201cFrom our health department, to our schools, to our hospitals, to our transit systems, Virginia\u2019s agencies and institutions have been thoroughly planning for every scenario. This emergency declaration will ensure we can continue to prepare for and appropriately respond to Virginians\u2019 needs during this time.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s emergency declaration is an administrative tool that allows for additional flexibility in dealing with the outbreak.\n\nHere are some major parts of Northam\u2019s announcement:\n\nVirginia has over 100,000 state employees stationed throughout the Commonwealth. Governor Northam has halted all official travel outside of Virginia by state employees, with increased flexibility for inter-state commuters and essential personnel. Specific guidance will be released to agency heads and state employees, and Virginia will revisit these guidelines after 30 days.\n\nIn accordance with advice from state public health experts, the Commonwealth of Virginia will cancel all specially-scheduled state conferences and large events for a minimum of 30 days.\n\nWhile containing the spread of the public health threat remains a top priority, Governor Northam is working with state and local partners to ensure Virginia are prepared for any continued economic disruption.\n\nThis comes as 17 people have \u201cpresumptively positive\u201d cases of the coronavirus in Virginia as of March 12, 2020.\n\nThese cases are \u201cpresumptively positive,\u201d meaning they are pending confirmatory testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Coronavirus", "Virginia"], "tags": ["Coronavirus and the Classroom", "Virginia Tech", "Census", "Top 10", "Healthy Heart", "New Virginia Economy", "Botetourt 250", "Tasty Tuesday", "Something Good", "Black History Month", "30 Days of Hope", "Virginia", "Valentine's Day", "1st and 10", "In A Day's Drive", "Coronavirus", "High School", "NFL", "Virginia For Veterans", "Feel Good VA", "Trust Index", "Picture of the Day", "Illuminights", "20/20 Focus"], "authors": ["Jeff Williamson"], "publish_date": "Thu Mar 12 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Gov.
