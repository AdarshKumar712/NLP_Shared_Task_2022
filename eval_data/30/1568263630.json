However, C-Fam discovered that \u201csexual and reproductive health and rights\u201d also are listed as a key priority in the plan.\n\n\u201c[The plan] calls on the humanitarian response to be guided by \u2018Minimum Initial Service Package\u2019 or MISP, for reproductive health in emergencies,\u201d according to the pro-life organization. \u201cThe UN manual which contains the MISP says that medical personnel should refer for abortions even against their consciences. Guterres\u2019 plan also allocates $140 million to the pro-abortion UN population fund.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization also is promoting non-essential, elective abortions as an \u201cessential service\u201d during the health crisis.\n\nHere\u2019s more from the report:\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s choices and rights to sexual and reproductive health care should be respected irrespective of COVID-19 status, including access to contraception and safe abortion to the full extent of the law,\u201d the WHO manual reads, after pointing out that there are no known complications related to pregnancy from the novel coronavirus. Last week, a WHO staffer said the WHO has been working to ensure abortion drugs are considered \u201cessential\u201dduring a webinar hosted by a pro-abortion journal. She praised abortion groups urging governments to designate abortion \u201cessential.\u201d She also promoted the WHO\u2019s official view that where access to abortion is difficult, women should self-administer abortions.\n\nAmerica gives huge amounts of money to the United Nations. However, President Donald Trump and his administration have been pushing back aggressively against the United Nations\u2019 pro-abortion agenda, insisting that countries support women and children, born and unborn.\n\nFollow LifeNews.com on Instagram for pro-life pictures and videos.\n\nIn 2017, Trump stopped giving tax dollars to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) because it pushes abortions on other countries and has worked with China for decades to implement its forced abortion population control policies. Trump renewed the order again in 2018 and 2019. The decision cut $32.5 million in funding from the UNFPA budget.\n\nStill, it appears that more needs to be done. Abortion groups receive funding from many different sources, both government and private; and cutting off taxpayer funding to abortions entirely is not easily done. And while the Trump administration has been working to restore a culture of life at the United Nations, there are many other countries and activists trying to do the exact opposite.\n\nThere is nothing essential about aborting an unborn baby. Abortions destroy unborn babies\u2019 lives and often put their mothers at risk. The world\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic has been to devote huge amounts of resources and sacrifice greatly to save human lives. If only society would make similar efforts to save babies in the womb.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Apr  3 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Life News", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Life News", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "UN Plan to Spend $2 Billion Fighting Coronavirus Will Include Killing Babies in Abortions - LifeNews.com", "description": "United Nations leaders are pushing through a $2 billion spending plan for the coronavirus that includes funding to abort unborn babies in elective abortions.
