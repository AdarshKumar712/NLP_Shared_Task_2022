Food drives are a common practice in the country during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nAfghanistan is battling a growing coronavirus outbreak that has exacerbated problems with food access in the impoverished country.\n\nAFP", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat May  9 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "//www.channelstv.com/wp-content/themes/channels2016/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "6JVFjvtKtlBAOBeZjx02KYOCAJqmYfH--9_EmfNIsw8", "alexaVerifyID": "s6Y-9oImS488Fgxe-Oc84mxGsd8", "msvalidate.01": "51A9C00FE7BE8C94DDAE034F74141D4A", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=674628071", "theme-color": "#00265E", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#00265E", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Six Dead In Afghanistan After Food Donation Turns Violent", "description": "Six Dead In Afghanistan After Food Donation Turns Violent", "image": "https://www.channelstv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/afghan.png", "url": "https://www.channelstv.com/2020/05/09/six-dead-in-afghanistan-after-food-donation-turns-violent/", "site_name": "Channels Television"}, "fb": {"app_id": 205604876116272}, "application-name": "Channels Television", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "small.jpg", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "medium.jpg", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "wide.jpg", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "large.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00265E", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.channelstv.com/2020/05/09/six-dead-in-afghanistan-after-food-donation-turns-violent/"}
