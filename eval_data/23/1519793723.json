About 20% of global trials are now conducted in China, up from about 10% just five years ago, according to GlobalData Plc.\n\nChina has imposed a virtual lockdown on Wuhan and severely restricted travel in its wider province of Hubei and some other cities.\n\nWhile it is too early in the outbreak first detected in December to fully assess its impact on clinical trials, if it goes on much longer the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s China strategy is likely to be disrupted.\n\nVirus-curbing efforts by the government have made it difficult for trial patients to reach hospitals running studies, according to interviews with two contract research organizations that conduct trials for drugmakers, local drug companies, and doctors.\n\nOthers fear to become infected if they return to a healthcare facility for a trial.\n\n\u201cHospitals aren\u2019t focused on clinical trials right now,\u201d said Ian Woo, president, and chief financial officer of Everest Medicines, which is developing drugs for the Chinese market. \u201cThey have plenty of other things to be focused on.\u201d\n\nThe outbreak has delayed the launch of new studies, and research organizations like dMed Biopharmaceutical Co said they have been unable to send staff to monitor trial sites.\n\nAffected ongoing studies include trials testing a Novartis medicine for a rare blood disorder, a cancer drug from BeiGene Ltd and a treatment for a type of spinal arthritis from Chinese drugmaker Tasly Pharmaceutical Group, according to doctors involved.\n\nBeijing-based BeiGene, which has more than 20 trials ongoing in Wuhan, said it was working to minimize potential delays and disruptions, but that it was \u201ctoo early to speculate on any specific impact on our clinical trial and commercial progress in China.\u201d\n\nOther drugmakers with trials in China, including Roche, Zai Lab Ltd and Hutchison China MediTech Ltd (Chi-Med), also said it was too soon to speculate on the outbreak\u2019s consequences. But the impact is being felt.\n\nShenghao Tu, who is working on the Tasly clinical trial in Wuhan, said the study in his hospital has been suspended.\n\n\u201cThis is a problem that (we) never encountered before,\u201d Tu said.\n\nThe issue is not limited to Wuhan.\n\nTwo doctors testing the BeiGene cancer drug tislelizumab in Beijing and Guangzhou city said efforts to contain the virus have hampered patient enrollment and capacity.\n\nBoth their hospitals now require that each room hold only one patient to prevent cross-infection, reducing the number they can accommodate.\n\nvanguard\n\nKindly Share This Story:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Lawal Sherifat", "View All Posts Lawal Sherifat"], "publish_date": "Thu Feb 13 06:50:31 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The fast-spreading coronavirus is starting to disrupt the testing of experimental medicines in China, posing a threat to plans by...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/favicon.png?fit=16%2C16&ssl=1", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1300", "fb": {"pages": 125111084176530, "app_id": 1281965775160257}, "OBKey": "KoeDKhtk63NPK0HQB1Wydg==", "description": "The fast-spreading coronavirus is starting to disrupt the testing of experimental medicines in China, posing a threat to plans by...", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Coronavirus outbreak begins to disrupt booming China drug trials", "description": "The fast-spreading coronavirus is starting to disrupt the testing of experimental medicines in China, posing a threat to plans by...", "url": "https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/02/coronavirus-outbreak-begins-to-disrupt-booming-china-drug-trials/", "site_name": "Vanguard News", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Coronavirus-e1579670198616.jpg?fit=1500%2C1001&ssl=1", "width": 1500, "height": 1001}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/vanguardngr", "published_time": "2020-02-13T06:50:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-12T18:20:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@vanguardngrnews", "site": "@vanguardngrnews"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "google-site-verification": "AjRfeo4BMZn8J99wiq7X1DKIfO_z-Dnma_6csxvuRRg", "alexaVerifyID": "GKUIyYVwwNAjNpxpU_bP3ZbGFeo", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/favicon.png?fit=16%2C16&ssl=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/02/coronavirus-outbreak-begins-to-disrupt-booming-china-drug-trials/"}
