MARK RALSTON (AFP)\n\nThe Spanish Health Ministry announced on Friday that two people in the country were under observation for symptoms of coronavirus. Both of them had recently arrived in Spain from the center of the current outbreak, the Chinese city of Wuhan. But later on Friday afternoon there was confirmation that tests on both the people had come back negative.\n\n\u201cOne of them has a very low probability [of having the disease], because the clinical characteristics are on the limit. And there is another which we are considering ruling out, because the incubation period has passed. There is no likelihood that they will test positive,\u201d said the director of the Health Ministry\u2019s Center for the Coordination of Health Emergencies, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, before the test results were known.\n\nWe are in flu season: any symptoms, even if you have traveled from the area, are likely to be flu\n\nFernando Sim\u00f3n, Center for the Coordination of Health Emergencies\n\nSim\u00f3n added that the Spanish health authorities have \u201clow, but active, concerns\u201d about the arrival of the virus in the country. The official went on to explain that a protocol is being prepared to deal with the pathogen.\n\n\u201cThe population should have a very low risk perception,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIf you are coming from Wuhan and you have symptoms, you should calmly head to your doctor. But we are in flu season: any symptoms, even if you have traveled from the area, are likely to be flu,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Spanish government is not currently planning on taking any special measures at the country\u2019s airports, given that there are no direct flights from Wuhan to Spain, and what\u2019s more, in Sim\u00f3n\u2019s words, this kind of measure \u201chas not proven to be effective.\u201d For now, only countries that have a direct air connection with the Chinese city are implementing such protocols.\n\nThe coronavirus has already caused 26 deaths and sickened 900 people in China, and more infections have been discovered in just over a dozen countries among people who recently traveled to the city, where a travel lock-down is in effect.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Pablo Linde"], "publish_date": "Fri Jan 24 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Both the people under observation have recently arrived from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak.
