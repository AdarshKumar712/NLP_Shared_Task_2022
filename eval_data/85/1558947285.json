This means that, every month, amateur football is losing 53 million euros,\" the economist emphasises.\n\nIn order to 'minimise' the losses, and in view of 'the uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic', Spadaro believes that the RFEF 'should now declare the 2019/2020 season over'.\n\n\"Such a measure would allow clubs to reduce costs almost definitively, and would also allow all football, not just amateur football, to benefit from emergency closures and, eventually, to apply for aid and compensation from the public authorities\", he says.\n\nThe monthly economic cost for the two autonomous federations with the largest number of licences, Catalonia and Madrid, would amount to 8,578,293 and 5,971,741 euros, respectively.\n\nAccording to the study by Amedeo Spadaro, the figures per region would be: Andalusia, 7,855,550 euros; Aragon, 1,588,270; Asturias, 1,297,916; the Canary Islands, 2,391,777; Cantabria, 743,931; Castile and Leon, 2,277,062; Castile-La Mancha, 2,152,575; Community of Valencia, 5,130,095; Galicia, 4,810,626; Murcia, 2,356,580; Navarra, 825,344,; Basque Country, 3,650,757; La Rioja, 387,370; Ceuta, 125,583, and Melilla, 147,669.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["", "Marca English"], "tags": ["Marca English"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Mar 25 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe will hit Spanish football at all levels, not just the highest.Now, a study has...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.marca.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"keywords": ",Marca English", "news_keywords": ",Marca English", "robots": "index,follow", "theme-color": "#CC0000", "organization": "Unidad Editorial Informaci\u00f3n Deportiva S.L.", "DC.date.issued": "2020-03-25T19:59:51Z", "date": "2020-03-25T19:59:49Z", "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-25T19:59:49Z", "modified_time": "2020-03-25T19:59:51Z", "section": "En/football/spanish-football", "tag": "Marca English"}, "twitter": {"site": "@MarcainEnglish", "creator": "@MarcainEnglish", "title": "Spanish grassroots football to lose 53 million euros a month due to coronavirus pandemic", "description": "The economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe will hit Spanish football at all levels, not just the highest.Now, a study has...", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2020/03/25/15851371557749.jpg"}, "description": "The economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe will hit Spanish football at all levels, not just the highest.Now, a study has...", "og": {"title": "Spanish grassroots football to lose 53 million euros a month due to coronavirus pandemic", "description": "The economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe will hit Spanish football at all levels, not just the highest.Now, a study has...", "url": "https://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2020/03/25/5e7bb7ac268e3e214e8b4578.html", "image": "https://e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2020/03/25/15851371557749.jpg", "type": "article", "site_name": "MARCA in English"}, "fb": {"app_id": 135978896526107}, "referrer": "unsafe-url"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2020/03/25/5e7bb7ac268e3e214e8b4578.html"}
