The New York Police Department has known these police impersonators have existed for quite a while now and done absolutely nothing about it. However, according to a report, the Muslim Community Patrol & Services (MCP&S) of Brooklyn, New York handed over a former employee to the Bloods gang, who beat him for over half an hour. That\u2019s right, this is not the Middle East. This is America!\n\nThe story comes from the Christian Action Network\u2019s Martin Mawyer.\n\nHe writes:\n\nIn the most recent, tense step in a simmering feud, Muslim Community Patrol & Services (MCP&S) of Brooklyn, N.Y. handed over a former employee to the Bloods gang who was then punched, kicked and body-slammed to the ground in a grueling 31-minute battering, according to a witness.\n\nThe fired worker was surrendered over to the Bloods on Dec. 29 in an attempt to settle a nearly three-week long dispute between the two groups. The feud began on Dec. 10 after the former MCP&S employee threw a teenage boy against a fence for verbally \u201cdisrespecting\u201d a Muslim woman near a Brooklyn mosque.\n\nUnbeknownst to the MCP&S \u201cpatrolman,\u201d the teen was the son of a high-ranking member of the notoriously violent and vindictive Bloods gang on Gates Avenue in Brooklyn.\n\nFollowing the assault, the Bloods immediately declared all members of MCP&S, including the congregants and leaders of Masjid Taqwa (seen as controlling MCP&S) as \u201cfood\u201d for their \u201cdogs.\u201d\n\nThe first act of retaliation came only a few days after the initial encounter, when Bloods members severely beat a random Muslim man outside the Masjid Taqwa on Fulton Street. The injured man was taken to Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center for emergency medical care.\n\nIn an effort to prevent future Bloods violence, leaders of the patrol services fired the MCP&S worker and arranged for a sit-down at the home of the offended father and his teenage son.\n\nDuring the meeting, described as \u201ctense\u201d by an observer, the Bloods demanded MCP&S either physically hand over the MCP&S worker or provide the Bloods with his address. That request was at first rejected by Ali Karim, serving as a lieutenant under the command of radical Islamic cleric Siraj Wahhaj of Masjid Taqwa.\n\nA few days later, however, Imam Wahhaj overruled Karim\u2019s rejection of the Bloods\u2019 offer and instructed him to deliver the ex-MCP&S worker to the Bloods, with the stipulation that the fired worker would be subjected only to a \u201cfistfight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn eye for an eye,\u201d is how one associate of Siraj Wahhaj characterized the agreement to Christian Action Network. \u201cThat MCP worker threw the boy violently against a fence. He then held on to the back of his neck. That was wrong. And he needed to be punished for it. The Quran teaches an eye for an eye for punishment. Nothing more. So that was the agreement. The Bloods could set up a fight to punch him, but that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThe fight was set for 9 p.m. on Dec. 29 near the headquarters of the Gates Avenue Bloods gang, though the actual gathering was delayed by an hour.\n\nThe ex-worker was accompanied by eight armed Muslims and was delivered to five armed members of the Bloods at around 10 p.m.\n\nIn a fight reminiscent of a scene from West Side Story, the Bloods stood on one side of a school playground while Muslims stood on the opposite end. The two combatants were positioned between the factions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a fight like that in all my life,\u201d one observer told Christian Action Network. \u201cThey fought for 31 minutes, because that\u2019s the rule of the Bloods, you fight for 31 minutes.\u201d\u2026\n\nAs we previously reported, the MCP\u2019s are increasing from a mere 3 patrol cars to 30 in 2020.\n\nThe obvious question remains to Mayor Bill DeBlasio and the New York Police Department: Why are you allowing the impersonation of police officers by Muslims? By doing so, you do realize you are aiding and abetting felonies in your city?\n\nPeople need to hold these criminals accountable, and I\u2019m not just talking about the Muslims here.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Tim Brown", "Tim Brown Is An Author", "Editor At"], "publish_date": "Sat Jan  4 21:48:14 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "google-site-verification": "_tVnovo_FmTsRKnpQzNPnUeWMzAQWycxVau9huTNMcA", "robots": "noimageindex", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Sharia \"Justice\" In New York: Unauthorized Muslim Community Patrol Hands Over Former Employee To Bloods Gang For Beating", "description": "And who is responsible for this?\u00a0 The New York Police Department has known these police impersonators have existed for quite a while now and done absolutely nothing about it.\u00a0 However, according to a report, the Muslim Community Patrol & Services (MCP&S) of Brooklyn, New York handed over a former employee to the Bloods gang, who \u2026", "url": "https://sonsoflibertymedia.com/sharia-justice-in-new-york-unauthorized-muslim-community-patrol-hands-over-former-employee-to-bloods-gang-for-beating/", "site_name": "Sons of Liberty Media", "image": {"identifier": "https://sonsoflibertymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MCP-car-in-Brooklyn.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 405}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SonsofLibertyMedia", "published_time": "2020-01-04T21:48:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-05T13:02:56+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@http://twitter.com/FPPTim", "site": "@BradleeDean1", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Tim Brown", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.5.3", "fb": {"app_id": 459853634156712, "pages": 289189664545158}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "googlebot": "noimageindex"}, "canonical_link": "https://sonsoflibertymedia.com/sharia-justice-in-new-york-unauthorized-muslim-community-patrol-hands-over-former-employee-to-bloods-gang-for-beating/"}
