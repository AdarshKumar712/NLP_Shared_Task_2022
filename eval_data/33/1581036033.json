This is due to the role he had in managing the crisis and unifying the local population under a discourse of maturity and social responsibility. Some voters even consider him to be the \u2018ideal politician,\u2019 even amongst voter demographics who never give the Liberals their vote.\n\n-- Advertisement --\n\n\n\nWhen speaking to Europe, Rutte talks about numbers with a cold mind and a calculator in his hand. When he speaks to his country, he speaks about optimism and empathy giving messages of closeness, unity and solidarity. He can be seen visiting a supermarket and making jokes with the staff or partaking in a gym lesson for one of the few open schools which caters for the children of essential workers fighting against Covid-19.\n\nRutte has injected billions of euros into the country\u2019s economy, including aid for the self-employed and economic help for those individuals who have lost their jobs during the crisis. It has mobilised banks to show solidarity with those unable to pay their mortgage and homeowners to be patient with distressed tenants.\n\n\u201cI am aware of how big the impact is. There is fear, people feel lonely, and I know we shouldn\u2019t stretch it [confinement] more than is necessary. But it is important that we continue to honour the agreements for now. We are still at the beginning.\u201d The Prime Minister acknowledges.\n\nRutte is aware that the pressure on the hospitals is still high enough to put off talking about de-escalation of the measures. \u201cThe metre and a half safety distance will continue with us for much longer,\u201d he added, about the interpersonal distance to keep on the street. For now, this will continue at least until April 28.\n\nHis position is summed up in a few words: \u201cI am not going to decree anything, this is the danger we face and we only emerge from this if the 17 million inhabitants adhere to the rules.\u201d\n\nHis choice to not decree a State of Alarm, he argues, is because it is of no use if the population does not all agree that they have to get out of this crisis together and put in the effort.\n\nHe has been defined as a politician who treats his people with maturity. He shows full confidence in his population, who in the end has stayed at home and has respected social distancing, and this has been precisely what has earned Rutte his popularity and confidence.\n\n\u201cI am very proud of you,\u201d Rutte told the Dutch society after many were locked up at home out of responsibility, despite the sun and good weather. In Holland, you can still go for a walk, run or take the kids to the park without receiving a fine.\n\nThis liberal politician is already planning for the course of the nation after the health emergency. \u201cGood health care, good education, and solid public facilities. That is why I work as a liberal.\u201d The election campaign statement that will resonate in the minds of many voters in March 2021.\n\nWith less than a year to go until the 2021 general election, analysts see The Netherland\u2019s position in Brussels as a strategy to flirt with far-right voters. Traditionally these right-wing voters are reluctant to matters concerning the European Union and very critical of the use of Dutch money to help southern countries. This, along with immigration policy, is the backbone of the Baudet\u2019s far-right\u2019s electoral campaign, which last year made his party the largest in the Dutch Senate. Today, the polls forecast three seats less for his party in the next elections.\n\nAlthough the attitude and actions of Dutch Finance Minister, Wopke Hoekstra, were also widely criticised within The Netherlands, causing him to apologise for appearing selfish and unsympathetic, the content of his argument and his overall stance received a favourable amount of support in the Dutch Parliament.\n\nThe \u201cno to the coronabonos\u201d was practically shouted in unison in The Hague and Hoekstra promised the House of Representatives that the use of ESM funds, if not for the purchase of medical supplies against Covid-19, will not be touched. Spain and Italy will have to commit to immediate reforms of their economy to receive financial aid.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Euro Weekly News", "Why is Holland\u2019s Government so Stern with Spain?
