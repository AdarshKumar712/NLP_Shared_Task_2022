Andrew Cuomo, state authorities are working against the clock to try and expand hospital capacity to handle the wave of Covid-19 patients that is already coming to health centers and which is expected to multiply in the coming days.\n\nNot far from the Comfort, which is docked on a pier in the middle of Manhattan Island\u2019s western shore, expectations are that on Monday the National Guard\u2019s 1,000-bed emergency hospital established in the huge Jacob Javits Convention Center will also begin treating patients.\n\nIn addition, it is expected that four other emergency health centers in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and The Bronx will also begin operating, meaning that five of the city\u2019s boroughs will have specially augmented coronavirus healthcare coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, this past weekend, a 68-bed tent hospital was being established in Central Park to enhance the capacity of Mt. Sinai West Hospital, which is located nearby. The white tents of the field hospital are being set up by volunteers from a Christian organization and the facility is expected to be up and running by Tuesday.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 31 00:18:32 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "es", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "es_ES", "type": "article", "title": "Hospital ship Comfort arrives in New York to help in fight against COVID-19 - Laredo Daily News", "description": "New York.- The Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort docked on Monday at the Manhattan pier to upgrade the capabilities of [\u2026]", "url": "https://laredodaily.news/hospital-ship-comfort-arrives-in-new-york-to-help-in-fight-against-covid-19/", "site_name": "Laredo Daily News", "image": {"identifier": "https://laredodaily.news/files/2020/03/Hospital.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 460}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/LaredoDaily/", "published_time": "2020-03-31T00:18:32+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 674814169383417}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@DailyNewsLaredo", "site": "@DailyNewsLaredo", "label1": "Escrito por", "data1": "rafa", "label2": "Tiempo de lectura", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress."}, "canonical_link": "https://laredodaily.news/hospital-ship-comfort-arrives-in-new-york-to-help-in-fight-against-covid-19/"}
