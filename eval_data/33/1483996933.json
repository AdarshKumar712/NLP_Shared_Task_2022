(AP) \u2014 Paul George and Kawhi Leonard had far more success passing the ball in the first half than they did shooting it \u2013 and the Clippers still put up nearly 60 points.\n\nThat, as Leonard pointed out afterward, bodes well for a franchise in serious pursuit of its first NBA championship.\n\nGeorge had 21 points with season highs of 11 rebounds and nine assists to shake off a slow start, and short-handed Los Angeles thumped the Sacramento Kings 105-87 on Tuesday.\n\nLeonard scored 14 of his 24 points in the third quarter to help the Clippers to their 14th consecutive win in Sacramento dating to 2013.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what championship teams are about,\u201d said Leonard, who led Toronto to the title a year ago before signing with the Clippers in hopes of bringing a banner to Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cGoing through playoff runs, the best players aren\u2019t going to play great some nights. It might be somebody off the bench or somebody (else) starting that has a big game that propels us to win.\u201d\n\nIvica Zubac added eight points and 13 rebounds and Maurice Harkless scored 12 points for the Clippers. Los Angeles also got a big lift from Larry Shamet and Derrick Walton Jr., who combined for 19 points.\n\nThat was pivotal on a night when George shot 6 of 25 and Leonard was 8 of 21.\n\n\u201cWe just kind of hung in there,\u201d Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cWe went zone a little bit and changed our look. I just like our defense.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers played without Patrick Beverley and sixth man Lou Williams. Beverley is nursing a sprained right wrist he injured during Saturday night\u2019s loss in Utah, while Williams missed the game because of personal reasons.\n\nRichaun Holmes had 22 points and 10 rebounds for Sacramento. The Kings have lost eight straight.\n\n\u201cThey pushed us around out there and they had their way,\u201d Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. \u201cWe have to come together and we\u2019ve got to be mentally stronger, physically stronger and fight our way out of it. That\u2019s the only way to get out of this type of slump that we\u2019re in, and we\u2019ve done it before.\u201d\n\nThree days after a 13-point loss to Utah, Los Angeles took control in the first half despite both George and Leonard struggling offensively. The All-Stars missed 17 of their first 24 shots combined.\n\nBoth got going after the break.\n\nLeonard made five of seven shots in the third quarter, and George \u2013 who missed eight of his first nine shots beyond the arc \u2013 made a 3 to open the fourth. George added another 3-pointer later that put the Clippers ahead 103-86.\n\n\u201cI had the mindset of just go and attack, be aggressive, be physical,\u201d George said. \u201cI got the spots I wanted to. I got to the shots I wanted to. But it\u2019s just that stretch for me right now where the ball\u2019s not going down.\u201d\n\nEven with Leonard and George struggling most of the first half, the Clippers still built a big lead on the slumping Kings late in the second quarter. Shamet\u2019s 3-pointer gave Los Angeles a 57-40 halftime lead.\n\nLeonard got going in the third and the Clippers went on a 9-2 run to extend their lead to 19. Montrezl Harrell tipped in an offensive rebound then made a pair of free throws that made it 85-66.\n\nWIN, THEN LOSE, THEN WIN\n\nThe Clippers have alternated wins and losses over the past nine games. George said that\u2019s indicative of a team with new players still trying to adjust. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably got one game under our belt where everybody\u2019s been healthy,\u201d George said. \u201cWe\u2019re still learning each other. Our winning streak\u2019s going to come, sooner than later I believe.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nClippers: Beverley was injured Saturday against Utah. Although X-rays taken on his wrist were negative, Beverley is expected to miss a handful of games.\n\nKings: De\u2019Aaron Fox had nine points and six assists after sitting out most of two games because of back spasms. \u2026 Sacramento\u2019s losing streak is its longest since an eight-game stretch two seasons ago.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nClippers: Return to Los Angeles to play Detroit on Thursday.\n\nKings: Host Memphis on Thursday. Sacramento has won two straight home games against the Grizzlies but was beaten 119-115 on Dec. 21 in Memphis.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["taexclude", "los anageles clippers", "sacramento kings", "nba", "basketball"], "tags": ["Los Angeles Clippers", "Golf"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Paul George and Kawhi Leonard had far more success passing the ball in the first half than they did shooting it \u2013 and the Clippers still put up nearly 60 points.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909776/2019/07/cropped-sacramento-favicon-512_white.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "taexclude, los anageles clippers, sacramento kings, nba,  basketball", "keywords": "taexclude, los anageles clippers, sacramento kings, nba,  basketball", "fb": {"pages": 58388190670}, "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"title": "Clippers Beat Kings 105-87", "image": {"identifier": "https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909776/2019/07/kings-throwback-logo.jpg?w=1280", "secure_url": "https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909776/2019/07/kings-throwback-logo.jpg?w=1280", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Paul George and Kawhi Leonard had far more success passing the ball in the first half than they did shooting it \u2013 and the Clippers still put up nearly 60 points.", "type": "article", "url": "https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2019/12/31/clippers-kings-paul-george-kawhi-leonard/"}, "article": {"published_time": "2019-12-31T21:15:01+00:00", "suggested-social-copy": "Paul George and Kawhi Leonard had far more success passing the ball in the first half than they did shooting it \u2013 and the Clippers still put up nearly 60 points.", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSSacramento/", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSSacramento/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909776/2019/07/kings-throwback-logo.jpg?w=1280", "title": "Clippers Beat Kings 105-87", "description": "Paul George and Kawhi Leonard had far more success passing the ball in the first half than they did shooting it \u2013 and the Clippers still put up nearly 60 points.", "site": "/cbssacramento"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909776/2019/07/cropped-sacramento-favicon-512_white.png?w=270", "description": "Paul George and Kawhi Leonard had far more success passing the ball in the first half than they did shooting it \u2013 and the Clippers still put up nearly 60 points."}, "canonical_link": "https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2019/12/31/clippers-kings-paul-george-kawhi-leonard/"}
