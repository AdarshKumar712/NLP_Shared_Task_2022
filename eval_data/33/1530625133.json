Mashrafe missed the three-match ODI series in\n\nSri Lanka after the World Cup due to hamstring injury.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything like that Mashrafe won\u2019t be the part of the team\n\nafter the Zimbabwe series. I said that we will take a decision about the\n\ncaptain in the next board meeting,\u201d Papon said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say before the meeting that whether he [Mashrafe] would play or\n\nnot, or whether he would be captain or not. Till this series against\n\nZimbabwe, he is okay and he will be the captain.\u201d\n\nMashrafe is currently playing just ODI format of the cricket and since he\n\nshows his reluctance to walk into sunset in the near future, question came to\n\nthe fore whether he will play the one-off ODI against Pakistan in Karachi.\n\nPapon remained tightlipped on this issue, saying, \u201cBefore the ODI against\n\nPakistan, a board meeting will be held. As I said earlier, everything will be\n\ndecided in that meeting.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.bssnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BSS-logo-red-2.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "http://www.bssnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mashrafe.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.0.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.bssnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cropped-BSS-Final-Logo-300x300.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.bssnews.net/?p=353616"}
