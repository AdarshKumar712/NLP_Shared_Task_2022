REGAN\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo said he was delaying the state\u2019s presidential primary from April 28 to June 23, when the state plans to hold legislative congressional and local party primaries.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to be bringing people to one location to vote\u201d on the April date, he said.\n\nNew York joins over a dozen states that have delayed some elections. A smaller group including Ohio, Georgia, Louisiana, Connecticut, Maryland, Rhode Island, Indiana and Kentucky have also postponed their presidential primaries.\n\nThe governor\u2019s decision came as election commissioners across New York warned they were \u201crisking\u201d their health and safety to meet impending deadlines for testing machines and preparing ballots ahead of the April 28 date.\n\nCopyright 2020 PBS NewsHour.
