They suggest that within the incubation period, which is between one and 14 days, that somebody who has been exposed to the virus could potentially transmit it toe another person in those two weeks time. That calls into question some of the airport and rail security screenings that we've seen underway. Even happening at air at hotels as well, where they essentially wanna check temperature as soon as somebody either enters a location or they arrive at a location. So are they really gonna be that effective if this incubation period last up to 14 days and transmission can still happen in that period of time? Nonetheless, they're moving forward with those. Also on Monday, national health officials here came forward with some new concerns that they're raising and plans to tackle those that has to do with migrant and roll workers in particular. This is a holiday time. It's the Spring Festival. You've got a lot of folks who have left the big cities to go back to their home provinces. Well, the concern is that they're gonna be coming back in, masses hundreds of millions. So there's an education campaign of sorts that's underway right now, spearheaded by the central government and the National Health Commission, in which they're trying to raise awareness as to how this disease could be potentially stopped and being spread, and certain hygiene efforts that could be undertaken by those individuals now moving forward. The health Commission has also said that plans are still moving forward rather quickly with the construction of not one but two new hospitals. Within the next two weeks time, they're expected to hold more than 2000 people, and we know that both of those hospitals are underway, according to state media. And that is part of the centralized quarantine efforts that President Xi Jinping himself has made clear he wants to see put into action David Cole for Beijing.\n\nAdvertisement Woman who visited Iran is New York's first case of COVID-19 Share Shares Copy Link Copy\n\nNew York City has its first confirmed case of the new coronavirus that has sickened people around the globe, state officials announced Sunday.The sick person was a woman in her late 30s who contracted the virus while traveling in Iran, Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s office said.GET THE LATEST: Download the MyNBC5 appShe is currently self-quarantined in her Manhattan home. The woman has respiratory symptoms, \u201cbut is not in serious condition and has been in a controlled situation since arriving in New York,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said.The statement didn\u2019t say when the woman returned to the city after her travels, though a statement from Mayor Bill de Blasio said the travel was recent.\u201cThere is no reason for undue anxiety \u2014 the general risk remains low in New York. We are diligently managing this situation and will continue to provide information as it becomes available,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement.Local health authorities \u201chave been in a state of high alert for weeks, and are fully prepared to respond,\u201d De Blasio said in a statement late Sunday.People believed to have been in close contact with the woman have already been identified, city Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said.The test confirming the woman\u2019s illness was done at New York\u2019s Wadsworth Lab in Albany, rather than the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It came just a day after the state lab got federal permission to begin testing for the virus. Previously, tests on New York patients were still being handled only by federal authorities.Health authorities had previously tested more than 30 New York patients who have reported symptoms consistent with the virus, but until now each suspected case had proven to be a false alarm.More than 80,000 cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, have occurred worldwide since the virus emerged in China. About 3,000 people have died. The illness is characterized by fever and coughing and in serious cases shortness of breath or pneumonia.Rhode Island also confirmed its first case of the illness on Sunday, the same day that researchers said the virus may have been circulating in Washington state for weeks undetected.Cuomo and other state and city officials had said the emergence of a New York case was considered inevitable, given the city\u2019s role as a hub of international travel.While there is no evidence yet that the virus has been spreading in New York among people who haven\u2019t traveled, the addition of the city to the list of places with confirmed cases of the virus seemed likely to raise anxiety and potentially pose a threat to tourism.New Yorkers and the city\u2019s millions of visitors spend their days in close proximity to each other. City officials have, for weeks, been urging people to frequently wash their hands and avoid touching their faces to cut down on the risk of catching an illness. They have also urged calm, saying repeatedly that the risk to most New Yorkers is low.\u201cAs we confront this emerging outbreak, we need to separate facts from fear, and guard against stigma and panic,\u201d Barbot said.\u2014-This story has been corrected to reflect that Barbot is the city\u2019s health commissioner, not the state\u2019s.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["coronavirus", "new york"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon Mar  2 16:35:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/htv_default_image/wptz/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#2c2c2c", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.mynbc5.com/article/woman-who-visited-iran-is-new-yorks-first-case-of-covid-19/31190261", "site_name": "WPTZ", "title": "Woman who visited Iran is New York's first case of COVID-19", "description": "", "image": {"identifier": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/chinatopix-1583165991.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.846xh;0,0.0293xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 800, "height": 533}}, "x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=5", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.mynbc5.com/article/woman-who-visited-iran-is-new-yorks-first-case-of-covid-19/31190261", "site": "@MyNBC5", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "wptz", "ipad": "wptz"}, "id": {"iphone": 505486083, "ipad": 505486083, "googleplay": "com.hearst.wptziphone"}, "url": {"iphone": "wptz://content/31190261", "ipad": "wptz://content/31190261", "googleplay": "wptz://content/31190261"}}, "image": {"identifier": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/chinatopix-1583165991.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.846xh;0,0.0293xh&resize=640:*", "alt": "Nurses assemble plastic face shields at a hospital designated for the coronavirus patients in Wuhan in central China's Hubei province, Sunday, March 1, 2020.
