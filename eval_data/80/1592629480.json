S\u00e1nchez\u2019s coalition government, which is made up of the Socialist Party (PSOE) and left-wing party Unidas Podemos currently relies on the support of the opposition parties in order to pass legislation. However, the opposition parties, particularly Vox and PP, are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the government\u2019s lack of communication, particularly around the country\u2019s de-escalation plans.\n\nDuring the session in Congress today, the opposition parties also criticised the government\u2019s \u201ctransition to a new normal\u201d plan presented yesterday as \u201clacking in detail.\u201d Both the PP and Ciudadanos also complained that the government had not consulted these plans with them before announcing them.\n\nThe leader of the main opposition PP, Pablo Casado, also accused S\u00e1nchez of lying during the coronavirus crisis. He warned that his group may withhold his party\u2019s support at the upcoming vote for an additional extension to the State of Alarm, along with other opposition parties such as centre-right Ciudadanos party, The Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) and right-wing Vox. \u201cDon\u2019t count on us if things carry on like this,\u201d Casado warned S\u00e1nchez in Congress today.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Spain\u2019s opposition parties threaten to file lawsuits against Spain\u2019s PM & government for 'criminal offences\u2019 during Covid-19 crisis & withhold support for another lockdown extension", "Spain news", "Spain lockdown"], "authors": ["Share Your Story With Us Emailing", "Please Enter Your Name Here"], "publish_date": "Wed Apr 29 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Leading politicians from Spain's opposition parties of Partido Popular (PP) and Vox have threatened to file lawsuits against the government for criminal", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/identicon-1-150x150.gif?x26028", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Leading politicians from Spain's opposition parties of Partido Popular (PP) and Vox have threatened to file lawsuits against the government for criminal", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Spain\u2019s opposition parties threaten to file lawsuits against PM & government for 'criminal offences\u2019 during Covid-19 crisis & withhold support for another lockdown extension", "description": "Leading politicians from Spain's opposition parties of Partido Popular (PP) and Vox have threatened to file lawsuits against the government for criminal", "url": "https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2020/04/29/spains-opposition-parties-threaten-to-file-lawsuits-against-spains-pm-government-for-criminal-offences-during-covid-19-crisis-withhold-support-for-another-lock/", "site_name": "Euro Weekly News Spain", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/pedro-sanchez-ktOC-620x349@abc.jpg?x26028", "width": 620, "height": 349}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/EuroWeeklyNews", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/EuroWeeklyNews/", "published_time": "2020-04-29T19:37:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-04-30T07:17:41+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 181067459001980}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/euroweeklynews", "site": "@euroweeklynews"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 1.0.65.1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/identicon-1.gif?x26028", "theme-color": "#d33"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2020/04/29/spains-opposition-parties-threaten-to-file-lawsuits-against-spains-pm-government-for-criminal-offences-during-covid-19-crisis-withhold-support-for-another-lock/"}
