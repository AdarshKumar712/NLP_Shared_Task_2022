The total number of infections ranks third globally. But experts believe the government is likely vastly underreporting the number of cases, and fear what will follow.\n\nDo you believe that Brazil will become the next global epicenter for this pandemic?\n\nLuiz Inacio Lula da Silva (through translator): I think Brazil runs the risk of becoming the next epicenter of the pandemic.\n\nThe country alone has more people contaminated and deaths than all of South America.
