It\u2019s hoped the potential treatment, known as convalescent plasma, will help patients whose bodies are not producing sufficient antibodies to fight the virus.\n\nThe hospital said if the trials prove the treatment to be effective, NHS Blood and Transplant will begin a national programme to deliver up to 10,000 units of convalescent plasma per week to the NHS. It would be enough to treat 5,000 patients each week.\n\nThe trial is co-led by Dr Manu Shankar-Hari, a consultant in intensive care medicine at the hospital, along with experts from NHS Blood and Transplant and the University of Cambridge. Dr Shankar-Hari said:\n\nAs a new disease, there are no proven drugs to treat critically ill patients with Covid-19. Providing critically ill patients with plasma from patients who have recovered\u2026 could improve their chances of recovery\n\nHealth and social care secretary Matt Hancock said:\n\nThe UK has world-leading life sciences and research sectors and I have every hope this treatment will be a major milestone in our fight against this disease.
