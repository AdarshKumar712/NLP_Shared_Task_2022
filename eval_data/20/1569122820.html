       "articleBody": "&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday spoke to leaders of the US, Spain and Brazil and conveyed condolences for the loss of lives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and Spain are the two of the world&amp;#39;s most affected countries by the novel coronavirus. While the highest death toll has been recorded by Italy (15,362), highest number of cases has been seen in the US.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a call with US President Donald Trump, the two leaders exchanged views on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the global well-being and economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modi conveyed deep condolences for the loss of lives in the United States, and his prayers for early recovery of those still suffering from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stressing the special relationship between the two countries, the Prime Minister reiterated India&amp;rsquo;s solidarity with the USA in overcoming this global crisis together, the government said in a statement. The two leaders agreed to deploy the full strength of the India &amp;ndash; US partnership to resolutely and effectively combat COVID-19, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modi and Trump exchanged notes on the respective steps taken in each country for mitigating the health and economic impacts of the pandemic, the government said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two leaders also touched upon the significance of practices such as Yoga and Ayurveda for ensuring physical and mental well-being in these difficult times, it added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They agreed that their officials would remain in close touch with respect to the global COVID-19 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, which has now become the epicentre of the coronavirus, has recorded over 3 lakh cases or more than 25% of the total global cases of COVID-19.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Johns Hopkins University tracker, the US has recorded 311,357 cases and 8,452 deaths from COVID-19.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modi also held a telephonic conversation with Pedro Sanchez Perez-Castejon, President of the Government (equivalent to Prime Minister) of Spain. Modi conveyed his deepest condolences for the tragic loss of lives in Spain, and offered his prayers for the speedy recovery of those still suffering from the disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The death toll in Spain reached 11,947 on Sunday with over 126,000 cases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two leaders discussed the global challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister assured the Spanish dignitary that India stands in solidarity with the heroic Spanish efforts, and would be ready to extend support to the best of its ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two leaders agreed on the importance of international cooperation for fighting the global health crisis. The Spanish Prime Minister agreed with Prime Minister&amp;rsquo;s observation that the world needed to define a new, human-centric concept of globalisation for the post-COVID era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two leaders also agreed on the utility of yoga and traditional herbal medicines for providing an easily accessible means of ensuring the psychological and physical health of people confined to their homes due to the pandemic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They agreed that their teams would remain in constant touch with respect to the evolving COVID-19 situation and the requirements emerging from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modi also had a telephonic conversation Brazil President Jair Messias Bolsonaro.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two leaders stressed the significance of close cooperation between India and Brazil, bilaterally as well as in the multilateral institutional framework, to mitigate the grave crises caused by COVID-19.&amp;nbsp; They agreed on the need to forge a new human-centric concept of globalisation for the post-COVID world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil has recorded over 10,000 cases and 445 deaths due to coronavirus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of coronavirus cases worldwide crossed 12 lakh with close to 65,000 deaths on Sunday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India, the number of total cases is 3072, according to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. While 74 people have died of the disease, 213 have been discharged after treatment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"
