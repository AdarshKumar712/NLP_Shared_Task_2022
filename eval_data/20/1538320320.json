According to The Times, one person in the group waved a Puerto Rican flag and called for independence for the country as the attack unfolded.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Cancel Miranda and the others in the group were prepared to die when carrying out the attack. They also maintain that they were not aiming to kill specific lawmakers.\n\n\"No congressman, in particular, was the target,\" Cancel Miranda said upon his release, according to The New York Times. \"It was just an effort to shoot up the place. If we aimed to kill, believe me, that would have happened.\"\n\nCancel Miranda and three others \u2014 Lolita Lebr\u00f3n, Irvin Flores Rodr\u00edguez and Andres Figueroa Cordero \u2014 received lengthy prison sentences for carrying out the attack. Cordero died of cancer in 1979, but President Jimmy Carter commuted the group's sentences in 1979.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Cancel Miranda ran a family furniture store upon his release from prison. He died Monday at his home in San Juan.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Rafael Cancel Miranda", "Cancel Miranda obit", "Cancel Miranda", "Rafael Cancel Miranda dies", "Rafael Cancel Miranda obit"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Mar  4 13:13:35 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Rafael Cancel Miranda, one of four people who opened fire at the United States Capitol building in 1954 in the name of independence for Puerto Rico, died Monday at the age of 89, according to The New York Times  and The Washington Post.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Rafael Cancel Miranda, one of four people who opened fire at the United States Capitol building in 1954 in the name of independence for Puerto Rico, died Monday at the age of 89, according to The New York Times  and The Washington Post.", "keywords": "Rafael Cancel Miranda,Cancel Miranda obit,Cancel Miranda,Rafael Cancel Miranda dies,Rafael Cancel Miranda obit", "brightspot.contentId": "00000170-a5ae-de8a-a7f0-bdff22a40000", "og": {"title": "Rafael Cancel Miranda: Man who shot up Congress in '54 in name of independence for Puerto Rico dead at 89", "url": "https://www.kjrh.com/news/national/rafael-cancel-miranda-man-who-shot-up-congress-in-54-in-name-of-independence-for-puerto-rico-dead-at-89", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e1a237/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1000x525+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F19%2Ff2%2F63a9ef7b48a684517230bd53b944%2Fcancel-miranda.png", "url": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e1a237/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1000x525+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F19%2Ff2%2F63a9ef7b48a684517230bd53b944%2Fcancel-miranda.png", "secure_url": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e1a237/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1000x525+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F19%2Ff2%2F63a9ef7b48a684517230bd53b944%2Fcancel-miranda.png", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/png", "alt": "Rafael Cancel Miranda: Man who shot up Congress in '54 in name of independence for Puerto Rico dead at 89"}, "description": "Rafael Cancel Miranda, one of four people who opened fire at the United States Capitol building in 1954 in the name of independence for Puerto Rico, died Monday at the age of 89, according to The New York Times  and The Washington Post.", "site_name": "KJRH", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-04T13:13:35", "modified_time": "2020-03-04T13:26:02", "section": "National", "tag": "National"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Rafael Cancel Miranda, one of four people who opened fire at the United States Capitol building in 1954 in the name of independence for Puerto Rico, died Monday at the age of 89, according to The New York Times  and The Washington Post.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e1a237/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1000x525+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F19%2Ff2%2F63a9ef7b48a684517230bd53b944%2Fcancel-miranda.png", "alt": "Rafael Cancel Miranda: Man who shot up Congress in '54 in name of independence for Puerto Rico dead at 89"}, "site": "@KJRH2HD", "title": "Rafael Cancel Miranda: Man who shot up Congress in '54 in name of independence for Puerto Rico dead at 89"}, "fb": {"app_id": 580325898666224}, "brightspot.cached": "true", "google-site-verification": "olHqSx4wwLsCYBRxleoqguW-cD4B7kae7OHCN9XB31k"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/national/rafael-cancel-miranda-man-who-shot-up-congress-in-54-in-name-of-independence-for-puerto-rico-dead-at-89"}
