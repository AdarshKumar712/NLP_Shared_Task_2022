Tyson also took out full-page ads in The Washington Post and Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.\n\n\u201cThe food supply chain is breaking,\u201d Tyson Foods warns in a full page ad in NYT today pic.twitter.com/5cyusH6L9V \u2014 Ana Swanson (@AnaSwanson) April 26, 2020\n\nJohn Tyson, chairman of the board of Tyson Foods wrote the letter, titled, \u201cA Delicate Balance: Feeding the Nation and Keeping Our Employees Healthy,\u201d which warns of a disruption in the food supply chain, as several of its facilities have been forced to close due to COVID outbreaks and employees taken with illness. Tyson writes \u201cAs pork, beef and chicken plants are being forced to close, even for short periods of time, millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain. As a result, there will be limited supply of our products available in grocery stores until we are able to reopen our facilities that are currently closed.\u201d\n\nThe letter also goes on to make note of the changes it\u2019s made to keep workers safe, as well as helping those who have come down with the virus.\n\nTyson promised \u201cwaiving the waiting period to qualify for short-term disability so workers can immediately be paid if they get sick\u2026waiving the co-pay, co-insurance and deductible for doctor visits for COVID-19 testing\u2026waiving co-pays for the use of telemedicine.\u201d He also notes Tyson paying $60 million in \u201cthank you bonuses\u201d to their workers and truckers.\n\nPR Takeaways: The letter and paid delivery of the letter comes at an interesting time and raises a lot of questions. While the messaging promises to keep delivering fresh meat to Americans, it\u2019s honest about the possible downturn of supply, while acknowledging the safety of its workers. That\u2019s great, but why the need to deliver this message in a full-page ad? Why not run an awareness campaign or host a press conference?\n\nTyson also keeps the messaging very central, on themselves, while noting the impact this could have regarding food waste and local farmers working with the plant. Tyson seems to be forgetting that yes, while they are a behemoth in the meat industry, there are other options out there for buyers, especially as more look for local options and to help out small businesses. It comes across as a bit narcissistic almost, to think they are the only player in the game.\n\nThat self-centeredness also takes on another hurdle at the realization that a company like Tyson could afford a full-page ad in the nation\u2019s largest newspapers to talk about themselves, instead of using that money for something more useful. It brings up the notion that yes, a company with money CAN do this, while small businesses cannot. It may have benefited Tyson to use that space to recognize the farmers and small businesses they work with instead of focusing on their own issues.\n\nThe letter also talks about the safety of workers, but delivers it in such a tone of urgency, that it seems as though the company does not have the time to wait for workers to be well. It\u2019s wonderful that it\u2019s speeding up disability and waiving co-pays, but why did it wait until now to do this? What about the thousands of Tyson workers currently sick from the virus? The tone just seems to show a disregard for what families are going through and the real importance of workers as human beings. It fails to acknowledge past mistakes.\n\nThere are right ways and wrong ways to distribute important information to the public. Providing them with facts and figures, as well as solutions and empathy much like Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s New York state press briefings. Tyson chose to use a more alarming tactic, inciting panic and warning signals to those who fear for their everyday needs, such as the food supply. Tyson\u2019s goal in this action is unclear, but we\u2019re bound to find out in the coming weeks if it\u2019s paid off for its reputation.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Nicole Schuman"], "publish_date": "Mon Apr 27 21:40:01 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Tyson Foods may have unofficially announced the second wave of panic buying through a NYT advertorial for chicken and meat products.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.prnewsonline.com/wp-content/themes/prnewsonline/favicon-32x32.png?v=2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Tyson Foods may have unofficially announced the second wave of panic buying through a NYT advertorial for chicken and meat products.", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Tyson Foods' Messaging Goals Unclear in Full-Page NYT Advertorial", "description": "Tyson Foods may have unofficially announced the second wave of panic buying through a NYT advertorial for chicken and meat products.", "url": "https://www.prnewsonline.com/tyson-foods-messaging-goals-unclear-in-full-page-nyt-advertorial/", "site_name": "PRNEWS"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/prnews", "published_time": "2020-04-27T21:40:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-07-10T20:17:13+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@prnews", "site": "@prnews"}, "wp-parsely_version": "2.3"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.prnewsonline.com/tyson-foods-messaging-goals-unclear-in-full-page-nyt-advertorial/"}
