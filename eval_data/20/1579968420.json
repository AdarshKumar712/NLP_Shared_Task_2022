The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday said sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s gross domestic product would shrink this year by 1.6 percent due to the effects of the coronavirus, low oil prices and poor commodity prices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good opening for discussion. My belief is that until the end of this year will not be adequate. We need a two-year time scale,\u201d she said referring to the moratorium on Africa's debt. \u201cI think that is what will give African countries the breathing room to be able to deal with the enormous consequences of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nStephen Karingi, director of the trade division at the U.N.'s Economic Commission for Africa, said support from the international community should be \u201cweighed against the damage COVID-19 will cause\u201d in Africa.\n\n\u201cWe think that 2020 and 2021 will be difficult and support should have that in mind or such a horizon,\u201d Karingi said.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the Job Creation Commission has estimated 1.4 million jobs are likely to be lost over the next three months, according to a document seen by POLITICO.\n\nIn Europe, there are proponents for greater assistance to Africa. Officials in both France and Germany have said debt relief measures will likely need to be extended, while President Emmanuel Macron has spoken in favor of \u201cmassively canceling\u201d a portion of Africa\u2019s debt load.\n\nChina is less favorable to providing blanket relief to poor countries and prefers to operate bilaterally, according to two diplomats in Addis Ababa briefed on the talks. The China's mission to the African Union did not reply to questions on Africa\u2019s debt.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala said that while there is a standstill on payments the World Bank and IMF should study debt sustainability and come up with a framework where it could be restructured. And on the Chinese position, she said Beijing was \u201ccoming along.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it's against supporting African countries on this. I\u2019ve heard actually to the contrary,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we need from China is not a case-by-case examination, but an across-the-board agreement.\u201d\n\nFor the latest information and analysis on COVID-19 and its global implications sign up for POLITICO's Daily Coronavirus Update or update your preferences.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Space", "Employment & Immigration", "Canada", "Education", "Cartoon Carousel", "Agriculture", "Defense", "Cybersecurity"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Apr 16 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.politico.com/cf/05/ee684a274496b04fa20ba2978da1/politico.png", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "og": {"title": "Africa to G-20: Debt relief deal to ease coronavirus crisis not enough", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/16/africa-coronavirus-g20-debt-relief-190051", "description": "Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s gross domestic product is set to shrink this year by 1.6 percent, according to the IMF.", "image": "https://static.politico.com/49/0b/ec6cfa81490f8b163823f770a4ab/200416ngozi-okonjo-iweala-gty-773.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "site_name": "POLITICO"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#dc0228", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "twitter": {"title": "Africa to G-20: Debt relief deal to ease coronavirus crisis not enough", "image": "https://static.politico.com/49/0b/ec6cfa81490f8b163823f770a4ab/200416ngozi-okonjo-iweala-gty-773.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@politico", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "build": "2021-09-01T20:21:03Z"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-africa-to-g20-debt-relief-deal-to-heal-ease-crisis-not-enough/"}
