Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) has stopped accepting reusable cups from customers to prevent the spread of coronavirus, though it will still honor the promised discount for anyone carrying one.\n\nCompanies across the world are having to rethink the way they operate to slow the spread of a virus that first emerged in China, with some opting to freeze travel, stockpile goods and have staff work from home.\n\nFor Starbucks that means pausing the use of personal cups or tumblers in its stores out \u201cof an abundance of caution\u201d.\n\nCoffee chains have in recent years encouraged customers to bring their own reusable cups or thermal tumblers to cut the number of paper cups and plastic lids that end up in a landfill.\n\nREAD ALSO: First case of Coronavirus reported in Vatican\n\nMany offer discounts or increased loyalty stamps to promote the trend.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to honour existing discounts for anyone who brings in a personal cup,\u201d Starbucks said.\n\n\u201cAs a result, we are suspending our 5p (UK) and 5c (Germany) charges for paper cups as well, given this decision prevents customers from opting for reusables.\u201d\n\nvanguard\n\nKindly Share This Story:",
