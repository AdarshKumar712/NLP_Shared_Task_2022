China is a particularly big buyer of New Zealand dairy, wool, seafood and forestry products.\n\nAs well, last year New Zealand saw about 450,000 Chinese tourists visit, as well as almost 40,000 Chinese students come here. Because of the current restrictions, Ms Wu said she envisages those numbers \"dropping dramatically\".\n\nYour playlist will load after this ad\n\nShe wouldn't speculate on what those numbers could be, but added \"as we can see, there will be a severe impact or tourism, on education and on trade and also I believe on people's sentiment\".\n\n\"All these will have an impact, but in the mid- to long-term, we wait and see.\"\n\nNew Zealand and China have a food relationship, Ms Wu also said, adding that the Asian nation was our biggest trade partner. So she hopes the friendly feelings will be maintained from both sides she added.\n\n\"We have done a lot, last year in particular, to promote people-to-people exchanges,\" she said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["new-zealand", "one-news", "asia", "health", "air-travel", "economy", "education", "new-zealand", "one-news", "health"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Last year, 450,000 Chinese tourists and almost 40,000 students came here.
