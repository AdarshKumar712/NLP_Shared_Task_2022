So, a house in wheels doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea especially if you love to travel and would like to have the freedom to move anywhere in the world.\n\nFelix Starck and Selima Taibi from Expedition Happiness purchased a 20-year-old school bus online and turned it into their own tiny house. The couple lives in Germany, but once they found the bus in a location in the USA, they took the first plane and invested in their life-long dream.\n\nThey converted the back of the bus into a cozy little bedroom, the front of the bus into a living/dining area and the middle of the bus serves as the kitchen. Although the space is tiny, it has a dreamy and very cozy atmosphere, thanks to the use of natural colors and warm lights. There is also a very small bathroom, but it is more than enough for a young couple.\n\nThe best feature of the tiny house is that it can be moved anywhere, so the owners can enjoy breathtaking views of mountains, the seaside or forests.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\n\nMore ideas:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["dining", "Home Design", "cozy bedroom", "school bus", "Expedition Happiness", "living"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.goodshomedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/favicon1.ico", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "IT USED TO BE A SCHOOL BUS \u2026 NOW IT\u2019S A COZY LOFT ON WHEELS!", "description": "A school bus turned into a loft.
