Just kill me.\u201d This is the cry of one Uyghur man in Xinjiang, China, where the government has instituted a strict lockdown due to coronavirus concerns. Unable to help his starving family, the man begged for death in a recent viral video experts say is authentic.\n\nOne might have thought that things couldn\u2019t get worse for the oppressed, mostly-Muslim, Uyghur minority concentrated in the northwestern Uyghur region. Yet, the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) found a way to manipulate a health crisis and add to it a humanitarian crisis for the beleaguered Uyghur minority.\n\nLocal authorities began to impose a strict quarantine in parts of the region at the end of January, and reports suggest the locals were given no notice before the lockdown. Without advance warning or time to store food or other supplies, residents are still forbidden from leaving their homes. Now, they are running out of food and medical supplies.\n\nOne Uyghur woman anonymously described her family\u2019s situation to Radio Free Asia, saying, \u201c[The adults] are only eating one meal a day from morning to night\u201d since the lockdown started. \u201cEvery morning, we just worry about the children having something to eat.\u201d Without enough to eat, her eight-year-old daughter \u201cbecame dizzy and passed out,\u201d injuring her head when she fell.\n\nThis is just the latest in a long list of China\u2019s abuses against Uyghurs. The Chinese government operates what it calls \u201cVocational Education and Training Centers\u201d across the Xinjiang province, where an estimated 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities are forcibly detained, mistreated, pressured to cease their religious practices, and indoctrinated with communist propaganda.\n\nRecently leaked internal Chinese government documents reveal that Uyghurs can be sent to these re-education camps for just about any reason\u2014including following religious traditions, growing a beard, having too many kids, or owning a passport without having traveled.\n\nNow, Uyghurs fear that breaking quarantine will get them immediately detained in a camp. Even those with serious health problems unrelated to coronavirus are too afraid to violate the quarantine and leave their house to seek medical care.\n\nWhile the government might insist that the sudden and strict lockdown is meant to prevent the spread of coronavirus, which has caused at least two deaths in the region, an effective medical response does not require creating a new humanitarian crisis of mass hunger among residents. The answer to the threat of a dangerous new virus cannot be to starve people under implicit house arrest.\n\nIn responding to this crisis, time is of the essence. The Uyghur Human Rights Project has called upon the Red Cross of China, the International Red Cross, and the Red Crescent to request access to the Uyghur region so that they can conduct investigations and provide basic humanitarian relief such as food and medicine to residents who have been trapped.\n\nIt\u2019s clear the Chinese government will use any excuse it can to further oppress this small religious group. The U.S. should continue to criticize China\u2019s abuses against Uyghurs and other religious minorities. It\u2019s unacceptable that any country would treat its own people this way\u2014and the Chinese Communist Party must be made to understand that.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["frc", "family", "research", "council", "blog", "International Religious Liberty", "Religious Persecution", ""], "tags": ["Religious Persecution", "International Religious Liberty"], "authors": ["Arielle Del Turco"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "\u201cDo you want to kill me?
