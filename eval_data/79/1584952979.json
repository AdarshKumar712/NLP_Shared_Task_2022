The Newport Beach, California-based company will avoid conviction by improving its food safety.As part of the settlement, Chipotle said it has \"committed to continue enhancing its already robust food safety policies, practices, and procedures\" in addition to the fine.It comes after store-level employees\u2019 failed to follow company food safety protocols at company-owned restaurants in Los Angeles; Simi Valley, California; Boston; Sterling, Virginia; and Powell, Ohio, DOJ officials said.\"During the period from 2015 to 2018, store-level Chipotle employees, many of whom were teenagers and young adults, felt that they could not stay at home when they were sick,\" the Justice Department said. \"Due to the pressure of not wanting to let their teammates down, or of finding people to cover their work shifts, these employees reported feeling pressure to work while sick, even though this was against Chipotle\u2019s sick-exclusion policies.\"According to a legal filing, the company had admitted that \"From approximately 2015 to 2018, Chipotle faced at least five food safety incidents at various restaurants around the country, which stemmed primarily from store-level employees\u2019 failure to follow Chipotle\u2019s food safety policies and procedures, including the policy requiring the exclusion of restaurant employees who were sick or recently had been sick, as well as a failure by restaurant employees to hold food at appropriate temperatures to prevent and control for the growth of food-borne pathogens.\"In recent years, the company has introduced food safety policies and procedures to improve existing practices, seeking to lower the risk of food-borne illnesses. Measures have included creating a safety advisory council and \"reducing the number of employees who come into contact with ingredients, safeguards to minimize the risk that an ingredient is undercooked, and sophisticated microbiological testing of raw ingredients to help ensure quality and safety before they are shipped to restaurants,\" said Kerry Bridges, Chipotle's vice president of food safety.\u201cChipotle also traces the movement of each ingredient in our supply chain. If an ingredient does not meet our high standards, we can quickly determine when and where the problem occurred, and swiftly remove it before it enters our restaurants,\u201d Bridges said in a statement.The company also noted other initiatives its done over the past fews, including:Preventive systems and microbiological testing to control and monitor food safety risks before ingredients are shipped to restaurants;Detailed traceability of each ingredient in the supply chain;Requirement of every employee at the beginning of every work shift, and at least every hour thereafter or while changing tasks, to wash their hands and to use antibacterial soap and hand sanitizer;Hand sanitizer available for both employees and guests;Wellness checks for each employee before they clock in for work to ensure they do not have any symptoms of illness, and paid sick leave so no employee works while sick;Availability of trained nurses for around the clock consultation with any employee who may feel ill in order to determine whether they should be excluded from work, with full pay;Enhanced food preparation and food handling practices designed to reduce food safety risks; Improved internal training and education to ensure that all employees thoroughly understand the company\u2019s high standards for food safety and food handling;And engagement of a third-party consultant to perform quarterly inspections of all restaurants, among other measures. \u201cThis settlement represents an acknowledgment of how seriously Chipotle takes food safety every day and is an opportunity to definitively turn the page on past events and focus on serving our customers real food made with real ingredients that they can enjoy with confidence,\u201d said Brian Niccol Chipotle's chairman and CEO.The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["chipotle", "fine", "sickened", "dtnd", "payment", "$25 million"], "tags": [], "authors": ["National Desk Staff", "Https", "Www.Facebook.Com"], "publish_date": "Tue Apr 21 19:11:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Justice Department said it's the largest fine in a food safety case.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/htv_default_image/wxii/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#2c2c2c", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.wxii12.com/article/chipotle-agrees-to-pay-dollar25-million-after-1000-people-sickened-from-2015-2018/32226429", "site_name": "WXII", "title": "Chipotle agrees to pay $25 million after 1,000 people sickened from 2015-2018", "description": "The Justice Department said it's the largest fine in a food safety case.", "image": {"identifier": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/chipotle-ap-1502438533.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.846xh;0,0.0817xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 800, "height": 533}}, "x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=5", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.wxii12.com/article/chipotle-agrees-to-pay-dollar25-million-after-1000-people-sickened-from-2015-2018/32226429", "site": "@WXII", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "wxii", "ipad": "wxii"}, "id": {"iphone": 505569365, "ipad": 505569365, "googleplay": "com.hearst.wxiiiphone"}, "url": {"iphone": "wxii://content/32226429", "ipad": "wxii://content/32226429", "googleplay": "wxii://content/32226429"}}, "image": {"identifier": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/chipotle-ap-1502438533.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.846xh;0,0.0817xh&resize=640:*", "alt": "A Chipotle sign is displayed."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Chipotle agrees to pay $25 million after 1,000 people sickened from 2015-2018", "description": "The Justice Department said it's the largest fine in a food safety case."}, "fb": {"app_id": 127218623942, "pages": 156455171166325}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wxii12news", "modified_time": "2020-04-21T19:12:00.903583Z", "opinion": "false", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/", "published_time": "2020-04-21T19:11:00Z", "section": "News", "subsection": "National News"}, "google-site-verification": "Pn6Hwfvitp_jS6SeqOHxZ-O8xl9o316gH4tCSv1AInU", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=505569365, affiliate-data=1000lpD, app-argument=canonical", "msvalidate.01": "A645064CC349FEE2894B433087AB1839", "title": "Chipotle agrees to pay $25 million after 1,000 people sickened from 2015-2018", "description": "The Justice Department said it's the largest fine in a food safety case.", "keywords": "chipotle, fine, sickened, dtnd, payment, $25 million", "news_keywords": "chipotle, fine, sickened, dtnd, payment, $25 million", "sailthru.contentid": 32226429, "auto-publish": "timely", "sailthru.author": "National Desk Staff", "author": "National Desk Staff", "sailthru.image.full": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/chipotle-ap-1502438533.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.846xh;0,0.0817xh&resize=300:*", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/chipotle-ap-1502438533.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.846xh;0,0.0817xh&resize=50:50", "date": "2020-04-21T19:11:00Z", "datepublished": "2020-04-21T19:11:00Z", "datemodified": "2020-04-21T19:12:00.903583Z", "category": "National News", "sailthru.tags": "news,national-news", "parsely-link": "https://www.wdsu.com/article/chipotle-agrees-to-pay-dollar25-million-after-1000-people-sickened-from-2015-2018/32226429"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.wxii12.com/article/chipotle-agrees-to-pay-dollar25-million-after-1000-people-sickened-from-2015-2018/32226429"}
