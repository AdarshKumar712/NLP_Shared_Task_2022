We are a Country that, throughout our history, has looked to God for protection and strength in times like these.... ....No matter where you may be, I encourage you to turn towards prayer in an act of faith. Together, we will easily PREVAIL!\"\n\nThe White House announced Saturday that it is now conducting temperature checks on anyone who is in close contact with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe move is being taken out of an abundance of caution in response to the coronavirus outbreak, said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman.\n\nTrump and Pence attended an afternoon news conference at the White House, and Trump said he had his own temperature taken before speaking to reporters.\n\n\u201cIt was totally normal,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have been here. \u201d\n\nTrump has had multiple direct and indirect contacts with people who have tested positive for the pandemic virus. On Friday, he declared a state of emergency as schools and workplaces across the country shuttered, flights were canceled and Americans braced for war against the health threat.\n\nTrump spent time last weekend at his private club in Florida with at least three people who have now tested positive.\n\nThe Brazilian Embassy in Washington announced late Friday that the country\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires, Nestor Forster, tested positive after sitting at Trump\u2019s dinner table. So, too, have a top aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and an individual who attended a fundraiser Sunday with Trump, according to two Republican officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private health matters.\n\nTrump has been known to flout public health advice \u2014 and was eagerly shaking hands during an event Friday \u2014 but acknowledged he \u201cmost likely\u201d will be tested soon. The White House physician has indicated that Trump\u2019s interactions were low risk and testing was not necessary.\n\nA representative from the White House physician\u2019s office took the temperate of members of the media who were at the White House on Saturday, going around to each person and putting the device to their heads. A reporter with a suspected elevated temperature was not allowed into the briefing room for a news conference with Trump and Pence about the outbreak.\n\nPublic health officials say that individuals with a cough and elevated temperatures of 100.4 degrees or higher are deemed concerning.\n\nPence\u2019s spokeswoman, Katie Miller, tweeted that according to the White House Medical Unit, the temperature was taken three times over a 15 minute period and all three registered above the 1004. guidelines.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Nexstar Media Wire", "Stephanie Graflage", "Brittany Rall"], "publish_date": "Sun Mar 15 14:24:07 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The White House announced Saturday that it is now conducting temperature checks on anyone who is in close contact with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://fox4kc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/01/favicon.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The White House announced Saturday that it is now conducting temperature checks on anyone who is in close contact with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.", "google-site-verification": "IMc9GO9sOWQapKRQ7YNBAOnWgF_eEqdSCGBFLVSmAIw", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "p": {"domain_verify": "aa180836cf51f68a968102c5da3acfdf"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "President Trump declares Sunday, March 15 a National Day of Prayer amid coronavirus outbreak", "url": "https://fox4kc.com/news/president-trump-declares-sunday-march-15-a-national-day-of-prayer-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/", "description": "The White House announced Saturday that it is now conducting temperature checks on anyone who is in close contact with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.", "site_name": "FOX 4 Kansas City WDAF-TV | News, Weather, Sports", "image": {"identifier": "https://fox4kc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/03/GettyImages-1207148215-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1&resize=1280,720", "secure_url": "https://fox4kc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/03/GettyImages-1207148215-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1&resize=1280,720"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-15T14:24:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-15T14:24:08+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "President Trump declares Sunday, March 15 a National Day of Prayer amid coronavirus outbreak"}, "image": "https://fox4kc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/03/GettyImages-1207148215-1.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "President Trump declares Sunday, March 15 a National Day of Prayer amid coronavirus outbreak", "description": "The White House announced Saturday that it is now conducting temperature checks on anyone who is in close contact with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://fox4kc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/01/favicon.png?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "https://myfox8.com/news/president-trump-declares-sunday-march-15-a-national-day-of-prayer-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/"}
