Obstruction of Congress stems from Trump's refusal to cooperate with the House proceedings and his insistence that his top officials do the same.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Nancy Pelosi", "Donald Trump", "Joe Biden"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's articles of impeachment will likely be transmitted \"soon\" to the Senate, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Jan. 9.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//s.hurriyet.com.tr/hdnstatic/dist/images/hdn.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's articles of impeachment will likely be transmitted \"soon\" to the Senate, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Jan. 9.", "keywords": "Nancy Pelosi,Donald Trump,Joe Biden", "news_keywords": "Nancy Pelosi,Donald Trump,Joe Biden", "og": {"title": "Pelosi: Trump impeachment articles to be sent 'soon' - World News", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's articles of impeachment will likely be transmitted \"soon\" to the Senate, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Jan. 9.", "image": "https://i.hurimg.com/i/hdn/75/200x200/5e18275a2269a221dcee457d.jpg", "site_name": "H\u00fcrriyet Daily News", "url": "https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/pelosi-trump-impeachment-articles-to-be-sent-soon-150799", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@HDNER", "url": "https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/pelosi-trump-impeachment-articles-to-be-sent-soon-150799", "title": "Pelosi: Trump impeachment articles to be sent 'soon' - World News", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's articles of impeachment will likely be transmitted \"soon\" to the Senate, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Jan. 9.", "image": {"src": "https://i.hurimg.com/i/hdn/75/200x200/5e18275a2269a221dcee457d.jpg"}, "account_id": 87645208}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/pelosi-trump-impeachment-articles-to-be-sent-soon-150799"}
