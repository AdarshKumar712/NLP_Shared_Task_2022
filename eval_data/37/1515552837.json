Despite a few moments of levity and camaraderie, this debate was markedly tenser than some of its predecessors as the frontrunners sought to capitalize on their momentum, while those who lagged behind endeavored to stay in the game. Attacks were more direct, and ideological contrasts more clearly defined.\n\nHere are five of the night\u2019s key takeaways:\n\nModerates sought to dominate the center lane \u2013 and take down Sanders\n\nRelated: Democratic candidates zero in on Buttigieg and Sanders at tense debate\n\nAmy Klobuchar made an especially strong showing. Americans are looking for a candidate who can attract a broad coalition of support, \u201cand I would submit that is me,\u201d the Minnesota senator said.\n\n\u201cI like Bernie just fine,\u201d she said of Sanders, the progressive Vermont senator. \u201cWe actually have worked together on a number of things\u201d. But she argued that Democrats were \u201cbetter off\u201d with someone who could win in red districts.\n\nPlaying up her midwestern values, Klobuchar also appealed directly to voters. \u201cI know you. I will fight for you, \u201c she said. \u201cIf you have trouble deciding if you are going to pay for your childcare or your long-term care, I know you and I will fight for you. If you have trouble figuring out if you\u2019re going to fill your refrigerator or prescription, I know you and I will fight for you.\u201d\n\nFollowing the debate, her campaign saw a fundraising surge.\n\nJoe Biden made a case for himself as well, going after Sanders\u2019 record on gun control and his embrace of the \u201csocialist\u201d label, while promoting his own long legacy in government and his partnership with Barack Obama. \u201cI was there,\u201d the former vice-president said repeatedly as he listed diplomatic and legislative victories including the signing of the Paris climate agreement.\n\nPete Buttigieg took a swipe at Sanders as well, saying that America needed a candidate who could unite them, rather than \u201cdividing people with the politics that says \u2018if you don\u2019t go all the way to the edge, it doesn\u2019t count;\u2019 a politics that says \u2018my way or the highway.\u2019\u201d\n\nBiden and Sanders spoke the most\n\nBoth candidates spoke for about 20 minutes each, ahead of the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Buttigieg and Klobuchar. The most vocal candidates were also often the most willing to go on the offensive.\n\nSanders and Buttigieg, who both declared victory after the Iowa caucuses, sparred over campaign finance, among other topics. \u201cUnlike some of the campaigns up here \u2013 Pete \u2013 I don\u2019t have 40 billionaires contributing to my campaign,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nButtigieg, as he has in the past, responded that unlike other candidates \u2013 including Sanders \u2013 he wasn\u2019t a millionaire or a billionaire. Later, he added: \u201cI will not pursue politics by telling people they can\u2019t be by our side.\u201d\n\nThough the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren placed third in Iowa, she spoke for less time than competitors who had received less support. Political commentators noted she often faded into the background for long stretches \u2013 both because moderators seemed to single her out less often and because she wasn\u2019t as aggressive as her competitors in stealing the spotlight.\n\nThe Democratic frontrunners \u2013 all of them white \u2013 grappled with race\n\n\n\nWith all the candidates of color, save Andrew Yang, having either dropped out of the presidential race or failed to qualify for the debate, a group of white frontrunners tried to make a case for why each of them was best suited to win over black and Latino voters.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe should set up a commission on race to retell the story of the last 400 years,\u201d said Tom Steyer. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about Jim Crow, let\u2019s talk about Martin Luther King Jr, let\u2019s talk about Barbara Lee, the congresswoman from Oakland who is one of our great leaders.\u201d\n\nSteyer singled out Biden, calling on him to disavow racist comments from a campaign surrogate. Biden responded that he had earned endorsements from many black lawmakers, \u201cdouble what you have or anybody else has\u201d.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Maanvi Singh"], "publish_date": "Sat Feb  8 06:48:49 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar battled over the center lane amid questions over race and party unityThe Democratic debate in New Hampshire topped off a turbulent week for Democrats, marked by chaos at the Iowa caucuses and continuing fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s Senate acquittal.For more than two and", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar battled over the center lane amid questions over race and party unityThe Democratic debate in New Hampshire topped off a turbulent week for Democrats, marked by chaos at the Iowa caucuses and continuing fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s Senate acquittal.For more than two and", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ADRPN970VMxMedRkfWuAhw--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f325bb11251c3b69b583af190a9b7a05", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ADRPN970VMxMedRkfWuAhw--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f325bb11251c3b69b583af190a9b7a05"}, "title": "Democratic debate: key takeaways from the most bruising evening yet"}, "application-name": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines", "oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "news_keywords": "Democratic candidates, Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Democratic debate, Joe Biden, Iowa caucuses, Barack Obama, senator Elizabeth Warren, Sanders", "googlebot": "noindex", "bingbot": "noindex", "robots": "noindex", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=f522527c-e901-3feb-895f-fd5fbc4ec882&src=web", "description": "Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar battled over the center lane amid questions over race and party unityThe Democratic debate in New Hampshire topped off a turbulent week for Democrats, marked by chaos at the Iowa caucuses and continuing fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s Senate acquittal.For more than two and", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ADRPN970VMxMedRkfWuAhw--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f325bb11251c3b69b583af190a9b7a05", "description": "Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar battled over the center lane amid questions over race and party unityThe Democratic debate in New Hampshire topped off a turbulent week for Democrats, marked by chaos at the Iowa caucuses and continuing fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s Senate acquittal.For more than two and", "title": "Democratic debate: key takeaways from the most bruising evening yet", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/democratic-debate-key-takeaways-most-064849699.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 338028696036, "app_id": 458584288257241}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=f522527c-e901-3feb-895f-fd5fbc4ec882&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=f522527c-e901-3feb-895f-fd5fbc4ec882&src=web"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://news.yahoo.com/democratic-debate-key-takeaways-most-064849699.html"}
