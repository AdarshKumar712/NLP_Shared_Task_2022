He joined experts a day after 4.4 million Italians went back to work and restrictions on personal movement were eased for the first time in two months.\n\nBrusaferro says the key to keeping the outbreak under control lies in the early isolation of people with suspected infection, more tests and the quarantine of their close contacts. He says it will require \u201ca huge investment\u201d of resources for training medical personnel to monitor possible new cases. He adds any phone app that can help trace contacts, while useful, doesn\u2019t substitute for the actions of people.\n\nThe head of the institute\u2019s infectious disease department, Dr. Giovanni Rezza, told La Repubblica the coming weeks were essentially an \u201cexperiment\u201d to see how the infection curve reacts to the easing of the lockdown and production shutdown.\n\n\u201cWe are not out of the epidemic. We are still in it. I don\u2019t want people to think there\u2019s no more risk and we go back to normal,\u201d Rezza told La Repubblica.\n\nIn Italy\u2019s hard-hit northern Lombardy, tens of thousands of sick overwhelmed the health care system. Scientists say a second wave of infection would particularly hit the south, which didn\u2019t have many infections.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue May  5 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "ROME \u2014 Italian experts are warning a second wave of coronavirus infections will most certainly accompany Italy\u2019s gradual reopening from Europe\u2019s first lockdown.
