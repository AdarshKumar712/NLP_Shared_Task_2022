As we forecast, China abandoned a numerical GDP target for 2020, with the Government Work Report placing more emphasis on job market stabilization and improving people\u2019s livelihoods. The absence of a growth objective means Beijing will not use stimulus to meet its longstanding goal of doubling 2010 GDP by 2020.\n\nAlthough the quantitative target was omitted, there is an official nominal GDP growth assumption of 5.4% for 2020 implied by this year\u2019s fiscal deficit goal of 3.76 trillion yuan ($527 billion) or 3.6% of GDP. Based on the consumer price index inflation target of 3.5%, Beijing\u2019s underlying expectation for real GDP growth is around 1.9% for 2020 \u2014 which is in line with our growth forecast of 2%.\n\nThe report pledges a \u201cmore proactive\u201d fiscal policy in 2020. The official budget deficit target was raised 80 base points to 3.6% of GDP. Special local government bond issuance quota also rose substantially up 74% year-on-year to 3.75 trillion yuan. Proceeds from 1 trillion yuan Covid-19 special treasury bond will be transferred directly to city- and county-level local governments for public spending.\n\n\n\n\n\nInfrastructure growth revival\n\nWhile the report does not provide total infrastructure investment targets, it places a policy focus on \u201cnew infrastructure\u201d and new style urbanization construction. The much-hyped new infrastructure investment includes high-speed rail and 5G networks but is neither new nor sufficiently large to drive up fixed asset investment growth. The new style of urbanization construction, however, which includes building public facilities and increasing urban service provision, is more significant. We have long highlighted the considerable scope to increase urban services infrastructure investment. The policy focus will support 2020 growth and boost household service consumption down the line.\n\nThe report confirms our expectation of a classic China infrastructure stimulus. Indeed, the stimulus is already under way. Our high frequency trackers \u2014 including cement prices and heavy-duty truck and excavator sales \u2014 show that infrastructure investment is ramping up. The easing of local government financing vehicle borrowing restrictions and the newly launched infrastructure real estate investment trust pilot program will provide additional funding support. The increased bond issuance quota, the acceleration of credit growth and the political \u201call clear\u201d signal from the NPC all point to infrastructure investment accelerating further in the coming months.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials reiterated that prudent monetary policy will be more flexible and appropriate, specifying that M2 and total social financing (TSF) growth should be significantly above the 2019 rate. This is in line with earlier People\u2019s Bank of China signals that \u201ccontrolling macro leverage\u201d is no longer a priority. In our view, the bank will further step up easing measures, including guiding down the loan prime rate, keeping liquidity abundant and expanding credit facilities to support targeted sectors. Consequently, we expect credit growth to continue to increase: TSF growth will reach 14% by end-2020, well above the 10.7% recorded in 2019. In addition to stronger bank loans and bond issuance, we expect the easing of shadow banking regulations to help small and medium enterprises and therefore support employment.\n\nMeanwhile, banks will extend loan relief to smaller businesses until March 2021.\n\nBeijing set a target of creating 9 million new urban jobs, 2 million fewer than last year and a surveyed urban unemployment rate 50 base points higher \u2014 at 6%. Despite the swift resumption of industrial production, unemployment remains high: the urban rate was 6% in April, up from 5.2% in December. The real number is much higher as headline indicators do not cover all 291 million migrant workers. Moreover, a weak recovery in consumption means the services sector, the key job generator in the last five years, will take time to return to normal employment levels.\n\nNo housing stimulus, for now. On property, the core message remains \u201chomes are for living in, not for speculation.\u201d This means national property easing is unlikely in the near term. However, given the massive contraction in fiscal revenue growth this year and significant employment pressure, we think that property stimulus with more prime land auctions and housing construction activity is not only still likely but will, in fact, be necessary after the third quarter of 2020.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this opinion section are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the editorial positions of Caixin Media.\n\nIf you would like to write an opinion for Caixin Global, please send your ideas or finished opinions to our email: opinionen@caixin.com", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon May 25 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Opinion: China to Increase Infrastructure Spending, but No Housing Stimulus for Now - However, slowdown in fiscal revenue growth and significant employment pressure means property stimulus likely in late 2020", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"description": "Opinion: China to Increase Infrastructure Spending, but No Housing Stimulus for Now - However, slowdown in fiscal revenue growth and significant employment pressure means property stimulus likely in late 2020", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1177372413", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og": {"image": "//file.caixin.com/en/web/img/caixin-share.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@caixinglobal", "url": "https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-05-25/opinion-china-to-increase-infrastructure-spending-but-no-housing-stimulus-for-now-101558546.html?cxg=web&Sfrom=twitter", "creator": "@By Bo Zhuang, Jonathan Fenby and Rory Green", "title": "Opinion: China to Increase Infrastructure Spending, but No Housing Stimulus for Now", "description": "However, slowdown in fiscal revenue growth and significant employment pressure means property stimulus likely in late 2020", "image": "https://img.caixin.com/2020-05-25/1590389950130494_560_373.jpg"}, "googlebot": "noarchive", "robots": "noarchive"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-05-25/opinion-china-to-increase-infrastructure-spending-but-no-housing-stimulus-for-now-101558546.html"}
