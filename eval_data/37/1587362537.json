I miss you my boy. Love always and forever, Mom.\u201d Olivia Sullivan/staff photo\n\nOutside of the Westway Community Center in Federal Way, a memorial honors the life of a 19-year-old man who was shot and killed Monday night.\n\nJust after 10:40 p.m. April 20, Federal Way police responded to reports of a shooting at the community center in the 33400 block of 21st Avenue SW. A male victim was found near the building, and although life-saving measures were attempted by first responders, he died at the scene.\n\nThe victim has been identified as 19-year-old Damien Helmbrecht. His cause of death was a gunshot wound to the torso and the death has been ruled a homicide, according to the King County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office.\n\nCandles, bouquets of flowers, balloons, empty liquor bottles and handwritten notes are now placed at the corner of the community center\u2019s driveway.\n\nTucked in a bundle of pink roses, a handwritten note reads: \u201cMy son, Damien. I miss you my boy. Love always and forever, Mom.\u201d\n\nA motive for the shooting has not been determined, and Federal Way police have not located any suspects. Investigation of the incident is still underway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk to us Please share your story tips by emailing editor@federalwaymirror.com.
