This presents ever-growing challenges in providing assistance for Irish citizens who get into difficulty overseas.\n\n\u201cWhile most journeys overseas go smoothly, the 2019 statistics show that things can and do go wrong and that it is important to be prepared. As people consider travel plans for the year ahead, I urge them to get comprehensive travel insurance.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Major incidents such as terrorist attacks, protests and missing people prompt calls", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/assets/images/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "Major incidents such as terrorist attacks, protests and missing people prompt calls", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14128156"}, "news_keywords": "News, Nora Quoirin, Simon Coveney, Department Of Foreign Affairs, Colombo(LK), Dublin(IE), Hong Kong, Kenya, South America, Sri Lanka", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "Over 1,700 Irish citizens required DFA assistance overseas in 2019", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/over-1-700-irish-citizens-required-dfa-assistance-overseas-in-2019-1.4128156", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "Major incidents such as terrorist attacks, protests and missing people prompt calls", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4128155&origw=1440", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4128155&origw=1440", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimes", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/over-1-700-irish-citizens-required-dfa-assistance-overseas-in-2019-1.4128156", "title": "Over 1,700 Irish citizens required DFA assistance overseas in 2019", "description": "Major incidents such as terrorist attacks, protests and missing people prompt calls", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128155.1577877235!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/over-1-700-irish-citizens-required-dfa-assistance-overseas-in-2019-1.4128156"}
