Once completed, the AUD500,000 study will offer models to assess the impact of technological research and applications on productivity and GDP growth in Vietnam.\n\nAustralian Ambassador to Vietnam Robyn Mudie hailed the study as an excellent example of how Australia and Vietnam can turn high-level cooperation in innovation between the two countries into meaningful, real projects.\n\nThrough cooperation with the MOST, the Data61 research team will join Vietnamese experts to develop effective models and further strengthen decision-making processes based on specific scientific evidence, thus bringing greater value to Vietnam\u2019s investment in science-technology and innovation, she said.\n\nAccording to MOST Deputy Minister Bui The Duy, this is the first time such a study has been conducted in Vietnam, making it a good opportunity for Vietnam to approach new and creative practices in building policies.\n\nHe stressed the MOST\u2019s high appreciation of all the models obtained from the research results and their transfer to the ministry for use and replication, affirming this as the spirit of innovative partnerships.\n\nThe study will be implemented based on recommendations from a 2019 report on the future of Vietnam\u2019s digital economy until 2030 and 2045, also funded by the Australian government. The report proposes that there should be an indicator to measure the economic impact of innovation activities, thus promoting the development of Vietnam\u2019s innovation ecosystem and building the necessary capacity to meet challenges and opportunities, such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The implementation of this study with Data61 will help to build on results from similar studies conducted in Australia as well as in other developed and developing countries.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["vietnam news", "vietnam business", "vietnam travel", "vietnam culture", "vietnam sports", "vietnam politics", "hanoi", "saigon", "ho chi minh city", "apec", "da nang", "hue", "hoi an", "vietnam development", "asean", "nhandan", "vietnam arts", "vietnam food", "vietnam english", "vietnam war", "vietnam history", "vietnam headlines", "vietnam government", "vietnam people", "east sea", "south china sea", "paracel", "spratly", "hoang sa", "truong sa", "ha long bay", "son doong"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "NDO \u2013 The Australian Embassy in Vietnam on March 12 stated that the Australian government has announced its support for Vietnam to implement a study themed \u201cTechnological change in Vietnam \u2013 How technology contributes to productivity and economic growth.\u201d", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/images/xfavicon.ico.pagespeed.ic.5Kny1EiEm9.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Australia supports Vietnam to evaluate the impact of technology on productivity and growth", "image": "https://en.nhandan.org.vn/cdn/en/media/k2/items/src/848/b754376906070f78ea80b76c212292e3.jpg", "description": "NDO \u2013 The Australian Embassy in Vietnam on March 12 stated that the Australian government has announced its support for Vietnam to implement a study themed \u201cTechnological change in Vietnam \u2013 How technology contributes to productivity and economic growth.\u201d", "keywords": "vietnam news, vietnam business, vietnam travel, vietnam culture, vietnam sports, vietnam politics, hanoi, saigon, ho chi minh city, apec, da nang, hue, hoi an, vietnam development, asean, nhandan, vietnam arts, vietnam food, vietnam english, vietnam war, vietnam history, vietnam headlines, vietnam government, vietnam people, east sea, south china sea, paracel, spratly, hoang sa, truong sa, ha long bay, son doong", "copyright": "Nhan Dan Online - VietNam Nh\u00e2n D\u00e2n Newspaper", "og": {"title": "Australia supports Vietnam to evaluate the impact of technology on productivity and growth", "type": "article", "image": "https://en.nhandan.org.vn/cdn/en/media/k2/items/src/848/b754376906070f78ea80b76c212292e3.jpg", "description": "NDO \u2013 The Australian Embassy in Vietnam on March 12 stated that the Australian government has announced its support for Vietnam to implement a study themed \u201cTechnological change in Vietnam \u2013 How technology contributes to productivity and economic growth.\u201d", "url": "https://en.nhandan.org.vn/scitech/sci-tech/item/8484702-australia-supports-vietnam-to-evaluate-the-impact-of-technology-on-productivity-and-growth.html"}, "robots": "index,follow", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "url": "https://en.nhandan.org.vn/scitech/sci-tech/item/8484702-australia-supports-vietnam-to-evaluate-the-impact-of-technology-on-productivity-and-growth.html", "title": "Australia supports Vietnam to evaluate the impact of technology on productivity and growth", "description": "NDO \u2013 The Australian Embassy in Vietnam on March 12 stated that the Australian government has announced its support for Vietnam to implement a study themed \u201cTechnological change in Vietnam \u2013 How technology contributes to productivity and economic growth.\u201d", "image": "https://en.nhandan.org.vn/cdn/en/media/k2/items/src/848/b754376906070f78ea80b76c212292e3.jpg", "site": "@ND\u0110T", "creator": "@ND\u0110T"}}, "canonical_link": "https://en.nhandan.org.vn/scitech/sci-tech/item/8484702-australia-supports-vietnam-to-evaluate-the-impact-of-technology-on-productivity-and-growth.html"}
