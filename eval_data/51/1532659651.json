A lot of the girls didn't play varsity last year,\" Mackall said. \"We put it together. We put some things in place. We had some ups and downs. But I'm proud of what the young ladies brought and what the young ladies accomplished. They had to learn me as I learn them. Sometimes, you don't have enough time to make it happen.\n\n\"We made a little run at the end,\" Mackall continued. PVHS beat Adams City and Westminster high schools in successive games to close out the regular season The wins snapped a four-game losing streak at the time. \"We wish a few games would have went differently. We wish we had a higher seed. We would have met them in the first, second or third round. I'm so proud of what my young ladies did.\"\n\nAs for the game itself, Mountain Vista High School scored 43 of the first half's last 57 points and went on to an 80-45 win on the Golden Eagles' court Feb. 25.\n\n\"It was one of those nights where things just don't go your way, except for the first five to seven minutes,\" said PVHS' first-year coach, Sam Mackall. \"They had great defense, and we'd known that coming into the game. We played with them on their game, and that was the biggest difference. They are, rightfully so, going on to the next round. They deserved it.\"\n\nMVHS faces Broomfield in the second round Friday, Feb. 28. PVHS finished the season with a record of 10-14 and its sixth straight state playoff berth.\n\nThe teams traded the first 18 points of the game.
