Here are 8 signs to know if what you have is truly stable or not.\n\nBeing in a relationship is always exciting, but the rush of feelings often alters our sense of perception and makes us ignore some serious red flags. A long-term relationship isn\u2019t easy and over the years, you might go through some really tough times when you will feel like that your relationship has finally hit rock bottom. And that\u2019s when you need to look out for signs that your relationship is stable or not.\n\nStability in a relationship is not an all-time guaranteed offer. Regardless of how stable your relationship really is, there will be arguments, and there will be problems. The foundation of a stable relationship is built on trust, safety and loyalty. And if you guys have that, it doesn\u2019t really matter what hardships life throws at you because together you will make it through.\n\nOn that note, let\u2019s look at 8 signs that tell you are finally in a stable relationship.\n\n1. You support each other\u2019s individual growth\n\nCouples in a stable relationship feel confident and safe with each other, which is why they support each other\u2019s accomplishments as individuals. They will feel happy and help with each other\u2019s career and hobbies. On the other hand, when someone in the relationship is insecure, they might spend all their energy to keep their partner from doing what they love by distracting them.\n\n2. You constantly rediscover each other\n\nCouples in a stable relationship connect with each other in more than just one way. The partners like to learn more about each other with each passing day. This has mostly to do with the passion, experiences and interests. From little gestures like asking each other about their day to big changes, they find a way to adapt to each other and they love it. Whereas, in an unstable relationship, these things almost disappear.\n\n3. You are comfortable spending time apart\n\nBeing able to do your own thing without worrying that your relationship might suffer is a solid sign that your relationship is stable. When you are in an unstable relationship, there is a constant fear that you will lose your partner if you focus on yourself or think about doing something individually.\n\n4. You express your feelings\n\nThis includes love, affection, frustration and anger. You don\u2019t give each other a silent treatment every time you disagree. One of the most important aspects of a stable relationship is that you are able to resolve a conflict without the silent treatment.\n\n5. You don\u2019t play the blame game\n\nIn a stable relationship, you\u2019re both able to let go of the unimportant things and don\u2019t fight to get an upper hand in the argument. You will need to feel the need to blame your partner for the mistakes. A stable couple tries to understand each other\u2019s point of view with communicating in a healthy way.\n\n6. You try to make their relationship work\n\nWorking on the relationship is a sure-shot sign of being emotionally mature enough to have a healthy bond. It is like providing emotional support to the partner when the going gets tough. It is also about giving up on silly problems and looking at the big picture.\n\n7. You are not the only one making compromises\n\nCompromise is always a two-way street in a stable relationship. You prioritise each other\u2019s needs and accept each other\u2019s decision. There is a balance in your relationship that makes it healthy and stable.\n\n8. You are sure about the future\n\nYou met someone. Life is beautiful. You\u2019re happy. Fast forward to a few months and that\u2019s when you start thinking if this relationship is meant to be. But don\u2019t worry! If you are with the right person, then the thought of your partner leaving you will not plague your mind. You will be certain about the future when you\u2019re in a stable relationship.\n\nALSO READ: THESE are the signs that show you are dating a commitment phobe\n\nALSO READ: 7 Signs prove that you are in a rebound relationship\n\nWhere would we be without our moms?
