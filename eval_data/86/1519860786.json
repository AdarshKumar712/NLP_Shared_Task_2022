Another country that is in the same situation as Cuba is Nicaragua, a nation that for several years has been asking to be included in the event nut has not gotten any positive response from the CBPC.\n\nNevertheless, Colombia and Panama do count on the support of Puello to participate in the Caribbean Series, as said by Puello himself, ``they can be a tough nut to crack\u00b4\u00b4.\n\n``They have fought and showed enough quality; there is no doubt about it, there is a balance, no one will find any weak teams in the Caribbean Series\u00b4\u00b4, added Puello, although Panama and Colombia were the first two teams to be eliminated from the tournament.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["baseball", "puertorico", "cuba", "caribbean series"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Havana, (RHC) \u2013 Cuba will be absent from the 2021 edition of the Caribbean Series, informed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Juan Francisco Puello, president of the Caribbean Professional Baseball Confederation (CBPC).", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.radiohc.cu/images/logo-color.png", "meta_data": {"keywords": "baseball, puertorico, cuba, caribbean series", "description": "Havana, (RHC) \u2013 Cuba will be absent from the 2021 edition of the Caribbean Series, informed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Juan Francisco Puello, president of the Caribbean Professional Baseball Confederation (CBPC).", "og": {"title": "Cuba will not be invited to the Caribbean Series in 2021", "image": "https://www.radiohc.cu/articles/2470-serie-baseball.jpeg", "description": "Havana, (RHC) \u2013 Cuba will be absent from the 2021 edition of the Caribbean Series, informed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Juan Francisco Puello, president of the Caribbean Professional Baseball Confederation (CBPC).", "locale": "en", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.radiohc.cu/en/noticias/deportes/213912-cuba-will-not-be-invited-to-the-caribbean-series-in-2021"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.radiohc.cu/en/noticias/deportes/213912-cuba-will-not-be-invited-to-the-caribbean-series-in-2021"}
