All sides urgently need to take steps to de-escalate,\" said the minister in a statement sent to the Austrian Press Agency (APA) on Monday.\n\n\"It will not be possible to use violence to create sustainable security and stability in the region. Therefore, a clear willingness to engage in dialogue is needed from all sides,\" he added.\n\nThe minister also stressed that Austria supports Josep Borrell, EU high representative for foreign affairs and security, in his efforts to find a political solution to the conflict, and Vienna is available as a place for dialogue at any time.\n\nRegarding Tehran's announcement that it would ignore all the restrictions in terms of the numbers or type of centrifuges that can be operated or the level of enrichment that it can pursue under the 2015 nuclear deal, the statement said that from an Austrian perspective, the question of the continued validity of the deal should be seen separately from the current tensions.\n\n\"If Iran implemented its announcement to operate uranium enrichment without restrictions, this would contradict the Vienna nuclear deal and should be clearly condemned. We therefore appeal to Iran not to implement this announcement and to return to the full implementation of the agreement,\" said Schallenberg.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Jan  7 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"publishid": "138683230.12.49.0", "pageid": "2.4.0.0.11110320.0.0.0.0.0.11204.138683230", "renderer": "webkit", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no", "format-detection": "email=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no"}, "canonical_link": ""}
