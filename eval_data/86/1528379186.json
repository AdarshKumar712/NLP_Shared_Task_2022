Monday\u2019s hearing is expected to last a week and then resume for a second session starting on May 18.\n\nAny ruling is likely to be appealed by the losing side and Assange could remain locked up in a high-security London prison for many more months.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really understand why Julian is in jail here,\u201d Assange\u2019s father John Shipton told the crowd on London\u2019s Parliament Square.\n\nOthers attending included Pink Floyd rock group co-founder Roger Waters and Greece\u2019s former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis.\n\nFashion designer and activist Vivienne Westwood wore a neon green paper halo with the word \u201cangel\u201d written in black marker.\n\nAssange was \u201cthe angel of democracy,\u201d she explained.\n\nThe case was injected with a dose of intrigue last week when the defence claimed US President Donald Trump had promised to pardon Assange if he denied Russia leaked emails of his 2016 election rival\u2019s campaign.\n\nUS intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian GRU military intelligence agencies hacked the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in the runup to the November vote.\n\nWikiLeaks then published the stolen emails. Assange has previously said that he received them from through his website\u2019s anonymous file-sharing system and had no idea who obtained them first.\n\nThe DNC hack plays no role in the US case against Assange and Trump denied promising a pardon.\n\nBut the court said last week that the evidence was admissible.\n\nAFP", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Feb 22 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "//www.channelstv.com/wp-content/themes/channels2016/images/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "6JVFjvtKtlBAOBeZjx02KYOCAJqmYfH--9_EmfNIsw8", "alexaVerifyID": "s6Y-9oImS488Fgxe-Oc84mxGsd8", "msvalidate.01": "51A9C00FE7BE8C94DDAE034F74141D4A", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=674628071", "theme-color": "#00265E", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#00265E", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Protesters Rally For Assange Ahead Of Extradition Hearing In UK", "description": "Protesters Rally For Assange Ahead Of Extradition Hearing In UK", "image": "https://www.channelstv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/UK-Protesters.jpg", "url": "https://www.channelstv.com/2020/02/22/protesters-rally-for-assange-ahead-of-extradition-hearing-in-uk/", "site_name": "Channels Television"}, "fb": {"app_id": 205604876116272}, "application-name": "Channels Television", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "small.jpg", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "medium.jpg", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "wide.jpg", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "large.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00265E", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.channelstv.com/2020/02/22/protesters-rally-for-assange-ahead-of-extradition-hearing-in-uk/"}
