It is the musical score of the movie composed by Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir and does not include the many other songs played in the movie. You will have to go looking elsewhere for those.\n\nNow that we have covered what the CD is not, let\u2019s talk about what it actually is. Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir has opted for a classical style orchestra for this soundtrack, although there are occasionally some sound effects thrown in amongst the traditional strings, percussion and woodwind instruments. The accompanying material says that the composition \u2018features the cello as the centerpiece of the score, leading string-based melodies played by a symphony orchestra of 90 musicians\u2019.\n\nAs you can see from the track listing below most tracks are quite short. The two longest tracks are probably pivotal moments in the film and possibly Joker\u2019s life.\n\n1 Hoyt\u2019s Office 01:24\n\n2 Defeated Clown 02:39\n\n3 Following Sophie 01:33\n\n4 Penny in the Hospital 01:18\n\n5 Young Penny 02:01\n\n6 Meeting Bruce Wayne 04:35\n\n7 Hiding in the Fridge 01:23\n\n8 A Bad Comedian 01:28\n\n9 Arthur Comes to Sophie 01:39\n\n10 Looking for Answers 00:51\n\n11 Penny Taken to the Hospital 01:49\n\n12 Subway 03:33\n\n13 Bathroom Dance 02:08\n\n14 Learning How to Act Normal 01:17\n\n15 Confession 01:29\n\n16 Escape from the Train 02:31\n\n17 Call Me Joker 04:48\n\nAll told we have 17 tracks giving a running time of only 37 minutes which seems a little short to me.\n\nI should have said that the tone of the score is somewhere between sombre, melancholy and ominous depending on which track your listening to. One of the things you can\u2019t say about it is \u2018it\u2019s a jolly little tune\u2019. I have to say though that I thought it was very well done given the subject matter of the film.\n\nThat last sentence brings me to point out that to get the very best out of this soundtrack you really need to see the film. It will give you goosebumps. The \u2018Subway\u2019 track always makes me nervous. Perhaps that\u2019s why the CD is short on running time, any longer could lead to a breakdown.\n\nThis is the first of Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir\u2019s work that I have actually listened to and I am very impressed. For any fan of the film who is not of a nervous disposition, then you really should treat yourself and get a copy. You can get the CD or Vinyl picture disc or even a coloured vinyl configuration whatever that is.\n\nAndy Whitaker\n\nDecember 2019\n\n(pub: WaterTower Music, 2019. 1 CD 17 tracks 37 minutes.
