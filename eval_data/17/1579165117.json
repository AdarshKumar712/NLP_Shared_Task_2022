During these difficult times, it is critical that Canadians be able to obtain credible information and access services to support their mental health and wellbeing.\n\nThat's why today, the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health, launched a new portal dedicated to mental wellness on Canada.ca/coronavirus and the Canada COVID-19 app. Wellness Together Canada will connect Canadians to peer support workers, social workers, psychologists and other professionals for confidential chat sessions or phone calls, and will make it easier to find credible information and help address mental health and substance use issues.\n\nThe portal is the result of the work of a broad consortium of organizations with experience in providing digital mental health and substance use support, led by Stepped Care Solutions, Kids Help Phone, Homewood Health and Greenspace Health. Wellness Together Canada is the first and only mental health platform of its kind for people of all ages, in every province and territory.\n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to supporting partners including:\n\n\u2022 Bell Let's Talk\n\n\u2022 Canada Health Infoway\n\n\u2022 Mental Health Commission of Canada\n\n\u2022 Canadian Psychological Association\n\n\u2022 Medavie\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Health care", "Health Canada", "Canada", "Mental health services", "general public", "news releases", "Hon.
