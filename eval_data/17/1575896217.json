After meeting the leaders of Germany\u2019s 16 states, Merkel reiterated that the public finances were secondary for the government at the time of a health crisis like coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhile Germany has a self-imposed policy of not taking a new debt, Mekel said that the debt brake rule provides for exceptions in extraordinary situations. The German Chancellor added that budget balance is not the government\u2019s primary concern right now. She said that the first task is to save people\u2019s lives and, secondly, to keep economic activity going.\n\nMerkel had earlier said that Berlin is open to scrapping the self-imposed zero-deficit rule to fight against the novel coronavirus outbreak. She did not rule out the suspension of the zero-deficit rule targeted at fiscal prudence and said that the administration will prioritise the virus crisis.\n\nRead: German Chancellor Merkel Open To Scrap Zero-deficit Rule To Combat Coronavirus\n\n'No known cure'\n\nSpeaking at a news conference on March 11, Merkel said that Germany is focussed on slowing the spread of the virus since there is no known cure of the deadly infection. She also warned that up to 70 per cent of the country\u2019s population is vulnerable to the novel coronavirus. Europe has been witnessing a dramatic rise in the number of coronavirus cases with Italy being the worst-hit. Italy has reported over 15,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and more than 1,000 people have died due to the global pandemic.\n\nRead: Germany's Angela Merkel Denied Handshake By Minister Over Coronavirus Dread, Watch Video\n\nOn March 11, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus as pandemic which has forced governments to take drastic measures to contain the disease. Speaking at a press briefing, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed concern about alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of inaction.\n\n\u201cWe have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic,\u201d said Ghebreyesus.\n\nRead: Ellen DeGeneres, Jimmy Fallon To Film Without Live Audience Amid Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nRead: Coronavirus Outbreak: Top Adviser To Iran's Ali Khamenei Quarantined With Virus Symptoms", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["german chancellor", "angela merkel", "coronavirus"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "German Chancellor called the coronavirus crisis \u201cmore unusual\u201d than the banking crisis since the evolving health challenge has not been answered by scientists.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.republicworld.com/assets/images/favicons/favicon-16x16.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "German Chancellor called the coronavirus crisis \u201cmore unusual\u201d than the banking crisis since the evolving health challenge has not been answered by scientists.", "keywords": "german chancellor,angela merkel,coronavirus", "news_keywords": "german chancellor,angela merkel,coronavirus", "copyright": "Republic World", "msvalidate.01": "46255256F7B435C502CFADCCBD97D1C9", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5136", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.republicworld.com/assets/images/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ff5136", "fb": {"app_id": 1923161321262442, "pages": 1159346367512575}, "og": {"type": "article", "locale": "en_US", "title": "German Chancellor Merkel calls coronavirus 'more unusual' than banking crisis - Republic World", "url": "https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest-of-the-world-news/german-chancellor-merkel-calls-coronavirus-more-unsual-than-banking", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xxhdpi/nbitebnhmzitk86z_1584077024.jpeg?tr=f-jpeg", "url": "https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xxhdpi/nbitebnhmzitk86z_1584077024.jpeg?tr=f-jpeg", "secure_url": "https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xxhdpi/nbitebnhmzitk86z_1584077024.jpeg?tr=f-jpeg", "type": "image/png", "width": 1024, "height": 1024}, "site_name": "Republic World", "description": "German Chancellor called the coronavirus crisis \u201cmore unusual\u201d than the banking crisis since the evolving health challenge has not been answered by scientists.", "see_also": "https://www.republicworld.com/"}, "article": {"author": "Republic World"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@republic", "creator": "@republic", "title": "German Chancellor Merkel calls coronavirus 'more unusual' than banking crisis - Republic World", "description": "German Chancellor called the coronavirus crisis \u201cmore unusual\u201d than the banking crisis since the evolving health challenge has not been answered by scientists.", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xxhdpi/nbitebnhmzitk86z_1584077024.jpeg", "alt": "MERKEL: CORONAVIRUS 'MORE UNSUAL' - Republic World"}, "player": {"width": 480, "height": 270}}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest-of-the-world-news/german-chancellor-merkel-calls-coronavirus-more-unsual-than-banking.html"}
