[], "text": "What your doctor is reading on Medscape.com:\n\nFEBRUARY 28, 2020, MEXICO CITY -- The first case of coronavirus in Mexico has been confirmed, the country's health authorities said today.\n\nThe first case is a 35-year-old patient from Mexico City with mild clinical manifestations and a history of travel to Italy in February, according to Deputy Health Minister Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell Ram\u00edrez, MD, PhD, at a press conference. The patient is currently hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER) in Mexico City.\n\nOn Thursday, the deputy health minister said that authorities were awaiting the test results of a second sample from the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE); those results were reported as positive today.\n\nTenemos un paciente sospechoso de #COVID19, hospitalizado en @RespiraINER. Es un caso leve y se ha puesto en aislamiento. Despu\u00e9s de un resultado reactivo en el INER, se est\u00e1 analizando una segunda muestra en el InDRE. \u2014 Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell Ram\u00edrez (@HLGatell) February 28, 2020\n\nDuring the press conference, L\u00f3pez-Gatell Ramirez added that the patient's eight close contacts are asymptomatic and isolated following the local protocol.\n\nA second case, in the state of Sinaloa, was identified as a 41-year-old man from Hidalgo with a history of travel to Italy. He is currently isolated in his hotel room in Sinaloa with a close contact.\n\nIn addition, it was reported that the two cases of patients with respiratory disease on a cruise ship docked in Cozumel Thursday were ruled out for coronavirus infection; they tested positive for influenza.\n\nMitigation Strategy\n\nL\u00f3pez-Gatell Ramirez stressed that, as established by the strategic plan of preparation and response from the World Health Organization (WHO), the objective is to limit transmission. To do this, patients need to be identified, isolated, and treated early, including providing optimized care for infected patients.\n\nAnother important aspect is the communication of critical information about risks and events to all communities, and to counteract misinformation.\n\nDuring Thursday's press conference on coronavirus, L\u00f3pez-Gatell Ramirez stressed that the mitigation strategy consists of \"limiting or reducing damage, impacts, and transmission speed. Containing the spread is not the goal....The aim is to limit 'damage,' meaning to reduce the speed of transmission, protect the most vulnerable populations, ensure a prompt and effective medical attention, and following up the epidemiologic studies to identify close contacts so that secondary transmission can be interrupted.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Coronavirus", "2019 Novel Coronavirus", "2019-nCoV", "Wuhan coronavirus", "Human coronavirus HKU1", "Human coronavirus OC43", "HCoV-OC43", "Human coronavirus 229E", "HCoV-229E", "infection control", "infection in the immunocompromised host", "disease management", "disease recurrence", "viral illness", "pandemic", "epidemic"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Mar 20 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The first case is a 35-year-old patient from Mexico City with mild clinical manifestations and a history of travel to Italy this month.
